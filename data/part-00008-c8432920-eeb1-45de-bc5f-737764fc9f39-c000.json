To help characterize\\nthe underlying mechanics associated with viscous erosion and crater formation,\\nexperimental measurements using regolith simulants and subsonic, non-reacting\\nflows were completed using compressed air in a splitter plate, plume cratering\\nsetup. More specifically, these investigations examined the underlying effects\\nof bulk density, cohesion, and exhaust flow characteristics on viscous erosion\\nrates and crater formation using Lunar highlands simulant (LHS-1), Lunar mare\\nsimulant (LMS-1), LHS-1D (Dust) simulants, and 40-80 um glass beads in\\natmosphere. Results show that particle size distribution can ultimately\\ninfluence crater shapes and erosion rates, likely owing to internal angle of\\nfriction. Measurements show that increasing bulk density, especially from an\\nuncompacted to a slightly compacted state, decreases erosion rate by as much as\\n50%. While cohesion of granular material can mitigate erosion rates to some\\nextent, higher levels of cohesion above 1,000 Pa may actually increase viscous\\nerosion rates due to particle clumping. A modified version of Metzger's (2024a)\\nequation for volumetric erosion rate is presented, with limitations discussed.\\nThese modified equations for viscous erosion, with limitations noted, show that\\ngeotechnical properties play an important role in viscous erosion and should be\\nconsidered in PSI computer models for future mission planning.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.space-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:51:21Z\"}"}
