{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05088v1\", \"title\": \"Topological links and knots of speckled light mediated by coherence\\n  singularities\", \"summary\": \"Links and knots are exotic topological structures that have garnered\\nsignificant interest across multiple branches of natural sciences. Coherent\\nlinks and knots, such as those constructed by phase or polarization\\nsingularities of coherent light, have been observed in various\\nthree-dimensional optical settings. However, incoherent links and knots -\\nknotted or connected lines of coherence singularities - arise from a\\nfundamentally different concept. They are hidden in the statistic properties of\\na randomly fluctuating field, making their presence often elusive or\\nundetectable. Here, we theoretically construct and experimentally demonstrate\\nsuch topological entities of incoherent light. By leveraging a state-of-the-art\\nincoherent modal-decomposition scheme, we unveil incoherent topological\\nstructures from fluctuating light speckles, including Hopf links and Trefoil\\nknots of coherence singularities that are robust against coherence and\\nintensity fluctuations. Our work is applicable to diverse wave systems where\\nincoherence or practical coherence is prevalent, and may pave the way for\\ndesign and implementation of statistically-shaped topological structures for\\nvarious applications such as high-dimensional optical information encoding and\\noptical communications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:58:25Z\"}"}
