{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21725v1\", \"title\": \"Low-noise environment for probing fundamental symmetries\", \"summary\": \"We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for\\nmeasuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules.\\nTo minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic\\nelectric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external\\nmagnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer\\nmu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial\\ndirection and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the\\ndifference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between\\nsections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field\\ninside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\\\\sqrt{{\\\\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and\\nabove, rising to 500 fT/$\\\\sqrt{{\\\\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical\\nstudies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13\\nfT/$\\\\sqrt{{\\\\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline\\nis maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric\\nfield of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below\\n1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the\\ndirection of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104\\nhours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for\\nmeasuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The\\ndesign principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly\\napplicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in\\nmolecules, atoms, and neutrons.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:37:12Z\"}"}
