{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04882v1\", \"title\": \"Observation of non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence in non-chiral\\n  non-unitary quantum dynamics of single photons\", \"summary\": \"The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of\\ntopological physics, is one of counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian\\nsystems, that is deeply rooted in symmetry. In particular, preserved chiral\\nsymmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in\\ndetermining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in\\nnon-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological\\ninvariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The\\ncorresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs\\nto be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental\\nefforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the\\nbulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system\\nwith chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum\\nwalks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we\\nexperimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall\\nstructure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The\\nappearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced\\nnon-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally\\nbuilds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle\\nfor studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry\\nbreaking.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.quant-gas,physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:43:43Z\"}"}
