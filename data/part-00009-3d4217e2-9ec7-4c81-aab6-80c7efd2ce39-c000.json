{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211v1\", \"title\": \"Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication\", \"summary\": \"Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a\\nsignal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also\\nhas no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of\\nthe emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours\\nthat have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such\\nfeedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was\\nintended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how\\ncommunication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we\\npresent a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an\\nunbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural\\ndifferences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine\\ncommunicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this\\noutcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of\\npsychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared\\nintentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of\\ncommunication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible\\nsocially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a\\ngeneral but well-developed capacity for social cognition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,physics.soc-ph,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:58:49Z\"}"}
