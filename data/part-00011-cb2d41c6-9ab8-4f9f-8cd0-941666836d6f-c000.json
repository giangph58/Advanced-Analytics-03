STO\\nmaintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing\\ncurvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency.\\nTo ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse\\nshrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration.\\nNumerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios\\ndemonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety.\\nMoreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:07:17Z\"}"}
