{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06692v1\", \"title\": \"SHiP experiment at the SPS Beam Dump Facility\", \"summary\": \"In 2024, the SHiP experiment, together with the associated Beam Dump Facility\\n(BDF) under the auspices of the High Intensity ECN3 (HI-ECN3) project, was\\nselected for the future physics exploitation of the ECN3 experimental facility\\nat the SPS. The SHiP experiment is a general-purpose intensity-frontier setup\\ndesigned to search for physics beyond the Standard Model in the domain of\\nFeebly Interacting Particles at the GeV-scale. It comprises a multi-system\\napparatus that provides discovery sensitivity to both decay and scattering\\nsignatures of models with feebly interacting particles, such as dark-sector\\nmediators, both elastic and inelastic light dark matter, as well as\\nmillicharged particles. The experiment will also be able to perform both\\nStandard Model measurements and Beyond Standard Model searches with neutrino\\ninteractions. In particular, it will have access to unprecedented statistics of\\ntau and anti-tau neutrinos. The construction plan foresees commissioning of the\\nfacility and detector, and start of operation in advance of Long Shutdown 4,\\nwith a programme of exploration for 15 years of data taking. By exploring\\nunique regions of parameter space for feebly interacting particles in the\\nGeV/c$^2$ mass range, the SHiP experiment will complement ongoing searches at\\nthe LHC and searches at future colliders.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:53:20Z\"}"}
