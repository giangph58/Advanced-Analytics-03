Consequently, the computational\\ncost associated with this technique is much lower compared to standard SVD.\\nAdditionally, for the analysis of full n-dimensional datasets, the method\\nreduces data dimensionality by selecting a strategically reduced number of\\npoints from the original dataset through optimal sensor placement or uniform\\nsampling before performing SVD. Moreover, the properties of data assimilation\\nof heterogeneous databases of this method are illustrated using two distinct\\nreactive flow test cases: a numerical database modeling an axisymmetric,\\ntime-varying laminar coflow flame with a fuel mixture of 65% methane and 35%\\nnitrogen, using air as the oxidizer, and experimental data generated from a\\nturbulent bluff-body-stabilized hydrogen flame. The computational speed-up and\\nmemory gains associated with the lcSVD algorithm compared to SVD can reach\\nvalues larger than 10, with compression factors greater than 2000. Applying\\nlcSVD for data assimilation to reconstruct the flow dynamics combining data\\nfrom sensors with simulation measurements, we found errors smaller than 1% in\\nthe most relevant species modelling the flow.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:24:03Z\"}"}
