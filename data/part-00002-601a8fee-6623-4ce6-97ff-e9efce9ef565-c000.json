{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06175v1\", \"title\": \"Basic distillation with realistic noise\", \"summary\": \"Entanglement distillation is a key component of modular quantum computing and\\nlong-range quantum communications. However, this powerful tool to reduce noise\\nin entangled states is difficult to realize in practice for two main reasons.\\nFirst, operations used to carry out distillation inject noise they seek to\\nremove. Second, the extent to which distillation can work under realistic\\ndevice noise is less well-studied. In this work, we both simulate distillation\\nusing a variety of device noise models and perform distillation experiments on\\nfixed-frequency IBM devices. We find reasonable agreement between experimental\\ndata and simulation done using Pauli and non-Pauli noise models. In our data we\\nfind broad improvement when the metric of success for distillation is to\\nimprove average Bell fidelity under effective global depolarizing noise, or\\nremove coherent errors, or improve the Bell fidelity of mildly degraded Bell\\npairs. We pave the way to obtain broad improvement from distillation under a\\nstricter, but practically relevant, metric: distill non-local Bell pairs with\\nhigher fidelity than possible to obtain with other available methods. Our\\nresults also help understand metrics and requirements for quantum devices to\\nuse entanglement distillation as a primitive for modular computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:18:53Z\"}"}
