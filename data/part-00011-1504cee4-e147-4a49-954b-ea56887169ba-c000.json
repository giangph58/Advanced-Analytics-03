The results are valid up to\\ndimension-six operators in the decomposition of the effective Higgs potential.\\nWithin the framework of the obtained Higgs alignment conditions, the\\npossibility of the existence of light scalars is discussed. Within the Minimal\\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) framework, four benchmark scenarios are\\nproposed. It is shown that two of them predict phenomenologically\\ndistinguishable CP-violating interactions of the Higgs boson $h_3$ with\\nup-fermions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:27:09Z\"}"}
