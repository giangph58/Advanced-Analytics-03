{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04862v1\", \"title\": \"GAMDTP: Dynamic Trajectory Prediction with Graph Attention Mamba Network\", \"summary\": \"Accurate motion prediction of traffic agents is crucial for the safety and\\nstability of autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a\\nnovel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction.\\nSpecifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate\\nmechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more\\nefficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the\\nhigh-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory\\ncoordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction\\nresults. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically\\nfusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including\\nproposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage\\nframeworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction\\nquality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the\\nArgoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art\\nperformance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:19:20Z\"}"}
