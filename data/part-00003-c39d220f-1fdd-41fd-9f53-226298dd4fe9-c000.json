However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing\\ncontroversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults.\\nPrevious measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to\\ndraw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of\\nstacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating\\nthat PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of\\nPL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six\\nspatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse\\nanisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine\\nsplitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be\\nVsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure\\nresolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication,\\npaving the way for various applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.comp-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:39:40Z\"}"}
