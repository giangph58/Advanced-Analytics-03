{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07041v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Storage Integrity in Adversarial Settings\", \"summary\": \"Storage integrity is essential to systems and applications that use untrusted\\nstorage (e.g., public clouds, end-user devices). However, known methods for\\nachieving storage integrity either suffer from high (and often prohibitive)\\noverheads or provide weak integrity guarantees. In this work, we demonstrate a\\nhybrid approach to storage integrity that simultaneously reduces overhead while\\nproviding strong integrity guarantees. Our system, partially asynchronous\\nintegrity checking (PAC), allows disk write commitments to be deferred while\\nstill providing guarantees around read integrity. PAC delivers a 5.5X\\nthroughput and latency improvement over the state of the art, and 85% of the\\nthroughput achieved by non-integrity-assuring approaches. In this way, we show\\nthat untrusted storage can be used for integrity-critical workloads without\\nmeaningfully sacrificing performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:58:22Z\"}"}
