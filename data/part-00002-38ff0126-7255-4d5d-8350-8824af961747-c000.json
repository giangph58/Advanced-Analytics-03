For a step distribution $\\\\mu$ with finite second moment, the\\npositively step-reinforced random walk with $p\\\\in [1/2,1)$ and the negatively\\nstep-reinforced random walk with $p\\\\in (0,1)$ converge to a normal distribution\\nunder suitable normalization. In this work, we obtain the rates of convergence\\nto normality for both cases under the assumption that $\\\\mu$ has a finite third\\nmoment. In the proofs, we establish a Berry-Esseen bound for general\\nfunctionals of independent random variables, utilize the randomly weighted sum\\nrepresentations of step-reinforced random walks, and apply special comparison\\narguments to quantify the Kolmogorov distance between a mixed normal\\ndistribution and its corresponding normal distribution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:35:20Z\"}"}
