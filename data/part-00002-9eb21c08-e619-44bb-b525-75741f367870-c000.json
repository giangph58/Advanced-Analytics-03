{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24088v1\", \"title\": \"A Plasticity-Aware Method for Continual Self-Supervised Learning in\\n  Remote Sensing\", \"summary\": \"Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) methods have gained increasing\\nattention in remote sensing (RS) due to their capability to learn new tasks\\nsequentially from continuous streams of unlabeled data.\\n  Existing CSSL methods, while learning new tasks, focus on preventing\\ncatastrophic forgetting. To this end, most of them use regularization\\nstrategies to retain knowledge of previous tasks. This reduces the model's\\nability to adapt to the data of new tasks (i.e., learning plasticity), which\\ncan degrade performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a\\nnovel CSSL method that aims to learn tasks sequentially, while achieving high\\nlearning plasticity. To this end, the proposed method uses a knowledge\\ndistillation strategy with an integrated decoupling mechanism. The decoupling\\nis achieved by first dividing the feature dimensions into task-common and\\ntask-specific parts. Then, the task-common features are forced to be correlated\\nto ensure memory stability while the task-specific features are forced to be\\nde-correlated facilitating the learning of new features. Experimental results\\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to CaSSLe, which is a\\nwidely used CSSL framework, with improvements of up to 1.12% in average\\naccuracy and 2.33% in intransigence in a task-incremental scenario, and 1.24%\\nin average accuracy and 2.01% in intransigence in a class-incremental scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:42:06Z\"}"}
