In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a\\nmobile CF-mMIMO network under a comprehensive throughput model and show that it\\nsuffers from large performance degradation due to the combined effect of\\nchannel aging and handover delay. To improve the performance of CF-mMIMO under\\nmobility, we propose a fairness-differentiated handover scheme. Our scheme\\ndifferentiates the handover policy for different users by their channel\\nconditions compared to a threshold based on Jain's fairness index, in order to\\nprioritize handovers for the poorly served users. We present an extensive\\nevaluation of the mobile throughput performance of our handover scheme with\\nrealistic urban network distributions and UE mobility patterns. Our results\\nshow that our scheme significantly outperforms the existing literature\\nbenchmarks when considering both channel aging and handover delay cost.\\nImportantly, the advantage of UE-centric over network-centric CF-mMIMO, of\\nuniformly good performance over the network, is uniquely preserved under\\nmobility by our handover scheme. We thus show that CF-mMIMO can be a feasible\\narchitecture for practical mobile networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:35:41Z\"}"}
