{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07085v1\", \"title\": \"Identifying Unknown Stochastic Dynamics via Finite expression methods\", \"summary\": \"Modeling stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is crucial for\\nunderstanding complex dynamical systems in various scientific fields. Recent\\nmethods often employ neural network-based models, which typically represent\\nSDEs through a combination of deterministic and stochastic terms. However,\\nthese models usually lack interpretability and have difficulty generalizing\\nbeyond their training domain. This paper introduces the Finite Expression\\nMethod (FEX), a symbolic learning approach designed to derive interpretable\\nmathematical representations of the deterministic component of SDEs. For the\\nstochastic component, we integrate FEX with advanced generative modeling\\ntechniques to provide a comprehensive representation of SDEs. The numerical\\nexperiments on linear, nonlinear, and multidimensional SDEs demonstrate that\\nFEX generalizes well beyond the training domain and delivers more accurate\\nlong-term predictions compared to neural network-based methods. The symbolic\\nexpressions identified by FEX not only improve prediction accuracy but also\\noffer valuable scientific insights into the underlying dynamics of the systems,\\npaving the way for new scientific discoveries.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:57:54Z\"}"}
