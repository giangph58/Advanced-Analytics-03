{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24041v1\", \"title\": \"Toward Anxiety-Reducing Pocket Robots for Children\", \"summary\": \"A common denominator for most therapy treatments for children who suffer from\\nan anxiety disorder is daily practice routines to learn techniques needed to\\novercome anxiety. However, applying those techniques while experiencing anxiety\\ncan be highly challenging. This paper presents the design, implementation, and\\npilot study of a tactile hand-held pocket robot AffectaPocket, designed to work\\nalongside therapy as a focus object to facilitate coping during an anxiety\\nattack. The robot does not require daily practice to be used, has a small form\\nfactor, and has been designed for children 7 to 12 years old. The pocket robot\\nworks by sensing when it is being held and attempts to shift the child's focus\\nby presenting them with a simple three-note rhythm-matching game. We conducted\\na pilot study of the pocket robot involving four children aged 7 to 10 years,\\nand then a main study with 18 children aged 6 to 8 years; neither study\\ninvolved children with anxiety. Both studies aimed to assess the reliability of\\nthe robot's sensor configuration, its design, and the effectiveness of the user\\ntutorial. The results indicate that the morphology and sensor setup performed\\nadequately and the tutorial process enabled the children to use the robot with\\nlittle practice. This work demonstrates that the presented pocket robot could\\nrepresent a step toward developing low-cost accessible technologies to help\\nchildren suffering from anxiety disorders.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:05:59Z\"}"}
