{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04981v1\", \"title\": \"DiCoTTA: Domain-invariant Learning for Continual Test-time Adaptation\", \"summary\": \"This paper studies continual test-time adaptation (CTTA), the task of\\nadapting a model to constantly changing unseen domains in testing while\\npreserving previously learned knowledge. Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on\\nadaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to\\narbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this\\nlimitation, we present a novel online domain-invariant learning framework for\\nCTTA, dubbed DiCoTTA. DiCoTTA aims to learn feature representation to be\\ninvariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing.\\nTo this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation\\nstrategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features without corrupting\\nsemantic contents, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm\\nfor effectively managing information from previous test domains. DiCoTTA\\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover,\\nit showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:09:18Z\"}"}
