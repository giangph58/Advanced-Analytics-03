{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01649v1\", \"title\": \"Modeling the Siege of Syracuse: Resources, strategy, and collapse\", \"summary\": \"The Siege of Syracuse ($214-212$ BC) was a decisive event in the Second Punic\\nWar, leading to the city's fall to Rome despite its formidable defenses,\\nincluding the war machines devised by Archimedes. In this work, we propose a\\nmathematical model to describe the dynamics of the siege, incorporating the\\ndepletion of resources, the decline of Syracuse's population, and the\\npersistence of the Roman army. Our analysis reveals the existence of a critical\\nthreshold $\\\\lambda_{c}$, which determines the outcome of the siege. This\\nthreshold marks a phase transition: if the effectiveness of Syracuse's\\ndefenses, represented by $\\\\lambda$, had exceeded $\\\\lambda_{c}$, the city could\\nhave withstood the Roman assault. However, since history records Syracuse's\\nfall, we conclude that $\\\\lambda < \\\\lambda_{c}$. This result provides a\\nquantitative framework to understand the inevitability of the city's conquest\\nand demonstrates how mathematical modeling can offer new insights into\\nhistorical military conflicts. We also explore different scenarios and assess\\nthe impact of key factors such as siege duration, supply constraints, and\\ndefensive capabilities. The results provide insight into how strategic elements\\ninfluenced the eventual fall of Syracuse and demonstrate the applicability of\\nmathematical modeling in historical military analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:59:21Z\"}"}
