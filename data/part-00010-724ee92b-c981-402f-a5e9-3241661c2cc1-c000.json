However, limited labeled data in pathological images\\nrestricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle\\nthis challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance\\nMigration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate\\nmore varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and\\ninternuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration\\nModule (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process\\nof nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an\\nInternuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear\\nspatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above,\\nIM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts\\nand internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks.\\nEvaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images\\ngenerated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation\\nperformance. Code will be made public later.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:29:31Z\"}"}
