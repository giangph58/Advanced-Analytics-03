{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24315v1\", \"title\": \"Multiscale Insights of Domain Unfolding in Fibrin Mechanical Response\", \"summary\": \"Fibrinogen, the monomeric unit of fibrin, the main constituent of blood clot,\\nhas a very complex structure. The fibrinogen builds the fibrin fiber and\\nnetwork through the half-staggered packing via knob-hole interaction and the\\n$\\\\alpha$C crosslinkers. Due to its rich structure, the elastic behavior also\\nshows a unique nature of very high stretchability and multiple regimes in\\nstress-strain behaviour, which is not yet fully understood. We develop an\\nUnfolding-incorporated Coarse-Grained Polymer (UCGP) model for fibrinogen to\\nstudy the effect of domain unfolding on the mechanical behavior of fibrin fiber\\nand network. Our model captures the stretching behavior of fibrinogen as\\nobserved in AFM and all-atom simulations. We further extend our model to fibrin\\nfiber to study the effect of molecular unfolding at the fiber and network\\nlevel. We anticipate that our model will be able to account for the nonlinear\\nmechanical behavior of crosslinked fibrin gel. It is possibly the first model\\nof this sort to consider the precise, controllable knowledge of the effects of\\ndomain unfolding in crosslinked proteins. This model can also be used to model\\nsystems that have sacrificial bonds.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:05:39Z\"}"}
