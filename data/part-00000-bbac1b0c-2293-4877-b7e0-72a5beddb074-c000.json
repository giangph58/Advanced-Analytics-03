These algorithms are defined by\\ncoupling two acceleration techniques -- induced transformations and contraction\\n-- in the setting of Shunji Ito's natural extension of the Farey tent map,\\nwhich generates `slow' continued fraction expansions. In addition to defining\\nnew algorithms, we also realise several existing continued fraction algorithms\\nin our unifying setting. In particular, we find regular continued fractions,\\nthe second-named author's $S$-expansions, and Nakada's parameterised family of\\n$\\\\alpha$-continued fractions for all $0<\\\\alpha\\\\le 1$ as examples of contracted\\nFarey expansions. Moreover, we give a new description of a planar natural\\nextension for each of the $\\\\alpha$-continued fraction transformations as an\\nexplicit induced transformation of Ito's natural extension.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:34:53Z\"}"}
