This work presents a new\\nalgorithm that improves multi-view multi-person pose estimation, focusing on\\nfast triangulation speeds and good generalization capabilities. The approach\\nextends to whole-body pose estimation, capturing details from facial\\nexpressions to finger movements across multiple individuals and viewpoints.\\nAdaptability to different settings is demonstrated through strong performance\\nacross unseen datasets and configurations. To support further progress in this\\nfield, all of this work is publicly accessible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:57:33Z\"}"}
