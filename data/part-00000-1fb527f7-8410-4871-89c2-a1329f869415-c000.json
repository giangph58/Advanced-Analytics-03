Reductive Lie groups provide the setting in which the\\nLie group structure is compatible with Riemannian structures, via the existence\\nof bi-invariant metrics. This structure allows for the explicit construction of\\nRiemannian Brownian motion via symplectic techniques, which permits the study\\nof Langevin diffusions with noise in the position coordinate as well as\\nLangevin diffusions with noise in both momentum and position.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:44:05Z\"}"}
