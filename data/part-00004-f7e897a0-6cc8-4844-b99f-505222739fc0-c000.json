{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02494v1\", \"title\": \"Semiconductor Wafer Map Defect Classification with Tiny Vision\\n  Transformers\", \"summary\": \"Semiconductor wafer defect classification is critical for ensuring high\\nprecision and yield in manufacturing. Traditional CNN-based models often\\nstruggle with class imbalances and recognition of the multiple overlapping\\ndefect types in wafer maps. To address these challenges, we propose ViT-Tiny, a\\nlightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) framework optimized for wafer defect\\nclassification. Trained on the WM-38k dataset. ViT-Tiny outperforms its\\nViT-Base counterpart and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MSF-Trans and\\nCNN-based architectures. Through extensive ablation studies, we determine that\\na patch size of 16 provides optimal performance. ViT-Tiny achieves an F1-score\\nof 98.4%, surpassing MSF-Trans by 2.94% in four-defect classification,\\nimproving recall by 2.86% in two-defect classification, and increasing\\nprecision by 3.13% in three-defect classification. Additionally, it\\ndemonstrates enhanced robustness under limited labeled data conditions, making\\nit a computationally efficient and reliable solution for real-world\\nsemiconductor defect detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:18:00Z\"}"}
