{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01575v1\", \"title\": \"Fully ergodic simulations using radial updates\", \"summary\": \"A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often\\nhindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers.\\nThese potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors\\nand can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we\\naddress this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative\\nMetropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields\\nwhich enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the\\nsampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the\\nalgorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic\\nHubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site\\nsystem to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that\\nthe radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while\\nsimultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:28:49Z\"}"}
