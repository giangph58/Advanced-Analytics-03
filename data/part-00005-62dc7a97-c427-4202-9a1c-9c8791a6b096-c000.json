Our model provides a bridge\\nbetween the structural causal model view of causal inference common in the\\ngraphical models literature with that of the latent factor model view common in\\nthe potential outcomes literature. We show how classic models for potential\\noutcomes and treatment assignments fit within our framework. We provide an\\nidentification argument for the average treatment effect, the average treatment\\neffect on the treated, and the average treatment effect on the untreated. For\\nany estimator that has a fast enough estimation error rate for a certain\\nnuisance parameter, we establish it is consistent for these various causal\\nparameters. We then show principal component regression is one such estimator\\nthat leads to consistent estimation, and we analyze the minimal smoothness\\nrequired of the potential outcomes function for consistency.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM,cs.LG,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:04:26Z\"}"}
