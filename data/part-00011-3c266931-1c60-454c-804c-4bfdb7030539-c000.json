We consider the two most important determinants in the\\nconstruction of the reference state for our ansatz. Furthermore, in order to\\ncarry out our intended 12-qubit computation on a noisy intermediate scale\\nquantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we\\nperform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of\\ntwo-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12515 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the\\nunoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of\\nsupercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy (with\\nerror mitigation and post-selection) relative to that computed classically for\\nthe same resource-optimized problem setting.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:52:37Z\"}"}
