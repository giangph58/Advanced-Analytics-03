{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02361v1\", \"title\": \"MG-Gen: Single Image to Motion Graphics Generation with Layer\\n  Decomposition\", \"summary\": \"General image-to-video generation methods often produce suboptimal animations\\nthat do not meet the requirements of animated graphics, as they lack active\\ntext motion and exhibit object distortion. Also, code-based animation\\ngeneration methods typically require layer-structured vector data which are\\noften not readily available for motion graphic generation. To address these\\nchallenges, we propose a novel framework named MG-Gen that reconstructs data in\\nvector format from a single raster image to extend the capabilities of\\ncode-based methods to enable motion graphics generation from a raster image in\\nthe framework of general image-to-video generation. MG-Gen first decomposes the\\ninput image into layer-wise elements, reconstructs them as HTML format data and\\nthen generates executable JavaScript code for the reconstructed HTML data. We\\nexperimentally confirm that \\\\ours{} generates motion graphics while preserving\\ntext readability and input consistency. These successful results indicate that\\ncombining layer decomposition and animation code generation is an effective\\nstrategy for motion graphics generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:52:12Z\"}"}

To address this challenge, paper recommendation systems have been\\ndeveloped to help researchers in effectively identifying relevant paper. One of\\nthe leading approaches to paper recommendation is content-based filtering\\nmethod. Traditional content-based filtering methods recommend relevant papers\\nto users based on the overall similarity of papers. However, these approaches\\ndo not take into account the information seeking behaviors that users commonly\\nemploy when searching for literature. Such behaviors include not only\\nevaluating the overall similarity among papers, but also focusing on specific\\nsections, such as the method section, to ensure that the approach aligns with\\nthe user's interests. In this paper, we propose a content-based filtering\\nrecommendation method that takes this information seeking behavior into\\naccount. Specifically, in addition to considering the overall content of a\\npaper, our approach also takes into account three specific sections\\n(background, method, and results) and assigns weights to them to better reflect\\nuser preferences. We conduct offline evaluations on the publicly available DBLP\\ndataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms six\\nbaseline methods in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, MRR, and MAP.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:11:58Z\"}"}
