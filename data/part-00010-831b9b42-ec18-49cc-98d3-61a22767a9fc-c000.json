However, many existing approaches prioritize image-level perceptual\\nquality, often neglecting alignment with downstream tasks, which can lead to\\nsuboptimal semantic representation. This paper introduces an Ultra-Low Bitrate\\nSemantic Communication (ULBSC) system that employs a conditional generative\\nmodel and a learnable condition codebook.By integrating saliency conditions and\\nimage-level semantic information, the proposed method enables\\nhigh-perceptual-quality and controllable task-oriented image transmission.\\nRecognizing shared patterns among objects, we propose a codebook-assisted\\ncondition transmission method, integrated with joint source-channel coding\\n(JSCC)-based text transmission to establish ULBSC. The codebook serves as a\\nknowledge base, reducing communication costs to achieve ultra-low bitrate while\\nenhancing robustness against noise and inaccuracies in saliency detection.\\nSimulation results indicate that, under ultra-low bitrate conditions with an\\naverage compression ratio of 0.57Z%o, the proposed system delivers superior\\nvisual quality compared to traditional JSCC techniques and achieves higher\\nsaliency similarity between the generated and source images compared to\\nstate-of-the-art generative semantic communication methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:05:19Z\"}"}
