In particular, we establish that the logarithm of\\nthe ratio of the $L^p$ norm to the $L^1$ norm decreases super-exponentially\\nfast during the initial phase, subsequently decaying to zero exponentially fast\\nin the latter phase. This implies that if the initial data is solely in $L^1$,\\nthen for $t>0$, the solution will belong to $L^p$ for any $p\\\\in [1,\\\\infty)$.\\nThe results are obtained under the assumption of a Poincar\\\\'e inequality.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:45:24Z\"}"}
