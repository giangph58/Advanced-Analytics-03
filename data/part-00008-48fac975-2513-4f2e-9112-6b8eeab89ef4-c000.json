{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24206v1\", \"title\": \"Synthetic News Generation for Fake News Classification\", \"summary\": \"This study explores the generation and evaluation of synthetic fake news\\nthrough fact based manipulations using large language models (LLMs). We\\nintroduce a novel methodology that extracts key facts from real articles,\\nmodifies them, and regenerates content to simulate fake news while maintaining\\ncoherence. To assess the quality of the generated content, we propose a set of\\nevaluation metrics coherence, dissimilarity, and correctness. The research also\\ninvestigates the application of synthetic data in fake news classification,\\ncomparing traditional machine learning models with transformer based models\\nsuch as BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer models, especially\\nBERT, effectively leverage synthetic data for fake news detection, showing\\nimprovements with smaller proportions of synthetic data. Additionally, we find\\nthat fact verification features, which focus on identifying factual\\ninconsistencies, provide the most promising results in distinguishing synthetic\\nfake news. The study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance fake\\nnews detection systems, offering valuable insights for future research and\\nsuggesting that targeted improvements in synthetic data generation can further\\nstrengthen detection models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:24:05Z\"}"}
