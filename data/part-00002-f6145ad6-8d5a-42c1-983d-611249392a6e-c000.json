While\\nstate-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation\\nto enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models,\\nthey suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to\\ninconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus\\nproblem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address\\nthis fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that\\nmitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in\\nthe score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that\\neliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant\\nview components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a\\nsimilarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the\\nunconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships.\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the\\nmulti-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing\\nmethods in both visual quality and consistency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:43:23Z\"}"}
