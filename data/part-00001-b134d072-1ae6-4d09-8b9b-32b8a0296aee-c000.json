{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06143v1\", \"title\": \"ARLO: A Tailorable Approach for Transforming Natural Language Software\\n  Requirements into Architecture using LLMs\", \"summary\": \"Software requirements expressed in natural language (NL) frequently suffer\\nfrom verbosity, ambiguity, and inconsistency. This creates a range of\\nchallenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and\\nassessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to\\naccomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is\\ntime-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that\\nautomates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system,\\n(2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software\\nquality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM).\\nSpecifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system\\nthat is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of\\narchitectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the\\narchitectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the\\ncurrent requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world\\nexamples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural\\nchoices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a\\nparticular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the\\nidentification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative\\narchitectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed\\ntherein.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:38:42Z\"}"}
