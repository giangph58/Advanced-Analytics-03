Our calculations primarily\\nfocus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the\\nground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial\\nexcited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the\\nresidues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their\\npossible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve\\nhigher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative\\noperators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in\\ntwo distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\\\\mathrm{\\\\overline{MS}}$.\\nGiven the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results\\nwith previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies\\nemploying various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for\\nexperimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:29:10Z\"}"}
