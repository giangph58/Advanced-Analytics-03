{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07903v1\", \"title\": \"Spectral delineation of Markov Generators: Classical vs Quantum\", \"summary\": \"The celebrated theorem of Perron and Frobenius implies that spectra of\\nclassical Markov operators, represented by stochastic matrices, are restricted\\nto the unit disk. This property holds also for spectra of quantum stochastic\\nmaps (quantum channels), which describe quantum Markovian evolution in discrete\\ntime. Moreover, the spectra of stochastic $N \\\\times N$ matrices are\\nadditionally restricted to a subset of the unit disk, called Karpelevi\\\\u{c}\\nregion, the shape of which depends on $N$. We address the question of whether\\nthe spectra of generators, which induce Markovian evolution in continuous time,\\ncan be bound in a similar way. We propose a rescaling that allows us to answer\\nthis question affirmatively. The eigenvalues of the rescaled classical\\ngenerators are confined to the modified Karpelevi\\\\u{c} regions, whereas the\\neigenvalues of the rescaled quantum generators fill the entire unit disk.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:26:10Z\"}"}
