One particular intriguing possibility\\nis that flat Chern bands can, in principle, support exotic superconducting\\nphases together with fractional topological phases. Here, we report the\\nobservation of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, the\\nreentrant quantum anomalous Hall effect, and superconductivity within the first\\nmoir\\\\'e Chern band of twisted bilayer MoTe2. The superconducting phase emerges\\nfrom a normal state exhibiting anomalous Hall effects and sustains an large\\nperpendicular critical magnetic field. Our results present the first example of\\nsuperconductivity emerging within a flat Chern band that simultaneously hosts\\nfractional quantum anomalous effects, a phenomenon never observed in any other\\nsystems. Our work expands the understanding of emergent quantum phenomena in\\nmoir\\\\'e Chern bands, and offers a nearly ideal platform for engineering\\nMajorana and parafermion zero modes in gate-controlled hybrid devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:27:56Z\"}"}
