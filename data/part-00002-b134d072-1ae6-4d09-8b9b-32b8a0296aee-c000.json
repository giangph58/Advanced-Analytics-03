While large-scale text-to-image\\n(T2I) models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have demonstrated\\nimpressive generation quality, they often suffer from style misalignment across\\ngenerated image sets and slow inference speeds, limiting their practical\\nusability. To address these issues, we propose three key components: initial\\nfeature replacement to ensure consistent background appearance, pivotal feature\\ninterpolation to align object placement, and dynamic style injection, which\\nreinforces style consistency using a schedule function. Unlike previous methods\\nrequiring fine-tuning or additional training, our approach maintains fast\\ninference while preserving individual content details. Extensive experiments\\nshow that our method achieves generation quality comparable to competing\\napproaches, significantly improves style alignment, and delivers inference\\nspeeds over six times faster than the fastest model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:39:25Z\"}"}
