{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24189v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum superalgebras and the free-fermionic Yang-Baxter equation\", \"summary\": \"The free-fermion point refers to a\\n$\\\\operatorname{GL}(2)\\\\times\\\\operatorname{GL}(1)$ parametrized Yang-Baxter\\nequation within the six-vertex model. It has been known for a long time that\\nthis is connected with the quantum group $U_q(\\\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$. We\\ndemonstrate that $R$-matrices from the finite quantum superalgebra\\n$U_q(\\\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ recovers a dense subset of the free-fermion point of\\nthe six-vertex model and recover the prime, simple modules in the affine\\nquantum superalgebra $U_q(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak{gl}}(1|1))$. Either of these\\nquantum groups can be used to generate the full free-fermion point, and we\\ndiscuss them both. Our discussion includes 6 families of six-vertex models used\\nby Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg in connection with Tokuyama's theorem, a\\ndeformation of the Weyl character formula. Thus our work gives quantum group\\ninterpretations for those models, known informally as Tokuyama ice.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:06:50Z\"}"}
