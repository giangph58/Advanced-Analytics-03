The\\ndwarf novae RU Pegasi, V426 Ophiuchi and IP Pegasi were detected during\\noutburst at L-band (1284 MHz central frequency). Previously, only one\\ncataclysmic variable was radio-detected at a frequency this low. We now bring\\nthe number to four. With these three newly found radio-emitters, the population\\nof dwarf novae confirmed to be radio-emitting at any frequency reaches 10\\nsystems. We found that the radio luminosity is correlated with the optical\\nluminosity. For V426 Ophiuchi and RU Pegasi we found a radio decline\\ncontemporary with the outburst's optical decline. The peak radio luminosity of\\ndwarf novae in outburst is very similar to that of novalike Cataclysmic\\nVariables and no correlation with orbital period is seen.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:33:42Z\"}"}
