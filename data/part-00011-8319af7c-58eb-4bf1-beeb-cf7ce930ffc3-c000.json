The particle is\\nmodeled by scaled solitons to a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations and\\nthe nonlinear interaction between the charged particle and the electromagnetic\\nfield is governed by the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system. We show that when the\\nsize and amplitude of the particle are sufficiently small, the solution to the\\ncoupled nonlinear system exists up to any given time and the energy of the\\nparticle concentrates along a straight line. The method relies on the\\nmodulation approach for the study of stability for solitons and weighted energy\\nestimates for the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:22:27Z\"}"}
