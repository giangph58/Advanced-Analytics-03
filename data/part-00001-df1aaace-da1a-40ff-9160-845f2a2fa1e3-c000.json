{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02680v1\", \"title\": \"The role of hydrodynamics in the synchronisation of {\\\\it Chlamydomonas}\\n  flagella\", \"summary\": \"While hydrodynamic coupling has long been considered essential for\\nsynchronisation of eukaryotic flagella, recent experiments on the unicellular\\nbiflagellate model organism {\\\\it Chlamydomonas} demonstrate that -- at the\\nsingle cell level -- intracellular mechanical coupling is necessary for\\ncoordination. It is therefore unclear what role, if any, hydrodynamic forces\\nactually play in the synchronisation of multiple flagella within individual\\ncells, arguably the building block of large scale coordination. Here we address\\nthis question experimentally by transiently blocking hydrodynamic coupling\\nbetween the two flagella of single {\\\\it Chlamydomonas}. Our results reveal that\\nin wild type cells intracellularly-mediated forces are necessary and sufficient\\nfor flagellar synchronisation, with hydrodynamic coupling causing minimal\\nchanges in flagellar dynamics. However, fluid-mediated ciliary coupling is\\nresponsible for the extended periods of anti-phase synchronisation observed in\\na mutant with weaker intracellular coupling. At the single-cell level,\\ntherefore, flagellar coordination depends on a subtle balance between\\nintracellular and extracellular forces.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph,q-bio.CB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:48Z\"}"}
