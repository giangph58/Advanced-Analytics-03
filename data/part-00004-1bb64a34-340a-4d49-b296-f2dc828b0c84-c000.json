We propose Multi-Level Sentiment Analysis\\nbased on pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a\\nnovel framework that systematically integrates firm-specific micro-level\\nsentiment, industry-specific meso-level sentiment, and duration-aware smoothing\\nto model the latency and persistence of textual impact. Applying our framework\\nto the comprehensive Chinese bond market corpus constructed by us (2013-2023,\\n1.39M texts), we extracted a daily composite sentiment index. Empirical results\\nshow statistically measurable improvements in credit spread forecasting when\\nincorporating sentiment (3.25% MAE and 10.96% MAPE reduction), with sentiment\\nshifts closely correlating with major social risk events and firm-specific\\ncrises. This framework provides a more nuanced understanding of sentiment\\nacross different market levels while accounting for the temporal evolution of\\nsentiment effects.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:35:07Z\"}"}
