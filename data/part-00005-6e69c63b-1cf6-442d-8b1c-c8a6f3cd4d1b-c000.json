However, existing studies\\non this topic are limited, as they primarily rely on small-scale experiments\\nwith human participants - a fundamental constraint of human subject studies. To\\naddress this limitation, we employ AI agents to simulate a large number of\\ncomplex data exploration scenarios, including revisiting past states and\\nbranching into new exploration paths. This strategy enables us to accurately\\nassess the impact of checkpointing while closely mimicking the behavior of\\nreal-world data practitioners. Our evaluation results, involving more than\\n1,000 exploration paths and 2,848 executed code blocks, show that a\\ncheckpointing framework for computational notebooks can indeed enhance\\nproductivity by minimizing unnecessary code re-executions and redundant\\nvariables or code.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:41:12Z\"}"}
