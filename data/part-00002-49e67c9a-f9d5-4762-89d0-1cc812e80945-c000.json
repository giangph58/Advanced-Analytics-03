In particular, we build upon our prior work on\\ncooperative localization between an aerial drone and ground robot that fuses\\ndata from LiDAR, inertial navigation, peer-to-peer ranging, altimeter, and\\nstereo-vision and evaluate the incorporation knowledge from the autopilot\\nregarding when the drone is hovering. This control command data is leveraged to\\nadd constraints on the velocity state. Hover constraints can be considered\\nimportant dynamic model information, such as the exploitation of zero-velocity\\nupdates in pedestrian navigation. We analyze the benefits of these constraints\\nusing an incremental factor graph optimization. Experimental data collected in\\na motion capture faculty is used to provide performance insights and assess the\\nbenefits of hover constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:23:30Z\"}"}
