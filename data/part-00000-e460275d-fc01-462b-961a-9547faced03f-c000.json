However, our vision of the Sun is still incomplete, as\\nillustrated by the current debate on its chemical composition. The problem\\nreaches far beyond chemical abundances and is intimately linked to microscopic\\nand macroscopic physical ingredients of solar models such as radiative opacity,\\nfor which experimental results have been recently measured that still await\\ntheoretical explanations. We present opacity profiles derived from helioseismic\\ninferences and compare them with detailed theoretical computations of\\nindividual element contributions using three different opacity computation\\ncodes, in a complementary way to experimental results. We find that our seismic\\nopacity is about 10% higher than theoretical values used in current solar\\nmodels around 2 million degrees, but lower by 35% than some recent available\\ntheoretical values. Using the Sun as a laboratory of fundamental physics, we\\nshow that quantitative comparisons between various opacity tables are required\\nto understand the origin of the discrepancies between reported helioseismic,\\ntheoretical and experimental opacity values.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:51:42Z\"}"}
