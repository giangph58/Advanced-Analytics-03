However, current methods often generate low-quality\\ntextures and inconsistent 3D structures. This is especially true when\\nextrapolating significantly beyond the field of view of the reference image. To\\naddress these challenges, we propose PanoDreamer, a novel framework for\\nconsistent, 3D scene generation with flexible text and image control. Our\\napproach employs a large language model and a warp-refine pipeline, first\\ngenerating an initial set of images and then compositing them into a 360-degree\\npanorama. This panorama is then lifted into 3D to form an initial point cloud.\\nWe then use several approaches to generate additional images, from different\\nviewpoints, that are consistent with the initial point cloud and expand/refine\\nthe initial point cloud. Given the resulting set of images, we utilize 3D\\nGaussian Splatting to create the final 3D scene, which can then be rendered\\nfrom different viewpoints. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nPanoDreamer in generating high-quality, geometrically consistent 3D scenes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:57:01Z\"}"}
