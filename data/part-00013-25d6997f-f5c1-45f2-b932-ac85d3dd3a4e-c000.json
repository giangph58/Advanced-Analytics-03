{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06081v1\", \"title\": \"On the interference of the scattered wave and the incident wave in light\\n  scattering problems with Gaussian beams\", \"summary\": \"We consider the light scattering problem for a Gaussian beam and a\\n(spherical) particle at arbitrary location. Within the beam cross section, the\\ntotal electromagnetic field is the superposition of the incident beam and the\\nscattered wave. Using the Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory (GLMT) as a vehicle to\\naccess such scattering problems, we discuss the mathematical modeling of this\\ninterference at short, large but finite and infinite distances from the\\nscatterer. We show how to eliminate the errors that can arise from improper\\nmodeling in the most straight-forward manner, that is superimposing the\\nscattered wave with the closed-form expression for the Gaussian beam at a\\nfinite distance from the particle. GLMT uses a low order beam model ($s^1$),\\nbut using the known higher order models ($s^3$, $s^5$, $s^7$, ...) would not\\nmitigate these errors as we discuss. The challenge lies in an appropriate\\ndescription of the Gaussian beam at arbitrary distances from its focus, not in\\nits description on the scale of a particle (located in or near the focus) nor\\nin the expressions for the scattered field. Hence, the solutions described here\\ncan readily be extended to light scattering frameworks other than GLMT and are\\nthus also relevant for non-spherical particles.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:20:57Z\"}"}
