However, simulation\\ncan be resource-consuming, especially when High-Fidelity Simulators (HFS) are\\nused. To optimise simulation resources, we propose a pseudo-random test\\ngenerator that uses a Low-Fidelity Simulator (LFS) to estimate UAV flight\\npaths. This work simplifies the PX4 autopilot HFS to develop a LFS, which\\noperates one order of magnitude faster than the HFS.Test cases predicted to\\ncause safety violations in the LFS are subsequently validated using the HFS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:50:46Z\"}"}
