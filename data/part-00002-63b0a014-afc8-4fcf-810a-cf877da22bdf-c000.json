Its framework provides fast and high-fidelity rendering. Although\\nless complex than other solutions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), there\\nare still some challenges building smaller models without sacrificing quality.\\nIn this study, we perform a careful analysis of 3DGS training process and\\npropose a new optimization methodology. Our Better Optimized Gaussian Splatting\\n(BOGausS) solution is able to generate models up to ten times lighter than the\\noriginal 3DGS with no quality degradation, thus significantly boosting the\\nperformance of Gaussian Splatting compared to the state of the art.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:49:23Z\"}"}
