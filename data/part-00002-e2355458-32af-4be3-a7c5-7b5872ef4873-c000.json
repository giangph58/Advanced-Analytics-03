{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05977v1\", \"title\": \"Diffusion Based Ambiguous Image Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Medical image segmentation often involves inherent uncertainty due to\\nvariations in expert annotations. Capturing this uncertainty is an important\\ngoal and previous works have used various generative image models for the\\npurpose of representing the full distribution of plausible expert ground\\ntruths. In this work, we explore the design space of diffusion models for\\ngenerative segmentation, investigating the impact of noise schedules,\\nprediction types, and loss weightings. Notably, we find that making the noise\\nschedule harder with input scaling significantly improves performance. We\\nconclude that x- and v-prediction outperform epsilon-prediction, likely because\\nthe diffusion process is in the discrete segmentation domain. Many loss\\nweightings achieve similar performance as long as they give enough weight to\\nthe end of the diffusion process. We base our experiments on the LIDC-IDRI lung\\nlesion dataset and obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, we\\nintroduce a randomly cropped variant of the LIDC-IDRI dataset that is better\\nsuited for uncertainty in image segmentation. Our model also achieves SOTA in\\nthis harder setting.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:33:26Z\"}"}
