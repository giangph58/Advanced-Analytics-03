This phenomenon is well-known under a normal prior\\nand normal noise, where less precise signals yield posterior means closer to\\nthe prior mean. We show this effect extends to any symmetric, log-concave prior\\nand any symmetric, quasi-concave location experiment, using a newly introduced\\nprecision order. Our main result is that for any such prior and any signal\\nrealization, the posterior mean under location experiment S is closer to the\\nprior mean than is the posterior mean S', if and only if S is less precise than\\nS'. We discuss applications to cognitive imprecision, prior precision, and\\noverconfidence.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:09:04Z\"}"}
