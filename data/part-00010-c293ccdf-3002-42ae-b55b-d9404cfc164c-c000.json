{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05047v1\", \"title\": \"Debate Only When Necessary: Adaptive Multiagent Collaboration for\\n  Efficient LLM Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Multiagent collaboration has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing\\nthe reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While this approach\\nimproves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due\\nto iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries\\nthat do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation.\\nTo address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an\\nadaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate\\nprocess based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For\\nqueries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses\\nfrom participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while\\nmaintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate\\nsystems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation\\nand enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results\\nestablish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective\\nmultiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based\\ncollaboration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:17:52Z\"}"}
