One\\npopular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism\\nknown as a dispute game for block proposals. In these systems, validators can\\nchallenge blocks that they believe contain errors, and a successful challenge\\nresults in the transfer of a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward. In\\nthis paper, we reveal a structural vulnerability in the mechanism: validators\\nmay not be awarded a proper profit despite winning a dispute challenge. We\\ndevelop a formal game-theoretic model of the dispute game and analyze several\\nscenarios, including cases where the proposer controls some validators and\\ncases where a secondary auction mechanism is deployed to induce additional\\nparticipation. Our analysis demonstrates that under current designs, the\\ncompetitive pressure from validators may be insufficient to deter malicious\\nbehavior. We find that increased validator competition, paradoxically driven by\\nhigher rewards or participation, can allow a malicious proposer to\\nsignificantly lower their net loss by capturing value through mechanisms like\\nauctions. To address this, we propose countermeasures such as an escrowed\\nreward mechanism and a commit-reveal protocol. Our findings provide critical\\ninsights into enhancing the economic security of layer-2 scaling solutions in\\nblockchain networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:00:46Z\"}"}
