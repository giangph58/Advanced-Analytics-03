We performed a\\nstate-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation using the gauge ensembles produced by\\nthe Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with dynamical light, strange\\nand charm quarks with physical masses and employed the so-called\\nHansen-Lupo-Tantalo (HLT) method to extract the decay rate and the first two\\nlepton-energy moments from the relevant Euclidean correlators. We have\\ncarefully taken into account all sources of systematic errors, including the\\nones associated with the continuum and infinite-volume extrapolations and with\\nthe HLT spectral reconstruction method. We obtained results in very good\\nagreement with the currently available experimental determinations and with a\\ntotal accuracy at the few-percent level, of the same order of magnitude of the\\nexperimental error. Our total error is dominated by the lattice QCD simulations\\nstatistical uncertainties and is certainly improvable. From the results\\npresented and thoroughly discussed in this paper we conclude that it is\\nnowadays possible to study heavy mesons inclusive semileptonic decays on the\\nlattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy. The\\nphenomenological implications of our physical results are the subject of a\\ncompanion letter [1].\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:07:58Z\"}"}
