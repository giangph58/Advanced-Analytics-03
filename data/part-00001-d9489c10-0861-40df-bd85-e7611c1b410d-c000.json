{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01733v1\", \"title\": \"Epistemic Skills: Reasoning about Knowledge and Oblivion\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a class of epistemic logics that captures the dynamics of\\nacquiring knowledge and descending into oblivion, while incorporating concepts\\nof group knowledge. The approach is grounded in a system of weighted models,\\nintroducing an ``epistemic skills'' metric to represent the epistemic\\ncapacities tied to knowledge updates. Within this framework, knowledge\\nacquisition is modeled as a process of upskilling, whereas oblivion is\\nrepresented as a consequence of downskilling. The framework further enables\\nexploration of ``knowability'' and ``forgettability,'' defined as the potential\\nto gain knowledge through upskilling and to lapse into oblivion through\\ndownskilling, respectively. Additionally, it supports a detailed analysis of\\nthe distinctions between epistemic de re and de dicto expressions. The\\ncomputational complexity of the model checking and satisfiability problems is\\nexamined, offering insights into their theoretical foundations and practical\\nimplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CC,cs.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:41:42Z\"}"}
