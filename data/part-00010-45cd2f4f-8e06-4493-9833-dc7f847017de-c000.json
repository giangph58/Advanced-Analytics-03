{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04878v1\", \"title\": \"Analysis and Computation of Geodesic Distances on Reductive Homogeneous\\n  Spaces\", \"summary\": \"Many geometric machine learning and image analysis applications, require a\\nleft-invariant metric on the 5D homogeneous space of 3D positions and\\norientations SE(3)/SO(2). This is done in Equivariant Neural Networks (G-CNNs),\\nor in PDE-Based Group Convolutional Neural Networks (PDE-G-CNNs), where the\\nRiemannian metric enters in multilayer perceptrons, message passing, and\\nmax-pooling over Riemannian balls.\\n  In PDE-G-CNNs it is proposed to take the minimum left-invariant Riemannian\\ndistance over the fiber in SE(3)/SO(2), whereas in G-CNNs and in many geometric\\nimage processing methods an efficient SO(2)-conjugation invariant section is\\nadvocated.\\n  The conjecture rises whether that computationally much more efficient section\\nindeed always selects distance minimizers over the fibers. We show that this\\nconjecture does NOT hold in general, and in the logarithmic norm approximation\\nsetting used in practice we analyze the small (and sometimes vanishing)\\ndifferences. We first prove that the minimal distance section is reached by\\nminimal horizontal geodesics with constant momentum and zero acceleration along\\nthe fibers, and we generalize this result to (reductive) homogeneous spaces\\nwith legal metrics and commutative structure groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:41:12Z\"}"}
