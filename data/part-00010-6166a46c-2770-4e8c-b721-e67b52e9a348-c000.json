{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24184v1\", \"title\": \"Investigation of Tearing Mode Stability Near Ideal Stability Boundaries\\n  Via Asymptotic Matching Techniques\", \"summary\": \"A number of improvements to the TJ toroidal tearing mode code [Phys. Plasmas\\n31, 102507 (2024)] are documented. The TJ code is also successfully benchmarked\\nagainst the STRIDE toroidal tearing mode code [Phys. Plasmas 25, 082502\\n(2018)]. Finally, the new capabilities of the TJ code are used to investigate\\nthe stability of tearing modes in tokamak plasmas as an ideal stability\\nboundary, associated with either an external-kink or an internal-kink mode, is\\napproached. All elements of the tearing stability matrix are found to tend to\\ninfinity as an ideal stability boundary is approached. Furthermore, as the\\nstability boundary is approached, the eigenfunctions of the various tearing\\nmodes in the plasma, which are decoupled by sheared plasma rotation, are all\\nfound to morph into that of the marginally-stable ideal mode. However, the\\ngrowth-rates and real frequencies of the various ``ideal-tearing-modes'' are\\ndifferent from one another. Moreover, the growth-rate of the ideal-tearing-mode\\nthat reconnects magnetic flux at the rational surface that lies closest to the\\nedge of the plasma is the one that tends to a very large value as the stability\\nboundary is approached. A relatively simple test for ideal stability that is\\ncapable of detecting stability boundaries for external-kink and internal-kink\\nmodes, even in the presence of a very close-fitting ideal wall, is described\\nand verified.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:01:13Z\"}"}
