{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01679v1\", \"title\": \"Self-Discharging Mitigated Quantum Battery\", \"summary\": \"As a quantum thermodynamic device that utilizes quantum systems for energy\\nstorage and delivery, the quantum battery (QB) is expected to offer\\nrevolutionary advantages in terms of increasing the charging power and the\\nextractable work by using quantum resources. However, the ubiquitous\\ndecoherence in the microscopic world inevitably forces the QB to spontaneously\\nlose its stored energy. This is called the self-discharging of the QB and\\nseverely limits its realization. We propose a QB scheme based on the\\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, where the electronic spin serves as\\nthe QB. Inspired by our finding that the coherent ergotropy decays more slowly\\nthan the incoherent ergotropy, we reveal a mechanism to enhance the inherent\\nrobustness of the QB to the self-discharging by improving the ratio of coherent\\nergotropy to total ergotropy. The unique hyperfine interaction between the\\nelectron and the native $^{14}$N nucleus in our scheme allows to coherently\\noptimize this ratio. Enriching the understanding on the extractable work of the\\nQB, our results pave the way for the practical realization of the QB.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:26:42Z\"}"}
