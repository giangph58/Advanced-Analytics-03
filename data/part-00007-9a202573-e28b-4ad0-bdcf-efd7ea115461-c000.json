{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07428v1\", \"title\": \"Task-oriented Age of Information for Remote Inference with Hybrid\\n  Language Models\", \"summary\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial\\nintelligence (AI) through their advanced reasoning capabilities, but their\\nextensive parameter sets introduce significant inference latency, posing a\\nchallenge to ensure the timeliness of inference results. While Small Language\\nModels (SLMs) offer faster inference speeds with fewer parameters, they often\\ncompromise accuracy on complex tasks. This study proposes a novel remote\\ninference system comprising a user, a sensor, and an edge server that\\nintegrates both model types alongside a decision maker. The system dynamically\\ndetermines the resolution of images transmitted by the sensor and routes\\ninference tasks to either an SLM or LLM to optimize performance. The key\\nobjective is to minimize the Task-oriented Age of Information (TAoI) by jointly\\nconsidering the accuracy and timeliness of the inference task. Due to the\\nnon-uniform transmission time and inference time, we formulate this problem as\\na Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). By converting the SMDP to an equivalent\\nMarkov decision process, we prove that the optimal control policy follows a\\nthreshold-based structure. We further develop a relative policy iteration\\nalgorithm leveraging this threshold property. Simulation results demonstrate\\nthat our proposed optimal policy significantly outperforms baseline approaches\\nin managing the accuracy-timeliness trade-off.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.NI,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:48:09Z\"}"}
