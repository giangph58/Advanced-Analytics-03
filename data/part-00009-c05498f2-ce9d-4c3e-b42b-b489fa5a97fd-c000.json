{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05026v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-level Neural Networks for high-dimensional parametric obstacle\\n  problems\", \"summary\": \"A new method to solve computationally challenging (random) parametric\\nobstacle problems is developed and analyzed, where the parameters can influence\\nthe related partial differential equation (PDE) and determine the position and\\nsurface structure of the obstacle. As governing equation, a stationary elliptic\\ndiffusion problem is assumed. The high-dimensional solution of the obstacle\\nproblem is approximated by a specifically constructed convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN). This novel algorithm is inspired by a finite element constrained\\nmultigrid algorithm to represent the parameter to solution map. This has two\\nbenefits: First, it allows for efficient practical computations since\\nmulti-level data is used as an explicit output of the NN thanks to an\\nappropriate data preprocessing. This improves the efficacy of the training\\nprocess and subsequently leads to small errors in the natural energy norm.\\nSecond, the comparison of the CNN to a multigrid algorithm provides means to\\ncarry out a complete a priori convergence and complexity analysis of the\\nproposed NN architecture. Numerical experiments illustrate a state-of-the-art\\nperformance for this challenging problem.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.FA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:50:56Z\"}"}
