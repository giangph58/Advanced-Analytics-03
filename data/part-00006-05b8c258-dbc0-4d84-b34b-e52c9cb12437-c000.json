We develop an upper bound for the error between the two\\nevolutions that can be controlled through the step size of the Riemannian\\ngradient descent which minimizes the energy of the system. We discuss\\nimplementations through adaptive quantum algorithms and present a stochastic\\nRiemannian gradient descent algorithm in which each step is efficiently\\nimplementable on a quantum computer. We prove that for a sufficiently small\\nstep size, the stochastic evolution concentrates around the imaginary time\\nevolution, thereby providing performance guarantees for cooling the system\\nthrough stochastic Riemannian gradient descent.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:17:05Z\"}"}
