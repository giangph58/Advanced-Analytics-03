We employ both analytical and numerical methods in\\nthese analyses. In the case excluding all dissipation, the typical time scale\\nof convection is determined by the free fall time over the temperature scale\\nheight. We quantitatively show the condition for the Boussinesq and\\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximations to be applicable. We provide a\\nreassessment of the critical Rayleigh number, a key indicator of convection,\\nand show that WKB approximation tends to underestimate the critical Rayleigh\\nnumber, particularly when the temperature scale height is comparable to or\\nsmaller than the domain height. We show clear explanation why both thermal\\nconduction and viscosity are required for stabilizing negative entropy gradient\\nmedium.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:13:31Z\"}"}
