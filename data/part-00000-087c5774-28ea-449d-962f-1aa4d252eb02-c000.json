{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23952v1\", \"title\": \"HeteroPod: XPU-Accelerated Infrastructure Offloading for Commodity\\n  Cloud-Native Applications\", \"summary\": \"Cloud-native systems increasingly rely on infrastructure services (e.g.,\\nservice meshes, monitoring agents), which compete for resources with user\\napplications, degrading performance and scalability. We propose HeteroPod, a\\nnew abstraction that offloads these services to Data Processing Units (DPUs) to\\nenforce strict isolation while reducing host resource contention and\\noperational costs. To realize HeteroPod, we introduce HeteroNet, a cross-PU\\n(XPU) network system featuring: (1) split network namespace, a unified network\\nabstraction for processes spanning CPU and DPU, and (2) elastic and efficient\\nXPU networking, a communication mechanism achieving shared-memory performance\\nwithout pinned resource overhead and polling costs. By leveraging HeteroNet and\\nthe compositional nature of cloud-native workloads, HeteroPod can optimally\\noffload infrastructure containers to DPUs. We implement HeteroNet based on\\nLinux, and implement a cloud-native system called HeteroK8s based on\\nKubernetes. We evaluate the systems using NVIDIA Bluefield-2 DPUs and CXL-based\\nDPUs (simulated with real CXL memory devices). The results show that HeteroK8s\\neffectively supports complex (unmodified) commodity cloud-native applications\\n(up to 1 million LoC) and provides up to 31.9x better latency and 64x less\\nresource consumption (compared with kernel-bypass design), 60% better\\nend-to-end latency, and 55% higher scalability compared with SOTA systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.OS\", \"categories\": \"cs.OS\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:11:16Z\"}"}
