Conventional deep learning methods often rely\\non the nonlinear modeling capabilities of neural networks to establish mappings\\nbetween past and future states, overlooking the fluid dynamics, or only\\nmodeling the velocity field, neglecting the coupling of multiple physical\\nquantities. In this paper, we propose a new physics-informed learning approach\\nthat incorporates coupled physical quantities into the prediction process to\\nassist with forecasting. Central to our method lies in the discretization of\\nphysical equations, which are directly integrated into the model architecture\\nand loss function. This integration enables the model to provide robust,\\nlong-term future predictions. By incorporating physical equations, our model\\ndemonstrates temporal extrapolation and spatial generalization capabilities.\\nExperimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art\\nperformance in spatiotemporal prediction across both numerical simulations and\\nreal-world extreme-precipitation nowcasting benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:11:01Z\"}"}
