Still, key aspects of their adoption\\nsuch as languages support, ethics, and long-term impact on writers voice and\\ncreativity remain underexplored. In this work, we conducted a questionnaire (N\\n= 301) and an interactive survey (N = 36) targeting professional writers\\nregularly using AI. We examined LLM-assisted writing practices across 25+\\nlanguages, ethical concerns, and user expectations. The findings of the survey\\ndemonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs\\nadoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and\\nstyle adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide\\nfurther development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CY,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:35:17Z\"}"}
