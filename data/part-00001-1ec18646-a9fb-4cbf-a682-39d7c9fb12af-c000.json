In this work, we present a\\nstability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established\\ndislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model\\nand its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation\\ndensity model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of\\nsuch systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models\\ncan exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation\\ndensity. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences\\nmaterial hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena,\\nwe conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian\\ncrystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based\\nCP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale\\nmaterials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical\\ndevices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:07:19Z\"}"}
