We show how the theory extends to the overlap\\nvariables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting\\nexact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time,\\nthe spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random\\nbond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is\\nfound to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the\\nresults for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available\\nnumerical results.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.dis-nn,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:22:05Z\"}"}
