{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24227v1\", \"title\": \"Ambient and high pressure studies of structural, electronic and magnetic\\n  properties of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystal\", \"summary\": \"A thorough study of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystals, which were grown from Sn\\nflux, was performed using both bulk (heat capacity, ac susceptibility, dc\\nmagnetization, electrical resistivitivity, magnetoresistance) and microscopic\\n(M\\\\\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy) techniques. Electrical resistance and magnetic\\nsusceptibility were measured also under high pressure conditions (up to 19 GPa\\nand 9.5 GPa, respectively). Further insight into electronic properties and\\nphonons is provided by ab initio calculations. The results indicate that\\nEuZn$_2$P$_2$ is an antiferromagnet with strong Eu-Eu exchange coupling of\\nferromagnetic type within the basal plane and weaker antiferromagnetic\\ninteraction along the c axis. The Eu magnetic moments are tilted from the basal\\nplane. Hydrostatic pressure strongly affects both magnetic (increase of the\\nN\\\\'eel temperature) and electronic (suppression of the band gap and semi\\nmetallic behavior) properties, indicating a strong interplay of structure with\\nmagnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:40:30Z\"}"}
