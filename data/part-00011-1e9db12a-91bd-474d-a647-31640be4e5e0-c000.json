{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108v1\", \"title\": \"Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement\\n  Learning\", \"summary\": \"Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an\\noutstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring\\nsubstantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary\\nsearch with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the\\ndiscovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and\\noptimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator,\\nmissing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from\\nevolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based\\nevolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM -\\nthrough reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages\\nevolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms,\\nwhile RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments\\non three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman,\\nand the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search\\nimproves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential\\nof RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and\\nmathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:14:15Z\"}"}
