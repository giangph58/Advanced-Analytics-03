We analyze the clustering of galaxy clusters in a large contiguous\\nsample, the Constrain Dark Energy with X-ray (CODEX) sample. We construct a\\nlikelihood for cosmological parameters by comparing the measured clustering\\nsignal and a theoretical prediction, and use this to obtain parameter\\nconstraints. Methods. We measured the three multipole moments (monopole,\\nquadrupole, and hexadecapole, $\\\\ell = 0, 2, 4$) of the power spectrum of a\\nsubset of the CODEX clusters. To fully model cluster clustering, we also\\ndetermined the expected clustering bias of the sample using estimates for the\\ncluster masses and a mass-to-bias model calibrated using N-body simulations. We\\nestimated the covariance matrix of the measured power spectrum multipoles using\\na set of simulated dark-matter halo catalogs. Combining all these ingredients,\\nwe performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of cosmological parameters\\n$\\\\Omega_m$ and $\\\\sigma_8$ to obtain their posterior. Results. We found the\\nCODEX clustering signal to be consistent with an earlier X-ray selected cluster\\nsample, the REFLEX II sample. We also found that the measured power spectrum\\nmultipoles are compatible with the predicted, bias-scaled linear matter power\\nspectrum when the cosmological parameters determined by the Planck satellite\\nare assumed. Furthermore, we found the marginalized parameter constraints of\\n$\\\\Omega_m = 0.24^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ and $\\\\sigma_8 = 1.13^{+0.43}_{-0.24}$. The\\nfull 2D posterior is consistent, for example, with the Planck cosmology within\\nthe 68% confidence region.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:04:24Z\"}"}
