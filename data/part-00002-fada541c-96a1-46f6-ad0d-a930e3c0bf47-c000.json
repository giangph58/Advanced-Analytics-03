For these structures,\\nwhich we call blueprints, we provide a general framework for symbolic dynamics\\nunder a partial monoid action, and for transferring invariants of their\\nsymbolic dynamics through quasi-isometries. In particular, we show that the\\nundecidability of the domino problem, the existence of strongly aperiodic\\nsubshifts of finite type, and the existence of subshifts of finite type without\\ncomputable points are all quasi-isometry invariants for finitely presented\\nblueprints. As an application of this model, we show that a variant of the\\ndomino problem for geometric tilings of $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$ is undecidable for $d\\n\\\\geq 2$ on any underlying tiling space with finite local complexity.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.CO,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:43:02Z\"}"}
