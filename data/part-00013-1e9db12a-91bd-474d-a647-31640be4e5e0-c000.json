The stochastic description of physical systems based on stochastic\\nstorage models is associated with generalized Poisson (or shot) noise, in which\\nthe jump values can be quite large. Stochastic storage models have a direct\\nphysical meaning: some elements enter the system and leave it. Storage\\nprocesses fit into the general scheme of dynamic systems subject to the\\nadditive influence of a random process. The main relationships of storage\\nmodels are described, and the possibilities of applying the mathematical\\nprovisions of stochastic storage processes to various physical problems are\\nindicated. A number of examples of applying the stochastic storage model are\\nconsidered.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:15:18Z\"}"}
