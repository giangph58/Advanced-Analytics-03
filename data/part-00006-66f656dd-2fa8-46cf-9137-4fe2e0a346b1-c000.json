To this end, we present\\nSigChord, an efficient physical layer inspection system built on low-cost and\\nsub-Nyquist sampling radios. We first design a deep and rule-based interleaving\\nalgorithm based on Transformer network to perform spectrum sensing and signal\\nrecovery under sub-Nyquist sampling rate, and second, cascade protocol\\nidentifier and decoder based on Transformer neural networks to help physical\\nlayer packets analysis. We implement SigChord using software-defined radio\\nplatforms, and extensively evaluate it on over-the-air terrestrial and\\nnon-terrestrial wireless signals. The experiments demonstrate that SigChord\\ndelivers over 99% accuracy in detecting and decoding, while still decreasing\\n34% sampling rate, compared with the SOTA approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:32:39Z\"}"}
