{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07668v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Fault-Tolerant Control for Heterogeneous MAS with Prescribed\\n  Performance under Communication Failures\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel approach employing prescribed performance control\\nto address the distributed fault-tolerant formation control problem in a\\nheterogeneous UAV-UGV cooperative system under a directed interaction topology\\nand communication link failures. The proposed distributed fault-tolerant\\ncontrol scheme enables UAVs to accurately track a virtual leader's trajectory\\nand achieve the desired formation, while ensuring UGVs converge within the\\nconvex hull formed by leader UAVs. By accounting for differences in system\\nparameters and state dimensions between UAVs and UGVs, the method leverages\\nperformance functions to guarantee predefined transient and steady-state\\nbehavior. Additionally, a variable prescribed performance boundary control\\nstrategy with an adaptive learning rate is introduced to tackle actuator\\nsaturation, ensuring reliable formation tracking in real-world scenarios.\\nSimulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:40:40Z\"}"}
