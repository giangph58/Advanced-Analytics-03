Unlike the classical case, the kernel of the\\nStieltjes derivative operator is nontrivial, leading to non-uniqueness issues\\nin Cauchy problems. We characterize this kernel by providing necessary and\\nsufficient conditions for a function to have a zero Stieltjes derivative. To\\naddress the implications of this nontrivial kernel, we introduce a function\\nspace which serves as a suitable framework for studying Stieltjes differential\\nproblems. We explore its topological structure and propose a metric that\\nfacilitates the formulation of existence and uniqueness results. Our findings\\ndemonstrate that solutions to first-order Stieltjes differential equations are,\\nin general, not unique, underscoring the need for a refined analytical approach\\nto such problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:22:02Z\"}"}
