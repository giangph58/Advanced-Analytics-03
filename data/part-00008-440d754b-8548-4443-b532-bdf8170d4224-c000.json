{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06647v1\", \"title\": \"Uni-PrevPredMap: Extending PrevPredMap to a Unified Framework of\\n  Prior-Informed Modeling for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction\", \"summary\": \"Safety constitutes a foundational imperative for autonomous driving systems,\\nnecessitating the maximal incorporation of accessible external prior\\ninformation. This study establishes that temporal perception buffers and\\ncost-efficient maps inherently form complementary prior sources for online\\nvectorized high-definition (HD) map construction. We present Uni-PrevPredMap, a\\nunified prior-informed framework that systematically integrates two synergistic\\ninformation sources: previous predictions and simulated outdated HD maps. The\\nframework introduces two core innovations: a tile-indexed 3D vectorized global\\nmap processor enabling efficient refreshment, storage, and retrieval of 3D\\nvectorized priors; a tri-mode operational optimization paradigm ensuring\\nconsistency across prior-free, map-absent, and map-prior scenarios while\\nmitigating reliance on idealized map fidelity assumptions. Uni-PrevPredMap\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in map-free scenarios across established\\nonline vectorized HD map construction benchmarks. When provided with simulated\\noutdated HD maps, the framework exhibits robust capabilities in error-resilient\\nprior fusion, empirically confirming the synergistic complementarity between\\nprevious predictions and simulated outdated HD maps.
