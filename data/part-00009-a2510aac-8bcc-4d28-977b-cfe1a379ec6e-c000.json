The combination of AN and transmission beamforming vectors\\nis modeled as joint beamforming vector (JBV) to achieve optimal power\\nallocation. The objective is to maximize the achievable secrecy rate (SR) by\\noptimizing MAs antenna position, phase shift matrix (PSM) of RIS, and JBV. The\\nlimited movable range (MR) and discrete candidate positions of the MAs at the\\nBS are considered, which renders the optimization problem non-convex. To\\naddress these challenges, an optimization method under perfect channel state\\ninformation (CSI) is firstly designed, in which the MAs antenna positions are\\nobtained using compressive sensing (CS) technology, and JBV and PSM are\\niteratively optimized. Then, the design method and SR performance under\\nimperfect CSI is investigated. The proposed algorithms have fewer iterations\\nand lower complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that MAs outperform\\nfixed-position antennas in SR performance when there is an adequately large MR\\navailable.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:14:30Z\"}"}
