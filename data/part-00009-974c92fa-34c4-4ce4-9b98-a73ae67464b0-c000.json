{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01477v1\", \"title\": \"Online Timestamp-based Transactional Isolation Checking of Database\\n  Systems (Extended Version)\", \"summary\": \"Serializability (SER) and snapshot isolation (SI) are widely used\\ntransactional isolation levels in database systems. The isolation checking\\nproblem asks whether a given execution history of a database system satisfies a\\nspecified isolation level. However, existing SER and SI checkers, whether\\ntraditional black-box checkers or recent timestamp-based white-box ones,\\noperate offline and require the entire history to be available to construct a\\ndependency graph, making them unsuitable for continuous and ever-growing\\nhistories.\\n  This paper addresses online isolation checking by extending the\\ntimestamp-based isolation checking approach to online settings. Specifically,\\nwe design CHRONOS, an efficient timestamp-based offline SI checker. CHRONOS is\\nincremental and avoids constructing a start-ordered serialization graph for the\\nentire history, making it well-suited for online scenarios. We further extend\\nCHRONOS into an online SI checker, AION, addressing several key challenges\\nunique to online settings. Additionally, we develop AION-SER for online SER\\nchecking. Experiments highlight that CHRONOS processes offline histories with\\nup to one million transactions in seconds, greatly outperforming existing SI\\ncheckers. Furthermore, AION and AION-SER sustain a throughput of approximately\\n12K transactions per second, demonstrating their practicality for online\\nisolation checking.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:30:48Z\"}"}
