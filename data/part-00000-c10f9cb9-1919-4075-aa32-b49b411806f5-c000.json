Sectoral specialization plays\\na crucial role, as more concentrated FDI inflows lead to higher employment\\ngrowth. Furthermore, FDI-driven job creation exhibits significant spatial\\nspillover effects. However, regions attracting high-value FDI jobs, such as\\nthose in R&D and management, tend to experience slower overall employment\\ngrowth.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:21:51Z\"}"}
