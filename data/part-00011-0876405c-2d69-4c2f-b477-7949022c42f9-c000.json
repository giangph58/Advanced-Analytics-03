{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355v1\", \"title\": \"Modified cosmology though spacetime thermodynamics and generalized\\n  mass-to-horizon entropy\", \"summary\": \"In this work we apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach for the case of\\ngeneralized mass-to-horizon entropy, which is a two-parameter extension of\\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy that arises from the extended mass-to-horizon\\nrelation, that is in turn required in order to have consistency with the\\nClausius relation. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an\\neffective dark energy sector arising from the novel terms. We derive analytical\\nsolutions for the dark energy density parameter, the dark energy\\nequation-of-state parameter, and the deceleration parameter, and we show that\\nthe Universe exhibits the usual thermal history with the succession of matter\\nand dark energy epochs. Additionally, depending on the value of the entropy\\nparameters, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter can either lie in the\\nphantom regime at high redshifts entering into the quintessence regime at small\\nredshifts, or it can lie in the quintessence regime at high redshifts and\\nexperience the phantom-divide crossing at small redshifts, while in the far\\nfuture in all cases it asymptotically obtains the cosmological constant value\\n$-1$. Finally, we perform observational confrontation with Supernova Type Ia\\n(SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)\\ndatasets, showing that the scenario is in agreement with observations.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:35:35Z\"}"}
