{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01938v1\", \"title\": \"A Unified Approach to Analysis and Design of Denoising Markov Models\", \"summary\": \"Probabilistic generative models based on measure transport, such as diffusion\\nand flow-based models, are often formulated in the language of Markovian\\nstochastic dynamics, where the choice of the underlying process impacts both\\nalgorithmic design choices and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we aim to\\nestablish a rigorous mathematical foundation for denoising Markov models, a\\nbroad class of generative models that postulate a forward process transitioning\\nfrom the target distribution to a simple, easy-to-sample distribution,\\nalongside a backward process particularly constructed to enable efficient\\nsampling in the reverse direction. Leveraging deep connections with\\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics and generalized Doob's $h$-transform, we\\npropose a minimal set of assumptions that ensure: (1) explicit construction of\\nthe backward generator, (2) a unified variational objective directly minimizing\\nthe measure transport discrepancy, and (3) adaptations of the classical\\nscore-matching approach across diverse dynamics. Our framework unifies existing\\nformulations of continuous and discrete diffusion models, identifies the most\\ngeneral form of denoising Markov models under certain regularity assumptions on\\nforward generators, and provides a systematic recipe for designing denoising\\nMarkov models driven by arbitrary L\\\\'evy-type processes. We illustrate the\\nversatility and practical effectiveness of our approach through novel denoising\\nMarkov models employing geometric Brownian motion and jump processes as forward\\ndynamics, highlighting the framework's potential flexibility and capability in\\nmodeling complex distributions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:46:43Z\"}"}
