This,\\ntogether with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that\\nthe simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a\\nminimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients\\nin order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking\\narbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries,\\nwe argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should\\nbe added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation\\nprovides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very\\nnatural choices of dissipative terms.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:51:15Z\"}"}
