{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01660v1\", \"title\": \"STRAUSS: Sonification Tools & Resources for Analysis Using Sound\\n  Synthesis\", \"summary\": \"Sonification, or conveying data using non-verbal audio, is a relatively niche\\nbut growing approach for presenting data across multiple specialist domains\\nincluding astronomy, climate science, and beyond. The STRAUSS Python package\\naims to provide such a tool, which builds upon previous approaches to provide a\\npowerful means to explore different ways of expressing data, with fine control\\nover the output audio and its format. STRAUSS is a free, open source (FOSS)\\npackage, designed to allow flexible and effective sonification to be integrated\\ninto data workflows, in analogy to widely used visualisation packages. The\\nremit of STRAUSS is broad; it is intended to be able to bridge between ad-hoc\\nsolutions for sonifying very particular datasets, and highly technical\\ncompositional and sound-design tools that are not optimised for sonification,\\nor may have a steep learning curve. The code offers a range of approaches to\\nsonification for a variety of contexts (e.g. science education, science\\ncommunication, technical data analysis, etc). To this end, STRAUSS is packaged\\nwith a number of examples of different sonification approaches, and preset\\nconfigurations to support \\\"low-barrier, high-ceiling\\\" approach. STRAUSS has\\nbeen used to produce both educational resources and analysis tools.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:12:30Z\"}"}
