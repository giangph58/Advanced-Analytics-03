We prove that intrinsic\\nlocalization of an operator-valued frame is preserved by its canonical dual.\\nMoreover, we show that the series associated to the perfect reconstruction of\\nan operator-valued frame converges not only in the underlying Hilbert space,\\nbut also in a whole class of associated (quasi-)Banach spaces. Finally, we\\napply our results to irregular Gabor g-frames.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:49:54Z\"}"}
