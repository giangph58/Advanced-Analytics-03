Although it is very useful to reduce the computational\\nburden, it remains far from obvious whether it is actually satisfied in\\npractice. We propose a theoretical framework which aims at giving a precise\\nmeaning to the following question: how non-simplified or close to be simplified\\nis a given conditional copula? For this, we propose a theoretical framework\\ncentered at the notion of measure of non-constantness. Then we discuss\\ngeneralizations of the simplifying assumption to the case where the conditional\\nmarginal distributions may not be continuous, and corresponding measures of\\nnon-simplifyingness in this case. The simplifying assumption is of particular\\nimportance for vine copula models, and we therefore propose a notion of measure\\nof non-simplifyingness of a given copula for a particular vine structure, as\\nwell as different scores measuring how non-simplified such a vine\\ndecompositions would be for a general vine. Finally, we propose estimators for\\nthese measures of non-simplifyingness given an observed dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.OT,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:46:39Z\"}"}
