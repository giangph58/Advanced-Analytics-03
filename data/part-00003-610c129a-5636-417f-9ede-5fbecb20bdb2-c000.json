When the number\\n$g$ of distinct principal curvatures is greater than three, few satisfactory\\nresults have been known. We attack the conjecture in the Dupin hypersurface\\ncase. Our results are: A closed proper Dupin hypersurface with constant mean\\ncurvature is isoparametric (i) if $g=3$,\\n  (ii) if $g=4$ and has constant scalar curvature, or (iii) if $g=4$ and has\\nconstant Lie curvature, and\\n  (iv) if $g=6$ and has constant Lie curvatures. These cover all the\\nnon-trivial cases for a closed proper Dupin to be isoparametric since $g$ can\\ntake only values $1,2,3,4,6$. The originality of the proof is a use of topology\\nand geometry,\\n  which reduces assumptions needed in the algebraic argument.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:20:51Z\"}"}
