This letter addresses the graphical analysis of the frequency\\nresponse function, with the objective of enhancing the procedure for the\\nqualitative construction of Nyquist plots. Several results supported by\\nanalytical proofs are derived for what concerns the low and high frequency\\nbehavior, which enable to improve the qualitative construction of Nyquist plots\\nin the vicinity of the initial and final points.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:36:05Z\"}"}
