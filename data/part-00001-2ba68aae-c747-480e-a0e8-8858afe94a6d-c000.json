This work studies the moir\\\\'{e} physics of atoms within a spin-dependent\\ncubic lattice with relative twists along different directions. It is discovered\\nthat dimensionality significantly influences the low-energy moir\\\\'{e} physics.\\nFrom a geometric perspective, this manifests in the observation that moir\\\\'{e}\\npatterns, generated by rotating lattices along different axes, can exhibit\\neither periodic or quasi-periodic behavior--a feature not present in\\ntwo-dimensional systems. We develop a low-energy effective theory applicable to\\nsystems with arbitrary rotation axes and small rotation angles. This theory\\nelucidates the emergence of quasi-periodicity in three dimensions and\\ndemonstrates its correlation with the arithmetic properties of the rotation\\naxes. Numerical analyses reveal that these quasi-periodic moir\\\\'{e} potentials\\ncan lead to distinctive dimensional localization behaviors of atoms,\\nmanifesting as localized wave functions in planar or linear configurations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:38:03Z\"}"}
