For general networks\\nwith $M$ nodes, the optimal promotion is the solution of $2^M-1$\\nnonlinearly-coupled boundary-value problems. On structured networks, however,\\nthe number of equations can be reduced to a manageable size which is amendable\\nto simulations and analysis. This enables us to gain insight into the effect of\\nthe network structure on optimal promotions. We find that the optimal\\nadvertising strategy decreases with time, whereas the optimal boosting of peer\\neffects increases from zero and then decreases. In low-degree networks, it is\\noptimal to prioritize advertising over boosting peer effects, but this relation\\nis flipped in high-degree networks. When the planning horizon is finite, the\\noptimal promotion continues until the last minute, as opposed to an infinite\\nplanning horizon where the optimal promotion decays to zero. Finally,\\npromotions with short planning horizons can yield an order of magnitude higher\\nincrease of profits, compared to those with long planning horizons.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:23:10Z\"}"}
