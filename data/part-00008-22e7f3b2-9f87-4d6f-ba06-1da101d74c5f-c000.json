This work provides a comprehensive review of\\nuncertainty representations and categorizes them based on the dimensions used\\nto represent uncertainty. Through this categorization, key gaps and limitations\\nin existing approaches are identified. To address these issues, a Conceptual\\nModel of Uncertainty Representations in CPS is introduced, integrating and\\nextending existing models. Its applicability is demonstrated through examples\\nfrom the automotive domain, showing its effectiveness in capturing and\\nstructuring uncertainty in real-world scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:42:51Z\"}"}
