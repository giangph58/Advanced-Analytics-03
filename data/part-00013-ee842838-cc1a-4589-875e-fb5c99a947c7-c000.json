{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06862v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamics of critical cascades in interdependent networks\", \"summary\": \"The collapse of interdependent networks, as well as similar avalanche\\nphenomena, is driven by cascading failures. At the critical point, the cascade\\nbegins as a critical branching process, where each failing node (element)\\ntriggers, on average, the failure of one other node. As nodes continue to fail,\\nthe network becomes increasingly fragile and the branching factor grows. If the\\nfailure process does not reach extinction during its critical phase, the\\nnetwork undergoes an abrupt collapse. Here, we implement the analogy between\\nthis dynamic and birth-death processes to derive new analytical results and\\nsignificantly optimize numerical calculations. Using this approach, we analyze\\nthree key aspects of the dynamics: the probability of collapse, the duration of\\navalanches, and the length of the cascading plateau phase preceding a collapse.\\nThis analysis quantifies how system size and the intensity of the initial\\ntriggering event influence these characteristics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:12:43Z\"}"}
