The intertwined confinement and\\nchiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative\\naccuracy at larger densities. Specifically it is shown that the self-consistent\\nresolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for\\neven the qualitative properties of the cumulants. Our results are in\\nquantitative agreement with lattice and functional QCD benchmarks at vanishing\\nand small chemical potentials. Moreover, they offer novel insights in the\\ndynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end\\npoint. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov\\nloop potential in finite density QCD, which, alongside the aforementioned\\nobservables, can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory\\ncomputations at finite density.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:06:14Z\"}"}
