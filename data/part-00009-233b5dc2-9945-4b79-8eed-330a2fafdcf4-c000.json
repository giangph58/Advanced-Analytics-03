The reconstruction conjecture\\npostulates that every graph of order at least 3 is reconstructible. We show\\nthat interval graphs with at least three vertices are reconstructible. For this\\npurpose we develop a technique to handle separations in the context of\\nreconstruction. This resolves a major roadblock to using graph structure theory\\nin the context of reconstruction. To apply our novel technique, we also develop\\na resilient combinatorial structure theory for interval graphs. A consequence\\nof our result is that interval graphs can be reconstructed in polynomial time.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM,cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:42:05Z\"}"}
