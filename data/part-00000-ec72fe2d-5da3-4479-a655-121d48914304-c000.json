Understanding how visual attention is allocated is\\nessential for optimizing interface design. However, collecting Eye-tracking\\n(ET) data presents challenges related to cost, privacy, and scalability.\\nComputational models provide alternatives for predicting gaze patterns, thereby\\nadvancing InfoVis research. In our study, we conducted an ET experiment with 40\\nparticipants who analyzed graphs while responding to questions of varying\\ncomplexity within the context of digital forensics. We compared human scanpaths\\nwith synthetic ones generated by models such as DeepGaze, UMSS, and Gazeformer.\\nOur research evaluates the accuracy of these models and examines how question\\ncomplexity and number of nodes influence performance. This work contributes to\\nthe development of predictive modeling in visual analytics, offering insights\\nthat can enhance the design and effectiveness of InfoVis systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:43:42Z\"}"}
