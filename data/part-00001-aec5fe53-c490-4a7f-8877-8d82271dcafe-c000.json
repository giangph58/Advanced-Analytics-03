{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23823v1\", \"title\": \"Blockchain for Federated Learning in the Internet of Things: Trustworthy\\n  Adaptation, Standards, and the Road Ahead\", \"summary\": \"As edge computing gains prominence in Internet of Things (IoTs), smart\\ncities, and autonomous systems, the demand for real-time machine intelligence\\nwith low latency and model reliability continues to grow. Federated Learning\\n(FL) addresses these needs by enabling distributed model training without\\ncentralizing user data, yet it remains reliant on centralized servers and lacks\\nbuilt-in mechanisms for transparency and trust. Blockchain and Distributed\\nLedger Technologies (DLTs) can fill this gap by introducing immutability,\\ndecentralized coordination, and verifiability into FL workflows. This article\\npresents current standardization efforts from 3GPP, ETSI, ITU-T, IEEE, and\\nO-RAN that steer the integration of FL and blockchain in IoT ecosystems. We\\nthen propose a blockchain-based FL framework that replaces the centralized\\naggregator, incorporates reputation monitoring of IoT devices, and minimizes\\noverhead via selective on-chain storage of model updates. We validate our\\napproach with IOTA Tangle, demonstrating stable throughput and block\\nconfirmations, even under increasing FL workloads. Finally, we discuss\\narchitectural considerations and future directions for embedding trustworthy\\nand resource-efficient FL in emerging 6G networks and vertical IoT\\napplications. Our results underscore the potential of DLT-enhanced FL to meet\\nstringent trust and energy requirements of next-generation IoT deployments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:19:18Z\"}"}
