A large\\nclass of cross-sections is allowed, and the resulting asymptotic expansions\\nreflect both the sharpness of the peak and the geometric shape of its\\ncross-section. The results are an extension of previous works dealing with\\npeaks whose cross-sections are balls.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:24:29Z\"}"}
