{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02498v1\", \"title\": \"VISTA: Unsupervised 2D Temporal Dependency Representations for Time\\n  Series Anomaly Detection\", \"summary\": \"Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is essential for uncovering rare and\\npotentially harmful events in unlabeled time series data. Existing methods are\\nhighly dependent on clean, high-quality inputs, making them susceptible to\\nnoise and real-world imperfections. Additionally, intricate temporal\\nrelationships in time series data are often inadequately captured in\\ntraditional 1D representations, leading to suboptimal modeling of dependencies.\\nWe introduce VISTA, a training-free, unsupervised TSAD algorithm designed to\\novercome these challenges. VISTA features three core modules: 1) Time Series\\nDecomposition using Seasonal and Trend Decomposition via Loess (STL) to\\ndecompose noisy time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components; 2)\\nTemporal Self-Attention, which transforms 1D time series into 2D temporal\\ncorrelation matrices for richer dependency modeling and anomaly detection; and\\n3) Multivariate Temporal Aggregation, which uses a pretrained feature extractor\\nto integrate cross-variable information into a unified, memory-efficient\\nrepresentation. VISTA's training-free approach enables rapid deployment and\\neasy hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for industrial applications. It\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on five multivariate TSAD benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:20:49Z\"}"}
