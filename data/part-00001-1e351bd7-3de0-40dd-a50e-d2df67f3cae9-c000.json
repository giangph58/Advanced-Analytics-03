We obtain as a consequence that these solitons must have harmonic\\nWeyl tensor and vanishing Bach tensor. We also finish the classification of\\ncomplete locally conformally flat steady $\\\\rho$-Einstein solitons and classify\\nthese manifolds when their Bach tensor is radially nonnegative and\\n$n\\\\in\\\\{3,4\\\\}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:22:47Z\"}"}
