However,\\ncurrent evaluations of AI-CDS often fail to capture when AI is and is not\\nuseful to clinicians. This position paper reflects on our work and influential\\nAI-CDS literature to advocate for moving beyond evaluation metrics like Trust,\\nReliance, Acceptance, and Performance on the AI's task (what we term the \\\"trap\\\"\\nof human-AI collaboration). Although these metrics can be meaningful in some\\nsimple scenarios, we argue that optimizing for them ignores important ways that\\nAI falls short of clinical benefit, as well as ways that clinicians\\nsuccessfully use AI. As the fields of HCI and AI in healthcare develop new ways\\nto design and evaluate CDS tools, we call on the community to prioritize\\necologically valid, domain-appropriate study setups that measure the emergent\\nforms of value that AI can bring to healthcare professionals.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,q-bio.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:28:56Z\"}"}
