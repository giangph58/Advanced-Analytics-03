The key idea of our\\nmethod is a pretraining strategy that allows our transformer to learn plausible\\ncandidate articulations for 3D shapes based on a geometric-driven search\\nwithout manual articulation annotation. The search automatically discovers\\nphysically valid part motions that do not cause detachments or collisions with\\nother shape parts. Our experiments indicate that this geometric pretraining\\nstrategy, along with carefully designed choices in our transformer\\narchitecture, yields state-of-the-art results in articulation inference in the\\nPartNet-Mobility dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:35:17Z\"}"}
