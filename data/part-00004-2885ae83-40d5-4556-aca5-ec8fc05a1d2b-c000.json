{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06755v1\", \"title\": \"FANeRV: Frequency Separation and Augmentation based Neural\\n  Representation for Video\", \"summary\": \"Neural representations for video (NeRV) have gained considerable attention\\nfor their strong performance across various video tasks. However, existing NeRV\\nmethods often struggle to capture fine spatial details, resulting in vague\\nreconstructions. In this paper, we present a Frequency Separation and\\nAugmentation based Neural Representation for video (FANeRV), which addresses\\nthese limitations with its core Wavelet Frequency Upgrade Block.This block\\nexplicitly separates input frames into high and low-frequency components using\\ndiscrete wavelet transform, followed by targeted enhancement using specialized\\nmodules. Finally, a specially designed gated network effectively fuses these\\nfrequency components for optimal reconstruction. Additionally, convolutional\\nresidual enhancement blocks are integrated into the later stages of the network\\nto balance parameter distribution and improve the restoration of high-frequency\\ndetails. Experimental results demonstrate that FANeRV significantly improves\\nreconstruction performance and excels in multiple tasks, including video\\ncompression, inpainting, and interpolation, outperforming existing NeRV\\nmethods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:19:35Z\"}"}
