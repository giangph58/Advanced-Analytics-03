By leveraging an large language models-driven\\nmulti-agent framework to construct user digital twins integrated with\\nmultidimensional user profile features, it enables deep simulation and precise\\nprediction of users' charging and discharging decision-making patterns.\\nAdditionally, a data- and knowledge-driven dynamic incentive mechanism is\\nproposed, combining a distributed optimization model under network constraints\\nto optimize the grid-user interaction while ensuring both economic viability\\nand security. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach significantly\\nimproves load peak-valley regulation and charging/discharging strategies.\\nExperimental validation highlights the system's substantial advantages in load\\nbalancing, user satisfaction and grid stability, providing decision-makers with\\na scalable V2G management tool that promotes the sustainable, synergistic\\ndevelopment of vehicle-grid integration.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:16:06Z\"}"}
