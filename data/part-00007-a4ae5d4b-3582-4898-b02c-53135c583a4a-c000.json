However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges,\\nparticularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process\\nlarge volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these\\nlimitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V\\nspectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an\\nautoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly\\ndetection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within\\nspectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May\\n5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly\\ncomplex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in\\nmagnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy\\nstorage and possible triggers for flares. Notably, the detected anomalies are\\nhighly localized, making them particularly challenging to identify in\\nmagnetogram images using current manual methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:20:47Z\"}"}
