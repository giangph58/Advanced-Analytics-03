{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06824v1\", \"title\": \"A Roadmap for Improving Data Reliability and Sharing in Crosslinking\\n  Mass Spectrometry\", \"summary\": \"Crosslinking Mass Spectrometry (MS) can uncover protein-protein interactions\\nand provide structural information on proteins in their native cellular\\nenvironments. Despite its promise, the field remains hampered by inconsistent\\ndata formats, variable approaches to error control, and insufficient\\ninteroperability with global data repositories. Recent advances, especially in\\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) models and pipeline benchmarking, show that\\nCrosslinking MS data can reach a reliability that matches the demand of\\nintegrative structural biology. To drive meaningful progress, however, the\\ncommunity must agree on error estimation, open data formats, and streamlined\\nrepository submissions. This perspective highlights these challenges, clarifies\\nremaining barriers, and frames practical next steps. Successful field\\nharmonisation will enhance the acceptance of Crosslinking MS in the broader\\nbiological community and is critical for the dependability of the data, no\\nmatter where it is produced.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.OT\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:32:39Z\"}"}
