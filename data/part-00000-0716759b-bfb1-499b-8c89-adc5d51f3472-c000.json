Based on Mawhin's coincidence degree theory some\\nsufficient conditions for existence of periodic solutions are obtained. We\\nvalidate our findings through an illustrative example and numerical\\nsimulations, showing that constant coefficients lead to steady-state dynamics,\\nwhile periodic variations induce oscillatory behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:50:32Z\"}"}
