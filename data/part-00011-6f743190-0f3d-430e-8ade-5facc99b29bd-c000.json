{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23690v1\", \"title\": \"Effects of the delocalized charge distribution in trapped ion-atom\\n  collisions\", \"summary\": \"In the study of ion-atom interactions, the ion often remain trapped during\\nthe experiments. However, the effects of the trapping potential of the ion on\\nion-neutral interactions remain largely unexplored. Although trap-assisted\\nion-neutral complex formation has been experimentally studied and described by\\napplying semiclassical theories where the ion is treated as a point charge\\nparticle, the potential effect of a delocalized charge distribution of a\\nconfined ion due to its quantum mechanical wavefunction has not been\\nconsidered. To remedy this, in the present theoretical work we substitute the\\npoint charge of the ion with a delocalized charged distribution according to\\nits motional ground state in the trap. Our results show that the trapping\\nfrequency and hence the spatial extension of the ion's ground-state\\nwavefunction drastically affects the elastic and transport cross sections in\\ninteractions with neutral atoms. Stimulated by these results, we propose\\nexperimental procedures to verify the effects of the delocalize charge\\ndistribution in ion-atom interactions via measuring the heating rate of the ion\\ndue to the energy transfer in atomic collisions. Our novel approach brings new\\npossibilities for investigating ion-neutral systems and, through them, new\\nperspectives on ionic polarons and potentially a better understanding of\\ntrap-induced losses in ion-neutral experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:41:42Z\"}"}
