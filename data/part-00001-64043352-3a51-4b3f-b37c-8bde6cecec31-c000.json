{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06552v1\", \"title\": \"Understanding Users' Security and Privacy Concerns and Attitudes Towards\\n  Conversational AI Platforms\", \"summary\": \"The widespread adoption of conversational AI platforms has introduced new\\nsecurity and privacy risks. While these risks and their mitigation strategies\\nhave been extensively researched from a technical perspective, users'\\nperceptions of these platforms' security and privacy remain largely unexplored.\\nIn this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis of over 2.5M user posts from\\nthe r/ChatGPT Reddit community to understand users' security and privacy\\nconcerns and attitudes toward conversational AI platforms. Our qualitative\\nanalysis reveals that users are concerned about each stage of the data\\nlifecycle (i.e., collection, usage, and retention). They seek mitigations for\\nsecurity vulnerabilities, compliance with privacy regulations, and greater\\ntransparency and control in data handling. We also find that users exhibit\\nvaried behaviors and preferences when interacting with these platforms. Some\\nusers proactively safeguard their data and adjust privacy settings, while\\nothers prioritize convenience over privacy risks, dismissing privacy concerns\\nin favor of benefits, or feel resigned to inevitable data sharing. Through\\nqualitative content and regression analysis, we discover that users' concerns\\nevolve over time with the evolving AI landscape and are influenced by\\ntechnological developments and major events. Based on our findings, we provide\\nrecommendations for users, platforms, enterprises, and policymakers to enhance\\ntransparency, improve data controls, and increase user trust and adoption.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:22:48Z\"}"}
