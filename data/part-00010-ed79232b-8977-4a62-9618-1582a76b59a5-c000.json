This framework introduces the concept of a\\nintroducing the multi-service-modal UE (MSMU) system, which allows a single UE\\nto handle both eMBB and uRLLC services. The proposed framework integrates\\ntraffic demand prediction, route optimization, RAN slicing, service\\nidentification, and radio resource management under uncertainty. The challenge\\nof dynamic environments in such a system is addressed by decomposing the\\noptimization problem into long-term (L-SP) and short-term (S-SP) subproblems.\\nUsing a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, the proposed approach allows the\\nprediction of eMBB and uRLLC traffic demands and optimal routes for RAN slicing\\nin the L-SP. For the S-SP, another LSTM model is employed to handle real-time\\nservice type identification and resource management based on long-term\\npredictions. To support continuous adaptation, continual learning is\\nincorporated into the S-SP framework, allowing the model to learn new service\\ntypes while retaining prior knowledge. Experimental results show that the\\nproposed framework efficiently manages dual-mode UEs, achieving low mean square\\nerror for traffic demand (0.003), resource block prediction (0.003), and power\\nprediction (0.002), with 99\\\\% accuracy in service type and route selection and\\nover 95\\\\% average accuracy for continual service adaptation across seven tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:40:36Z\"}"}
