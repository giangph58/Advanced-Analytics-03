{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02527v1\", \"title\": \"Recent results on strangeness enhancement in small collision systems\\n  with ALICE\", \"summary\": \"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that, at sufficiently high temperature\\nand energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition from confined\\nhadrons to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons known as the quark-gluon\\nplasma (QGP). One of the historically proposed signatures of QGP formation is\\nstrangeness enhancement (SE), characterized by an increased production of\\nstrange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions relative to proton--proton (pp)\\ninteractions. At the LHC, the ALICE experiment has measured a continuous\\nincrease in the strange-to-non-strange hadron yield ratios as a function of\\nmidrapidity charged-particle multiplicity, not only in large systems like\\nPb--Pb but also in small systems such as pp and p--Pb. The origin of SE in\\nsmall systems is still under debate, motivating further experimental\\ninvestigations. This article presents recent ALICE analyses that offer\\ncomplementary insights into the phenomenon. These include (i)\\nmulti-differential studies using event-shape observables such as transverse\\nspherocity and the concept of effective energy, and (ii) the first measurement\\nof multiplicity distributions of strange and multi-strange hadrons,\\nP($\\\\textit{n}_{S}$), in pp collisions.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:33:27Z\"}"}
