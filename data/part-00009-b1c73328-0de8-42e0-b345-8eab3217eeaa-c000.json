Let $K<G$ be a maximal compact subgroup and $P<G$ be a minimal\\nparabolic subgroup. For any pair $(F,x)$, where $F$ is a maximal flat in $G/K$\\nand $x \\\\in G/P$ is opposite to the Weyl chambers determined by $F$, we define a\\nprojection $\\\\Phi(F, x) \\\\in F$ which is continuous and $G$-equivariant.\\nFurthermore, if $q \\\\geq 3$, we exhibit a $G$-equivariant continuous map defined\\non an open subset of full measure of the space of $q$-tuples of $(G/P)^q$ with\\nimage in $G/K$. When $G$ is the orientation preserving isometries of real\\nhyperbolic space and $q = 3$, we recover the geometric barycenter of the\\ncorresponding ideal triangle. All our proofs are constructive.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:53:07Z\"}"}
