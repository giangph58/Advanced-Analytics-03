In this\\nwork, we propose to create autonomous interactive robots, by training a model\\nto imitate operator data. Our model is trained on a dataset of human-robot\\ninteractions, where an expert operator is asked to vary the interactions and\\nmood of the robot, while the operator commands as well as the pose of the human\\nand robot are recorded. Our approach learns to predict continuous operator\\ncommands through a diffusion process and discrete commands through a\\nclassifier, all unified within a single transformer architecture. We evaluate\\nthe resulting model in simulation and with a user study on the real system. We\\nshow that our method enables simple autonomous human-robot interactions that\\nare comparable to the expert-operator baseline, and that users can recognize\\nthe different robot moods as generated by our model. Finally, we demonstrate a\\nzero-shot transfer of our model onto a different robotic platform with the same\\noperator interface.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:06:44Z\"}"}
