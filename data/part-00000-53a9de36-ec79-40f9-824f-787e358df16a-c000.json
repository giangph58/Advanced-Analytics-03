Recent quantum technology advances\\nhave driven exponential growth in quantum information research, with resultant\\npublications achieving significantly elevated impact. Within academia, citation\\ncounts serve as a key metric for evaluating research impact, often directly\\ninfluencing career advancement and compensation structures. Motivated by these\\nobservations, we propose a potential protocol for practical quantum advantage\\nin boosting citations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.pop-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.pop-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:13:48Z\"}"}
