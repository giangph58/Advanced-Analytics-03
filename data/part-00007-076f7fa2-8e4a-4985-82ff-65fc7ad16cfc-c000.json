{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06620v1\", \"title\": \"InstantSticker: Realistic Decal Blending via Disentangled Object\\n  Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"We present InstantSticker, a disentangled reconstruction pipeline based on\\nImage-Based Lighting (IBL), which focuses on highly realistic decal blending,\\nsimulates stickers attached to the reconstructed surface, and allows for\\ninstant editing and real-time rendering. To achieve stereoscopic impression of\\nthe decal, we introduce shadow factor into IBL, which can be adaptively\\noptimized during training. This allows the shadow brightness of surfaces to be\\naccurately decomposed rather than baked into the diffuse color, ensuring that\\nthe edited texture exhibits authentic shading. To address the issues of warping\\nand blurriness in previous methods, we apply As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)\\nparameterization to pre-unfold a specified area of the mesh and use the local\\nUV mapping combined with a neural texture map to enhance the ability to express\\nhigh-frequency details in that area. For instant editing, we utilize the Disney\\nBRDF model, explicitly defining material colors with 3-channel diffuse albedo.\\nThis enables instant replacement of albedo RGB values during the editing\\nprocess, avoiding the prolonged optimization required in previous approaches.\\nIn our experiment, we introduce the Ratio Variance Warping (RVW) metric to\\nevaluate the local geometric warping of the decal area. Extensive experimental\\nresults demonstrate that our method surpasses previous decal blending methods\\nin terms of editing quality, editing speed and rendering speed, achieving the\\nstate-of-the-art.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T06:36:36Z\"}"}
