This paper addresses these numerical issues by proposing\\na generalized flux function that establishes a continuous flux expression for\\ntwo-phase flows by introducing an additional throat variable $\\\\Theta$. Two\\napproaches for expressing this additional throat variable are introduced: the\\nfirst applies regularization strategies, while the second constructs an\\nadditional residual constraint equation. It is shown that this approach\\nsignificantly improves accuracy and ensures the temporal convergence, as\\ndemonstrated through various numerical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:14:42Z\"}"}
