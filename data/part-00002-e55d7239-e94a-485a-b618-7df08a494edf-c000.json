In this study, we extend the\\nrecently developed statistical approach, Correlation Integral Likelihood (CIL)\\nmethod to enable robust parameter identification from a single snapshot of an\\nexperimental pattern. Using the chlorite-iodite-malonic acid (CIMA) reaction --\\na well-studied system that produces Turing patterns -- as a test case, we\\naddress key experimental challenges such as measurement noise, model-data\\ndiscrepancies, and the presence of mixed-mode patterns, where different spatial\\nstructures (e.g., coexisting stripes and dots) emerge under the same\\nconditions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method accurately\\nestimates model parameters, even with incomplete or noisy data. This approach\\nlays the groundwork for future applications in developmental biology, chemical\\nreaction modelling, and other systems with heterogeneous output.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:33:56Z\"}"}
