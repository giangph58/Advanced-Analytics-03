A key strength\\nof our method is the use of a Context-Aware Tokenizer (CAT), which enables\\nopen-vocabulary classification. This allows the model to classify text and\\nsymbol patterns across an unlimited range of classes, extending its\\nclassification capabilities beyond the scope of its training alphabet of\\npatterns. As a result, it unlocks applications such as the recognition of new\\nalphabets and languages. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the\\npotential of Rosetta to successfully classify Out-Of-Distribution visual\\npatterns and diverse sets of alphabets and scripts, including but not limited\\nto Chinese, Greek, Russian, French, Spanish, and Japanese.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:58:25Z\"}"}
