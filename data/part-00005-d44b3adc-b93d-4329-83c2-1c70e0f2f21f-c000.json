We show that these\\ngeometric realizations are Mori Dream Spaces, as well, and that they can be\\nconstructed so that they induce factorizations of the original birational maps\\nas compositions of wall-crossings. In the case of toric birational maps between\\nnormal $\\\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial, projective toric varieties, we provide several\\nSageMath functions to work with $\\\\mathbb{C}^*$-actions and birational geometry;\\nin particular we show how to explicitly construct a moment polytope of a toric\\ngeometric realization. Moreover, by embedding Mori Dream Spaces in toric\\nvarieties, we obtain geometric realizations of birational maps of Mori Dream\\nSpaces as restrictions of toric geometric realizations. We also provide\\nexamples and discuss when a geometric realization is Fano.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:07:54Z\"}"}
