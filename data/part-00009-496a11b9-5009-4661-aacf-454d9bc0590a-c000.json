Here, networks can sustain public good provision by\\nspreading information about people's behaviour. I find a critical threshold in\\nnetwork connectedness at which public good provision drops sharply, even though\\nagents are highly heterogeneous. Technology change can tear a community's\\nsocial fabric by pushing high-skilled workers to withdraw from their local\\ncommunity. This can help explain rising resentment toward perceived ``elites''\\n-- their withdrawal actively harms those left behind. Moreover, well-meaning\\npolicies that upskill workers can make them worse off by reducing network\\nconnectedness.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:23:32Z\"}"}
