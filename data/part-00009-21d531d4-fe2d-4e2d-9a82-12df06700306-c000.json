We present both the azimuthal-angle-averaged and\\nazimuthal-angle-dependent soft functions in impact-parameter space, making them\\nsuitable for small $q_T$ resummation calculations. Their analytic expressions\\nare provided in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Our results offer essential\\ningredients for a complete higher-order perturbative calculation of the TMD\\nsoft function.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:34:31Z\"}"}
