To characterize and compute this\\namplification, two fundamental analytical frameworks have been proposed: the\\nprivacy blanket by Balle et al. (CRYPTO 2019) and the clone paradigm (including\\nboth the standard clone and stronger clone) by Feldman et al. (FOCS 2021, SODA\\n2023). All these methods rely on decomposing local randomizers.\\n  In this work, we introduce a unified analysis framework--the general clone\\nparadigm--which encompasses all possible decompositions. We identify the\\noptimal decomposition within the general clone paradigm. Moreover, we develop a\\nsimple and efficient algorithm to compute the exact value of the optimal\\nprivacy amplification bounds via Fast Fourier Transform. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that the computed upper bounds for privacy amplification closely\\napproximate the lower bounds, highlighting the tightness of our approach.\\nFinally, using our algorithm, we conduct the first systematic analysis of the\\njoint composition of LDP protocols in the shuffle model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:11:17Z\"}"}
