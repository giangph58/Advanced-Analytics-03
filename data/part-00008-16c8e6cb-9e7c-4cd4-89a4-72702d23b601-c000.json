In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized\\nthrough intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing\\nadditional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative --\\nsubsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the\\nsystem, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through\\nresetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few\\nparameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the\\nreset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase\\ndiagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span\\na wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium,\\nmean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder.\\nDespite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical\\npredictions, validated by simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,nlin.AO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:53:44Z\"}"}
