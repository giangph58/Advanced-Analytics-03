{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05979v1\", \"title\": \"An Empirical Study of GPT-4o Image Generation Capabilities\", \"summary\": \"The landscape of image generation has rapidly evolved, from early GAN-based\\napproaches to diffusion models and, most recently, to unified generative\\narchitectures that seek to bridge understanding and generation tasks. Recent\\nadvances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of\\nhigh-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains\\nmysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text\\ngeneration have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework\\nfor those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's\\nimage generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and\\ncommercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including\\ntext-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with\\nmore than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of\\nGPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of\\ngenerative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising\\ndirections for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of\\narchitectural design and data scaling.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:34:36Z\"}"}
