Emphasis is \\\\change{placed} on the dependence on the maximum\\ncontrol strength $u_\\\\text{max}$. General constraints on the optimal protocol\\nare derived and used to rigorously parameterize the time-optimal solution. Two\\nconcrete problems are investigated. For generic state preparation problems,\\nboth multiple bang-bang and bang-singular-bang are legitimate and should be\\nconsidered. Generally, the optimal is bang-bang for small $u_\\\\text{max}$, and\\nthere exists a state-dependent critical amplitude above which singular control\\nemerges. For the X-gate operation of a qubit, the optimal protocol \\\\change{is\\nexclusively} multiple bang-bang. The minimum gate time is about 80\\\\% of that\\nbased on the resonant Rabi $\\\\pi$-pulse over a wide range of control strength;\\nin the $u_\\\\text{max} \\\\rightarrow 0$ limit this ratio is derived to be $\\\\pi/4$.\\nTo develop practically feasible protocols, we present methods to smooth the\\nabrupt changes in the bang-bang control while preserving perfect gate fidelity.\\n\\\\change{The presence of bang-bang segments in the time-optimal protocol}\\nindicates that the high-frequency components and a full calculation (instead of\\nthe commonly adopted Rotating Wave Approximation) are essential for the\\nultimate quantum speed limit.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:48:50Z\"}"}
