The DRP simplifies the study\\nof many-body problems by systematically reducing their effective spatial\\ndimension while retaining essential physics. This method works for electron\\ngases in a diverse array of settings: in any number of spatial dimensions, in\\nthe presence of Zeeman fields, with spin-orbit coupling, including repulsive or\\nattractive interactions. Focusing on two-point correlation functions, the DRP\\nidentifies a minimal subspace relevant for capturing analytic properties,\\nfacilitating efficient computation of critical phenomena in electronic systems.\\nThis work outlines the assumptions, proof, and applications of the DRP,\\nemphasizing its simplicity and broad applicability for future studies in\\ncorrelated electron physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:17:49Z\"}"}
