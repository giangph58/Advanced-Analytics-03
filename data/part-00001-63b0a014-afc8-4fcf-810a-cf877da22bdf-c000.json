Brutely upgrading libraries to the latest versions is not\\nfeasible because breaking changes and bloated dependencies could be introduced,\\nwhich may break the software project or introduce maintenance efforts.\\nTherefore, balancing the technical lag reduction and the prevention of newly\\nintroduced issues are critical for dependency management. To this end, LagEase\\nis introduced as a novel tool designed to address the challenges of mitigating\\nthe technical lags and avoid incompatibility risks and bloated dependencies.\\nExperimental results show that LagEase outperforms Dependabot, providing a more\\neffective solution for managing Maven dependencies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:48:28Z\"}"}
