The main and\\nsatellite lines of the Fe XXIV--XXVI K-shell transitions were resolved for the\\nfirst time from stellar sources. We conducted line ratio analysis to\\ninvestigate any deviations from collisional onization equilibrium (CIE) and\\nMaxwell electron energy distribution with a single-temperature. By using five\\ncombinations of direct excitation lines and dielectronic recombination\\nsatellite lines in three line complexes (Fe He$\\\\alpha$, Ly$\\\\alpha$, and\\nHe$\\\\beta$), we found that the plasma is well characterized by two-temperature\\nthermal plasmas with temperatures of 1.7 and 4.3 keV, which is consistent with\\na thermal broadening of Fe XXV and the broadband fitting results in the 1.7--10\\nkeV band. Other forms of deviation from a single-temperature plasma, such as\\ndifferent ionization and electron temperatures or the $\\\\kappa$ distribution for\\nthe electron energy distributions, are not favored, which is reasonable for\\nstellar coronae at quiescence. This study demonstrates the utility of the Fe\\nK-shell line ratio diagnostics to probe plasma conditions using X-ray\\nmicrocalorimeters.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:56:38Z\"}"}
