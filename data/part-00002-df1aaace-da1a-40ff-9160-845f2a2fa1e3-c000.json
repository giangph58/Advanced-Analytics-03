Let\\n$\\\\sigma \\\\in S(n)$ be a permutation drawn uniformly at random. If the array only\\ncontains $o(n / \\\\log n)$ distinct elements, then almost surely, for all $0 < s\\n< t < 1$, the permuted product of their exponentials $\\\\prod_{i = [s n]}^{[t n]}\\ne^{A_{\\\\sigma(i),n}/n}$ converges in norm to $e^{(t - s) A}$. For an array of\\nfinite-dimensional matrices, convergence holds without this restriction. The\\nproof of the latter result consists of an estimate valid in a general Banach\\nalgebra, and an application of a matrix concentration inequality.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:52Z\"}"}
