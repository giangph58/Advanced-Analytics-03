{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07839v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have long been a hot topic in the\\ncybersecurity community. In recent years, with the introduction of deep\\nlearning (DL) techniques, IDS have made great progress due to their increasing\\ngeneralizability. The rationale behind this is that by learning the underlying\\npatterns of known system behaviors, IDS detection can be generalized to\\nintrusions that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. In this survey, we refer to\\nthis type of IDS as DL-based IDS (DL-IDS). From the perspective of DL, this\\nsurvey systematically reviews all the stages of DL-IDS, including data\\ncollection, log storage, log parsing, graph summarization, attack detection,\\nand attack investigation. To accommodate current researchers, a section\\ndescribing the publicly available benchmark datasets is included. This survey\\nfurther discusses current challenges and potential future research directions,\\naiming to help researchers understand the basic ideas and visions of DL-IDS\\nresearch, as well as to motivate their research interests.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:18:56Z\"}"}
