We develop wave perturbation theory to\\nshow that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of\\nhigh-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter\\ndomination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free\\nstreaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot\\ndark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power\\nspectra of Newtonian Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological\\ncontext, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise\\nisocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation\\nequality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial\\nstability of dark matter halos.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:46:39Z\"}"}
