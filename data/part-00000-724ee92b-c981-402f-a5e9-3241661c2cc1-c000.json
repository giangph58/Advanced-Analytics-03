{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01567v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Computing for Optimizing Aircraft Loading\", \"summary\": \"The aircraft loading optimization problem is a computationally hard problem\\nwith the best known classical algorithm scaling exponentially with the number\\nof objects. We propose a quantum approach based on a multi-angle variant of the\\nQAOA algorithm (Multi-Angle Layered Variational Quantum Algorithm (MAL-VQA))\\ndesigned to utilize a smaller number of two qubit gates in the quantum circuit\\nas compared to the standard QAOA algorithm so that the quantum optimization\\nalgorithm can be run on near-term ion-trap quantum processing units (QPU). We\\nalso describe a novel cost function implementation that can handle many\\ndifferent types of inequality constraints without the overhead of introducing\\nslack variables in the quantum circuit so that larger problems with complex\\nconstraints may be represented on near-term QPUs which have low qubit counts.\\nWe demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on different instances of the\\naircraft loading problem by execution on IonQ QPUs Aria and Forte. Our\\nexperiments obtain the optimal solutions for all the problem instances studied\\nranging from 12 qubits to 28 qubits. This shows the potential scalability of\\nthe method to significantly larger problem sizes with the improvement of\\nquantum hardware in the near future as well as the robustness of the quantum\\nalgorithm against varying initial guesses and varying constraints of different\\nproblem instances.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:10:11Z\"}"}
