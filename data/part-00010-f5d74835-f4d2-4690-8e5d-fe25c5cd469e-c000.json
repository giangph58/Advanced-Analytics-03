In particular, we show that synthetic $\\\\infty$-categories are\\nclosed under partial map classifiers assuming Phoa's principle, and we isolate\\na new reflective subuniverse of types within which the Sierpi\\\\'nski cone (a lax\\ncolimit) can be computed as a partial map classifier by strengthening the Segal\\ncondition.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LO\", \"categories\": \"cs.LO,cs.PL,math.CT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:27:54Z\"}"}
