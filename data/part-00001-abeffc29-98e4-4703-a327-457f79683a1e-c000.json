{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23928v1\", \"title\": \"Superconducting Spin-Singlet QuBit in a Triangulene Spin Chain\", \"summary\": \"Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as\\nrealizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-$1$ chain, offer a promising\\nplatform for quantum information processing. We propose a superconducting\\nspin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate.\\nUsing the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we find a manifold of two\\nlowest-lying, isolated spin-singlet states that undergo an avoided crossing. A\\nqubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random-field noise and\\nquasi-particle poisoning. We also introduce a mesoscopic device architecture,\\nbased on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that\\nquantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit.\\nAn effective two-level description of the device is validated using\\ntime-dependent NRG.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:23:17Z\"}"}
