We\\nprovide a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for normalized\\nsolutions and for energy ground states for every value of the nonlinearity\\npowers. We show that the interplay between a defocusing standard and a focusing\\npoint nonlinearity gives rise to new phenomena with respect to those observed\\nwith single nonlinearities, standard combined nonlinearities, and combined\\nfocusing standard and pointwise nonlinearities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:04:43Z\"}"}
