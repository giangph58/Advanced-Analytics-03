However, reaching high\\nreadout fidelities in hole spin qubits remains elusive and is complicated by a\\ncombination of site-dependent spin anisotropies and short spin relaxation\\ntimes. Here, we analyze the different error processes that arise during readout\\nusing a double-latched scheme in a germanium double quantum dot hole spin qubit\\nsystem. We first investigate the spin-to-charge conversion process as a\\nfunction of magnetic field orientation, and configure the system to\\nadiabatically map the $\\\\lvert \\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow \\\\rangle$ state to the only\\nnon-blockaded state. We reveal a strong dependence of the spin relaxation rates\\non magnetic field strength and minimize this relaxation by operating at low\\nfields. We further characterize and mitigate the error processes that arise\\nduring the double-latching process. By combining an RF charge sensor, a\\ndouble-latching process, and optimized magnetic field parameters, we achieve a\\nsingle-shot single-qubit state-preparation-and-measurement fidelity of 97.0%,\\nthe highest reported fidelity for hole spin qubits. Unlike prior works and\\nvital to usability, we simultaneously maintain universal control of both spins.\\nThese findings lay the foundation for the reproducible achievement of\\nhigh-fidelity readout in hole-based spin quantum processors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:57:26Z\"}"}
