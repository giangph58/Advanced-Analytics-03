{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04832v1\", \"title\": \"Pullback and Weil transfer on Chow groups\", \"summary\": \"In the paper ``Weil transfer of algebraic cycles'', published by the second\\nauthor in Indagationes Mathematicae about 25 years ago, a Weil transfer map for\\nChow groups of smooth algebraic varieties has been constructed and its basic\\nproperties have been established. The proof of commutativity with the pullback\\nhomomorphisms given there used a variant of Moving Lemma suffering a lack of\\nreference. Here we are providing an alternative proof based on a more\\ncontemporary construction of the pullback via a deformation to the normal cone.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:43:35Z\"}"}
