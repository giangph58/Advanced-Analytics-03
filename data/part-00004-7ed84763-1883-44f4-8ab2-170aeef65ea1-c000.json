It is not clear how nuclei bound\\nby a few MeV can emerge in environments characterized by temperatures above 100\\nMeV [3-5], about 100,000 times hotter than the center of the Sun. Despite\\nextensive studies, this question remained unanswered. The ALICE Collaboration\\nnow addresses it with a novel approach using deuteron-pion momentum\\ncorrelations in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider\\n(LHC). Our results provide model-independent evidence that about 80% of the\\nobserved (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear fusion reactions [6] following\\nthe decay of short-lived resonances, such as the $\\\\Delta (1232)$. These\\nfindings resolve a crucial gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in\\nhadronic collisions. Beyond answering the fundamental question on how nuclei\\nare formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be employed in the modeling\\nof the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays [7] and dark matter\\ndecays [8,9].\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:40:57Z\"}"}
