The 12 Principles of Animation [1]\\nare a well-established framework animators use to create movements that make\\ncharacters appear convincing, dynamic, and emotionally expressive. This paper\\nproposes a novel approach that leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to\\nimplement key animation principles, providing a learnable, explainable,\\nmodulable, online adaptable and composable model for automatic expressive\\nmotion generation. DMPs, originally developed for general imitation learning in\\nrobotics and grounded in a spring-damper system design, offer mathematical\\nproperties that make them particularly suitable for this task. Specifically,\\nthey enable modulation of the intensities of individual principles and\\nfacilitate the decomposition of complex, expressive motion sequences into\\nlearnable and parametrizable primitives. We present the mathematical\\nformulation of the parameterized animation principles and demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our framework through experiments and application on three\\nrobotic platforms with different kinematic configurations, in simulation, on\\nactual robots and in a user study. Our results show that the approach allows\\nfor creating diverse and nuanced expressions using a single base model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:46:50Z\"}"}
