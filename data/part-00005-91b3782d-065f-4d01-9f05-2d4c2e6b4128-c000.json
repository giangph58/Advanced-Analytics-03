{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24366v1\", \"title\": \"StochasticSplats: Stochastic Rasterization for Sorting-Free 3D Gaussian\\n  Splatting\", \"summary\": \"3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a popular radiance field method, with many\\napplication-specific extensions. Most variants rely on the same core algorithm:\\ndepth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This\\nensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to\\nbuilt-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering\\noffers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and\\ncounter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily\\nfaster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian\\nsplatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased\\nMonte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need\\nfor sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The\\nnumber of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off\\ncomputation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders,\\nenabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual\\nquality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted\\nrasterization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:46:18Z\"}"}
