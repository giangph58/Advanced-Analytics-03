This study aims to develop an analytical\\nmethod for accurately identifying leak locations in gas pipelines based on\\nunsteady gas flow dynamics. A novel approach is proposed that utilizes pressure\\nvariations at the inlet and outlet points to determine the minimum fixation\\ntime (t = t1) required for real-time leak detection. Through mathematical\\nmodeling and numerical analysis, the study demonstrates that the ratio of\\npressure drops at different points along the pipeline can be effectively used\\nto pinpoint leakage locations. The results indicate that the proposed method\\nsignificantly improves detection accuracy and response time, making it a viable\\nsolution for integration into gas pipeline monitoring and control systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:59:24Z\"}"}
