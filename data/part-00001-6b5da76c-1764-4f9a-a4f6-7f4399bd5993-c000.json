The main novelty of our work is that, due to the absence of\\ninvariances, trivial resonances always take precedence over quasi-resonances.\\nThe derivation of the nonlinear effective dynamics is justified up time to\\n$\\\\delta T$ , where $T =\\\\varepsilon^{-2}$ is the appropriate timescale and\\n$\\\\delta$ is independent of $L$ and $\\\\varepsilon$. We use Feynmann interaction\\ndiagrams, here adapted to a normal form reduction and to the coupled nature of\\nour real-valued system. We also introduce a frequency decomposition at the\\nlevel of the diagrammatic and develop a new combinatorial tool which allows us\\nto work with the Klein-Gordon dispersion relation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:37:47Z\"}"}
