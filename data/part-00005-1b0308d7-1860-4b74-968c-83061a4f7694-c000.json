The asymptotic\\nbehaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for these spacetimes is presented\\nunder certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism.\\nThe memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the polyhomogeneous\\nspacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the\\nlogarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains unchanged as\\nthe one of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of\\n1/r.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:14:25Z\"}"}
