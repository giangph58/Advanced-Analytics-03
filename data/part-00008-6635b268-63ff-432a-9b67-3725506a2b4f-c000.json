{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05765v1\", \"title\": \"Probabilistic Process Discovery with Stochastic Process Trees\", \"summary\": \"In order to obtain a stochastic model that accounts for the stochastic\\naspects of the dynamics of a business process, usually the following steps are\\ntaken. Given an event log, a process tree is obtained through a process\\ndiscovery algorithm, i.e., a process tree that is aimed at reproducing, as\\naccurately as possible, the language of the log. The process tree is then\\ntransformed into a Petri net that generates the same set of sequences as the\\nprocess tree. In order to capture the frequency of the sequences in the event\\nlog, weights are assigned to the transitions of the Petri net, resulting in a\\nstochastic Petri net with a stochastic language in which each sequence is\\nassociated with a probability. In this paper we show that this procedure has\\nunfavorable properties. First, the weights assigned to the transitions of the\\nPetri net have an unclear role in the resulting stochastic language. We will\\nshow that a weight can have multiple, ambiguous impact on the probability of\\nthe sequences generated by the Petri net. Second, a number of different Petri\\nnets with different number of transitions can correspond to the same process\\ntree. This means that the number of parameters (the number of weights) that\\ndetermines the stochastic language is not well-defined. In order to avoid these\\nambiguities, in this paper, we propose to add stochasticity directly to process\\ntrees. The result is a new formalism, called stochastic process trees, in which\\nthe number of parameters and their role in the associated stochastic language\\nis clear and well-defined.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:46:06Z\"}"}
