By\\nleveraging the problem structure, we apply the Douglas-Rachford splitting,\\nwhich generates a solution algorithm with linear convergence rate. The fast\\nconvergence of the method enables receding-horizon control architectures.\\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the associated VI admits a closed-form\\nsolution within a neighborhood of the attractor, thus allowing for a further\\nreduction in computation time. Finally, we benchmark the proposed method via\\nnumerical experiments in an automated driving application.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:38:27Z\"}"}
