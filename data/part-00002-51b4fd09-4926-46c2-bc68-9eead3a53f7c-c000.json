The motion of $\\\\mathscr S$ is driven by the uniform\\nflow of the liquid, far away from the body, characterized by a time-periodic\\nvelocity field, $\\\\mathbf{V}$, of frequency $f$. We show that the corresponding\\nset of governing equations always possesses a time-periodic weak solution of\\nthe same frequency $f$, whatever $f>0$, the magnitude of $\\\\mathbf{V}$ and the\\nvalues of physical parameters. Moreover, we show that the amplitude of linear\\nand rotational displacement is always pointwise in time uniformly bounded by\\none and the same constant depending on the data, regardless of whether $f$ is\\nor is not close to a natural frequency of the structure. Thus, our result rules\\nout the occurrence of resonant phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:09:14Z\"}"}
