While previous studies have emphasized the\\nimportance of technical indicators and feature engineering, we show that a\\nsimple LSTM network trained on raw OHLCV data alone can match the performance\\nof sophisticated ML models that incorporate technical indicators. Using a\\ndataset of Korean stocks from 2006 to 2024, we optimize the triple barrier\\nlabeling parameters to achieve balanced label proportions with a 29-day window\\nand 9\\\\% barriers. Our experiments reveal that LSTM networks achieve similar\\nperformance to traditional machine learning models like XGBoost, despite using\\nonly raw OHLCV data without any technical indicators. Furthermore, we identify\\nthat the optimal window size varies with model hidden size, with a\\nconfiguration of window size 100 and hidden size 8 yielding the best\\nperformance. Additionally, our results confirm that using full OHLCV data\\nprovides better predictive accuracy compared to using only close price or close\\nprice with volume. These findings challenge conventional approaches to feature\\nengineering in financial forecasting and suggest that simpler approaches\\nfocusing on raw data and appropriate model selection may be more effective than\\ncomplex feature engineering strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:30:50Z\"}"}
