In this paper we have\\nconsidered two special two qutrit entangled states, which belong to $SU(3)$\\ngroup, as useful resources for teleportation. For the successful teleportation,\\nthese entangled states have been chosen as quantum channels shared between\\nAlice and Bob. Another entangled basis of two qutrit states have been used as\\nauxiliary states, which would help Alice to manipulate with her channel so that\\nthe single qutrit she holds can be successfully teleported to Bob. Bob's\\nchoices of measurement operators influence the retrieval of Alice's single\\nqutrit.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:58:23Z\"}"}
