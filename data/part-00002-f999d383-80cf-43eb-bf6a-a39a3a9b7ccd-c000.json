This survey provides a\\ncomprehensive review of the evolution of ISAC over the years. We examine the\\nexpansion of the spectrum across RF and optical ISAC, highlighting the role of\\nadvanced technologies, along with key challenges and synergies. We further\\ndiscuss the advancements in network architecture from single-cell to multi-cell\\nsystems, emphasizing the integration of collaborative sensing and interference\\nmitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyze the progress from single-modal to\\nmulti-modal sensing, with a focus on the integration of edge intelligence to\\nenable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance decision-making.\\nFinally, we extensively review standardization efforts by 3GPP, IEEE, and ITU,\\nexamining the transition of ISAC-related technologies and their implications\\nfor the deployment of 6G networks.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:42:58Z\"}"}
