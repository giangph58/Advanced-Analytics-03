We express the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative\\nof the pressure with respect to the chemical potential by bypassing the\\nsolution of the PB equation. The screening parameter consists of two parts. The\\nfirst part is composed of the Debye length evaluated with effective charges of\\nthe ions and the macroions, and the second term corresponds to the macroion\\nsurface dissociation equilibrium that shows an interesting screening resonance\\nbehavior. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of local variables on screening\\nand show that the CR macroions themselves provide a screening mechanism despite\\nthe low concentration of free ions. Our findings may shed new light on\\nproteins, protein-membrane, and charged nanoparticles with dissociable surface\\ngroups in their bathing solution.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:33:17Z\"}"}
