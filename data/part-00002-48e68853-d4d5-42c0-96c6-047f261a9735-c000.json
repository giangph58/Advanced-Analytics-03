{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04759v1\", \"title\": \"Taming Flat Bands with Breathing Superlattices\", \"summary\": \"Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and\\nphotonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of\\nstates. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat\\nbands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both\\nthe number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously\\ntailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the\\nmomentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them\\nrobust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish\\na duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D\\nHarper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the\\ndifferent orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof\\nof concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally\\ndemonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize\\nour scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and\\ndiscuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on\\nthe manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable\\nbandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:14:26Z\"}"}
