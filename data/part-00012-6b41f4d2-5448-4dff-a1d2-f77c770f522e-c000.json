{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01409v1\", \"title\": \"Pedestrian-Aware Motion Planning for Autonomous Driving in Complex Urban\\n  Scenarios\", \"summary\": \"Motion planning in uncertain environments like complex urban areas is a key\\nchallenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The aim of our research is to\\ninvestigate how AVs can navigate crowded, unpredictable scenarios with multiple\\npedestrians while maintaining a safe and efficient vehicle behavior. So far,\\nmost research has concentrated on static or deterministic traffic participant\\nbehavior. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for motion planning in\\ncrowded spaces by combining social force principles for simulating realistic\\npedestrian behavior with a risk-aware motion planner. We evaluate this new\\nalgorithm in a 2D simulation environment to rigorously assess AV-pedestrian\\ninteractions, demonstrating that our algorithm enables safe, efficient, and\\nadaptive motion planning, particularly in highly crowded urban environments - a\\nfirst in achieving this level of performance. This study has not taken into\\nconsideration real-time constraints and has been shown only in simulation so\\nfar. Further studies are needed to investigate the novel algorithm in a\\ncomplete software stack for AVs on real cars to investigate the entire\\nperception, planning and control pipeline in crowded scenarios. We release the\\ncode developed in this research as an open-source resource for further studies\\nand development.
