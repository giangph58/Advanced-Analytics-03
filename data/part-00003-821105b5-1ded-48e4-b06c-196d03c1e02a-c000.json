{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07733v1\", \"title\": \"DeepGreen: Effective LLM-Driven Green-washing Monitoring System Designed\\n  for Empirical Testing -- Evidence from China\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes DeepGreen, an Large Language Model Driven (LLM-Driven)\\nsystem for detecting corporate green-washing behaviour. Utilizing dual-layer\\nLLM analysis, DeepGreen preliminarily identifies potential green keywords in\\nfinancial statements and then assesses their implementation degree via\\niterative semantic analysis of LLM. A core variable GreenImplement is derived\\nfrom the ratio from the two layers' output. We extract 204 financial statements\\nof 68 companies from A-share market over three years, comprising 89,893 words,\\nand analyse them through DeepGreen. Our analysis, supported by violin plots and\\nK-means clustering, reveals insights and validates the variable against the\\nHuazheng ESG rating. It offers a novel perspective for regulatory agencies and\\ninvestors, serving as a proactive monitoring tool that complements traditional\\nmethods.Empirical tests show that green implementation can significantly boost\\nthe asset return rate of companies, but there is heterogeneity in scale. Small\\nand medium-sized companies have limited contribution to asset return via green\\nimplementation, so there is a stronger motivation for green-washing.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:29:07Z\"}"}
