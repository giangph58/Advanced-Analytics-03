{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v1\", \"title\": \"MRD-RAG: Enhancing Medical Diagnosis with Multi-Round\\n  Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language\\nmodels (LLMs) has become a significant trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented\\ngeneration (RAG) has garnered significant attention due to its features of\\nrapid deployment and privacy protection. However, existing medical RAG\\nframeworks still have shortcomings. Most existing medical RAG frameworks are\\ndesigned for single-round question answering tasks and are not suitable for\\nmulti-round diagnostic dialogue. On the other hand, existing medical\\nmulti-round RAG frameworks do not consider the interconnections between\\npotential diseases to inquire precisely like a doctor. To address these issues,\\nwe propose a Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework that mimics the\\ndoctor's diagnostic process. This RAG framework can analyze diagnosis\\ninformation of potential diseases and accurately conduct multi-round diagnosis\\nlike a doctor. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks, we\\nconduct experiments on two modern medical datasets and two traditional Chinese\\nmedicine datasets, with evaluations by GPT and human doctors on different\\nmethods. The results indicate that our RAG framework can significantly enhance\\nthe diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of our approach\\nin medical diagnosis. The code and data can be found in our project website\\nhttps://github.com/YixiangCh/MRD-RAG/tree/master.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:17:51Z\"}"}
