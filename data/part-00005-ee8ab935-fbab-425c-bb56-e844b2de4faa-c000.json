Under the framework of the level\\nset analysis by De Giorgi, we derive an $L^\\\\infty$ estimate which is uniform\\nwith respect to the quantum parameter $\\\\varepsilon$. All quantitative estimates\\nare independent of $\\\\varepsilon$, which implies that they also hold in the\\nclassical limit, i.e., the Boltzmann equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:10:34Z\"}"}
