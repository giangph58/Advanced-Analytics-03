In this work, we introduce\\ntessellated spatial regression, a novel framework that extends segmented\\nregression models to spatial point processes, with the aim of detecting abrupt\\nchanges in the effect of external covariates onto the process intensity.\\n  Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we apply a spatial\\nsegmentation algorithm to geographically weighted regression estimates,\\ngenerating different tessellations that partition the study area into regions\\nwhere model parameters can be assumed constant. Next, we fit log-linear Poisson\\nmodels in which covariates interact with the tessellations, enabling\\nregion-specific parameter estimation and classical inferential procedures, such\\nas hypothesis testing on regression coefficients.\\n  Unlike geographically weighted regression, our approach allows for discrete\\nchanges in regression coefficients, making it possible to capture abrupt\\nspatial variations in the effect of real-valued spatial covariates.\\nFurthermore, the method naturally addresses the problem of locating and\\nquantifying the number of detected spatial changes.\\n  We validate our methodology through simulation studies and applications to\\ntwo examples where a model with region-wise parameters seems appropriate and to\\nan environmental dataset of earthquake occurrences in Greece.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:23:32Z\"}"}
