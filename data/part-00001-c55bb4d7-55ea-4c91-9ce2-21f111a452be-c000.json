We first derive a priori $C^2$ estimates for $(k-1)$-admissible\\nsolutions in almost convex and uniformly $(k-1)$-convex domains, and prove the\\nexistence of admissible solutions via the method of continuity. Furthermore, we\\nobtain existence results for the classical Neumann problem in uniformly convex\\ndomains. Finally, we extend these results to the corresponding parabolic\\nproblems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:50:00Z\"}"}
