It arises from\\nFerapontov and Kruglikov's investigation on the integrability of several\\ndispersionless partial differential equations and the geometry of their formal\\nlinearizations. First, by using Manakov-Santini IST (inverse spectral\\ntransform) method, we investigate its Cauchy problem including the direct\\nproblem from the initial data, the time evolution of the scattering and\\nspectral data, and the inverse problem. Second, based on the nonlinear RH\\n(Riemann-Hilbert) dressing, the longtime behaviour of the solutions is\\nconstructed. In addition, some implicit solutions are presented.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:08:35Z\"}"}
