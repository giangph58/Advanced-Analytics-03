{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02763v1\", \"title\": \"CanonNet: Canonical Ordering and Curvature Learning for Point Cloud\\n  Analysis\", \"summary\": \"Point cloud processing poses two fundamental challenges: establishing\\nconsistent point ordering and effectively learning fine-grained geometric\\nfeatures. Current architectures rely on complex operations that limit\\nexpressivity while struggling to capture detailed surface geometry. We present\\nCanonNet, a lightweight neural network composed of two complementary\\ncomponents: (1) a preprocessing pipeline that creates a canonical point\\nordering and orientation, and (2) a geometric learning framework where networks\\nlearn from synthetic surfaces with precise curvature values. This modular\\napproach eliminates the need for complex transformation-invariant architectures\\nwhile effectively capturing local geometric properties. Our experiments\\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance in curvature estimation and\\ncompetitive results in geometric descriptor tasks with significantly fewer\\nparameters (\\\\textbf{100X}) than comparable methods. CanonNet's efficiency makes\\nit particularly suitable for real-world applications where computational\\nresources are limited, demonstrating that mathematical preprocessing can\\neffectively complement neural architectures for point cloud analysis.
