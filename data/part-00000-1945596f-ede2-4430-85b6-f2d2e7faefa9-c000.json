The Berry\\nphase accumulated by the fermionic vacuum is given by $\\\\Delta \\\\alpha =\\n\\\\oint_{\\\\mathcal{C}} \\\\gamma_5\\\\, \\\\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$, where $\\\\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$ is\\na closed but non-exact one-form defined over the space of gauge configurations.\\nThis chiral holonomy induces an emergent vacuum angle that contributes\\nnon-perturbatively to the effective action. The partition function decomposes\\ninto topological sectors weighted by this geometric phase, analogous to quantum\\nsystems on multiply connected spaces. Our results reveal that even in Abelian\\ngauge theory, the infrared regime can exhibit global effects beyond the reach\\nof local or perturbative descriptions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:13:08Z\"}"}
