This is achieved by providing\\na general reduction algorithm for graphs with QHD smoothings, and enumeration.\\nNew examples and families are presented, which admit a combinatorial QHD\\nsmoothing, i.e. the incidence relations for a sandwich presentation can be\\nsatisfied. We also give a new proof of the Bhupal-Stipsicz theorem on the\\nclassification of weighted homogeneous singularities admitting QHD smoothings\\nwith this method by using cusp singularities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:36:41Z\"}"}
