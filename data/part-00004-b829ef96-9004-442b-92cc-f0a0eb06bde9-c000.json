Instead, one may set a\\nmore modest goal of approaching the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues,\\nrecovering the overall shape of the eigenspectrum. Current approaches to\\nspectral estimation typically work with \\\\emph{moments} of the spectral\\ndistribution. These moments are first estimated using Monte Carlo trace\\nestimators, then the estimates are combined to approximate the spectral\\ndensity. In this article we show how \\\\emph{Kirchhoff forests}, which are random\\nforests on graphs, can be used to estimate certain non-linear moments of very\\nlarge graph Laplacians. We show how to combine these moments into an estimate\\nof the spectral density. If the estimate's desired precision isn't too high,\\nour approach paves the way to the estimation of a graph's spectrum in time\\nsublinear in the number of links.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:47:55Z\"}"}
