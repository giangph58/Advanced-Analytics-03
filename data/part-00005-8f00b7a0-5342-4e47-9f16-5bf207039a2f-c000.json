We have\\norganized the FinRL Contests 2023-2025 featuring different financial tasks.\\nLarge language models have a strong capability to process financial texts.\\nIntegrating LLM-generated signals into FinRL is a new task, enabling agents to\\nuse both structured market data and unstructured financial text. To address the\\nsampling bottleneck during training, we introduce GPU-based parallel market\\nenvironments to improve sampling speed. In this paper, we summarize the\\nparallel market environments used in FinRL Contests 2023-2025. Two new\\nenvironments incorporate LLM-generated signals and support massively parallel\\nsimulation. Contestants utilize these environments to train agents for stock\\nand cryptocurrency trading tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:08:04Z\"}"}
