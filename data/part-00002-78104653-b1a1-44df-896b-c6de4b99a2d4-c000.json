{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06827v1\", \"title\": \"IAAO: Interactive Affordance Learning for Articulated Objects in 3D\\n  Environments\", \"summary\": \"This work presents IAAO, a novel framework that builds an explicit 3D model\\nfor intelligent agents to gain understanding of articulated objects in their\\nenvironment through interaction. Unlike prior methods that rely on\\ntask-specific networks and assumptions about movable parts, our IAAO leverages\\nlarge foundation models to estimate interactive affordances and part\\narticulations in three stages. We first build hierarchical features and label\\nfields for each object state using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by distilling\\nmask features and view-consistent labels from multi-view images. We then\\nperform object- and part-level queries on the 3D Gaussian primitives to\\nidentify static and articulated elements, estimating global transformations and\\nlocal articulation parameters along with affordances. Finally, scenes from\\ndifferent states are merged and refined based on the estimated transformations,\\nenabling robust affordance-based interaction and manipulation of objects.\\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:36:48Z\"}"}
