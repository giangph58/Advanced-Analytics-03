This result is\\nbased on a generalization of the $T'$-expansion scheme, thanks to which the\\ndiagonal $\\\\mu_B$ extrapolation was pushed up to a baryo-chemical potential\\n$\\\\mu_B/T \\\\sim 3.5$ for the first time. This considerably extended the coverage\\nof the Taylor expansion, limited to $\\\\mu_B/T < 2.5-3$. As a consequence, we are\\nable to offer a substantially larger coverage of the four-dimensional QCD phase\\ndiagram as well, compared to previously available Taylor expansion results. Our\\nresults are based on new continuum estimated lattice results on the full set of\\nsecond and fourth order fluctuations.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:39:57Z\"}"}
