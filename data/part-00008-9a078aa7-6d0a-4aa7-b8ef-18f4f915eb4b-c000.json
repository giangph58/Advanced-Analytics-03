There are two\\ncritical contributions of this work. One is on the scalable analytical pathway\\nfor verifying the concept of resonant substructure as the basis of the ideal\\nvibration absorption. The second is to experimentally validate the spatial and\\nspectral tunability of NCVA structures for the first time. For both novelties\\narbitrarily large dimensions of interconnected mass-spring-damper chains are\\nconsidered. Following the state of the art on NCVA, control synthesis is\\nperformed over the resonant substructure comprising the delayed resonator and a\\npart of the primary structure involved in the vibration absorption. The\\nexperimental validation of the proposed NCVA concept is performed on a\\nmechatronic setup with three interconnected cart-bodies. Based on the spectral\\nanalysis, an excitation frequency is selected for which a stable vibration\\nsuppression can be achieved sequentially for all the three bodies, one\\ncollocated and two non-collocated. The experimental results closely match the\\nsimulations for complete vibration suppression at the targeted bodies, and thus\\nvalidating the crucial spatial tunability characteristic as well as the\\ntraditional spectral tuning.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:18:20Z\"}"}
