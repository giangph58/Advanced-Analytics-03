We propose a straightforward generalization of the\\nwell-established System $F^\\\\omega$ to implicit parameters, with a uniform\\ntreatment of type and term abstractions. Unlike previous works, we give a\\ndeclarative specification of unambiguous, and thus coherent, resolution without\\nintroducing restrictions motivated by an algorithmic formulation of resolution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.PL\", \"categories\": \"cs.PL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:54:32Z\"}"}
