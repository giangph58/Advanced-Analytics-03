A central\\naspect of our analysis is the spectral equivalence of the linearized operators\\nunder Lorentz transformations in self-similar variables. This observation\\nserves as a useful tool in proving mode stability and provides insights that\\nmay aid the study of self-similar solutions in related problems. As a direct\\nconsequence, we establish the asymptotic stability of the ODE blow-up family,\\nextending the classical results of Merle and Zaag [Merle-Zaag, 2007, 2016] to\\nthe superconformal case and generalizing the recent findings of Ostermann\\n[Ostermann, 2024] to include the entire ODE blow-up family.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:07:19Z\"}"}
