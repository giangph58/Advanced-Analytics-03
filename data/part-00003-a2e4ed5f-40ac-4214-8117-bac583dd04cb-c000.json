The time-dependent coefficient on the\\nrepulsive term decays as the inverse square of time, which is the threshold\\nbetween the standard free Schroedinger operator and the time-independent\\nrepulsive Hamiltonian. Applying the Enss-Weder time-dependent method, we can\\ndetermine uniquely the short-range potential functions with Coulomb-like\\nsingularities from the velocity limit of the scattering operator.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:10:04Z\"}"}
