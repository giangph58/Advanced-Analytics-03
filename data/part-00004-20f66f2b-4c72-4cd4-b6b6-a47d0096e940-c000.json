This necessitates the use of cryptographic\\nhardware accelerators. We propose a high-performance unified elliptic curve\\ncryptography accelerator supporting NIST standard Montgomery curves Curve25519\\nand Curve448 at 128-bit and 224-bit security levels respectively. Our\\naccelerator implements extensive parallel processing of Karatsuba-style\\nlarge-integer multiplications, restructures arithmetic operations in the\\nMontgomery Ladder and exploits special mathematical properties of the\\nunderlying pseudo-Mersenne and Solinas prime fields for optimized performance.\\nOur design ensures efficient resource sharing across both curve computations\\nand also incorporates several standard side-channel countermeasures. Our ASIC\\nimplementation achieves record performance and energy of 10.38 $\\\\mu$s / 54.01\\n$\\\\mu$s and 0.72 $\\\\mu$J / 3.73 $\\\\mu$J respectively for Curve25519 / Curve448,\\nwhich is significantly better than state-of-the-art.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:04:02Z\"}"}
