In fact, any weak\\nperturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state,\\nproviding a sensitive probe for such a perturbation. Here we consider a cavity\\noptomechanical setup and the case of the detection of a weak mechanical\\nnonlinearity. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the\\nstationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and\\nthen focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be\\nsuccessfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities, or\\neffective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:42:48Z\"}"}
