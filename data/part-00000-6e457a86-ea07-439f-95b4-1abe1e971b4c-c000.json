CAD decomposes\\nspace into `cells' where input polynomials are sign-invariant. This package\\ncomputes an Open CAD (full-dimensional cells only) for sets of real polynomials\\nwith rational coefficients, enabling users to solve existential problems\\ninvolving strict inequalities. With the construction of a full CAD (cells of\\nall dimensions), this tool could be extended to solve any real quantifier\\nelimination problem. The current implementation employs the Lazard projection\\nand introduces a new heuristic for choosing the variable ordering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SC\", \"categories\": \"cs.SC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:46:24Z\"}"}
