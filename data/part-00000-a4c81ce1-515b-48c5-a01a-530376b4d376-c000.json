Thanks to the\\nImaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), it is now possible to evaluate the\\ndegree of X-ray polarization in sources such as supernova remnants (SNRs).\\nJointly using IXPE data and high-resolution Chandra observations, we perform a\\nspatially resolved spectropolarimetric analysis of SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We\\nfocus in the 3-6 keV energy band on regions near the shell dominated by\\nnonthermal synchrotron emission. By combining IXPE's polarization sensitivity\\nwith Chandra's higher spatial and spectral resolution, we constrain the local\\npolarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) across the remnant. Our\\nanalysis reveals PD values ranging locally from 10% to 26%, showing significant\\nregional variations that underscore the complex magnetic field morphology of\\nCas A. The polarization vectors indicate a predominantly radial magnetic field,\\nconsistent with previous studies. Thanks to the improved modeling of thermal\\ncontamination using Chandra data, we retrieve higher PD values compared to\\nearlier IXPE analysis and more significant detections with respect to the\\nstandard IXPEOBSSIM analysis. Finally, we also estimate the degree of magnetic\\nturbulence {\\\\eta} from the measured photon index and PD, under the assumption\\nof an isotropic fluctuating field across the shell of Cas A.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:11:06Z\"}"}
