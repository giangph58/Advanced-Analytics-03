{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02285v1\", \"title\": \"Tree-based Models for Vertical Federated Learning: A Survey\", \"summary\": \"Tree-based models have achieved great success in a wide range of real-world\\napplications due to their effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability,\\nwhich inspired people to apply them in vertical federated learning (VFL)\\nscenarios in recent years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to\\ngive an overall picture of applying tree-based models in VFL, from the\\nperspective of their communication and computation protocols. We categorize\\ntree-based models in VFL into two types, i.e., feature-gathering models and\\nlabel-scattering models, and provide a detailed discussion regarding their\\ncharacteristics, advantages, privacy protection mechanisms, and applications.\\nThis study also focuses on the implementation of tree-based models in VFL,\\nsummarizing several design principles for better satisfying various\\nrequirements from both academic research and industrial deployment. We conduct\\na series of experiments to provide empirical observations on the differences\\nand advances of different types of tree-based models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:16:09Z\"}"}
