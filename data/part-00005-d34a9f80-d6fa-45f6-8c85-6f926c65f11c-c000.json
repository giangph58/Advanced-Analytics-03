We prove that this space is Banach isomorphic to the\\nspace of Bowen functions corresponding to the associated Gromov geodesic flow,\\nmodulo a weak notion of Livsic cohomology.\\n  The results include that each such unbounded quasi-morphism is associated\\nwith a unique invariant measure for the flow, and this measure uniquely\\ncharacterizes the cohomology class. As a consequence, we establish the Central\\nLimit Theorem for any unbounded quasi-morphism with respect to Markov measures,\\nthe invariance principle, and the Bernoulli property of the associated\\nequilibrium state.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:59:30Z\"}"}
