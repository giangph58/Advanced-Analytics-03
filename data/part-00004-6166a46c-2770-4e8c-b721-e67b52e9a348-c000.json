{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178v1\", \"title\": \"Beijing Normal University 12 meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector\\n  Prototype\", \"summary\": \"Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe,\\nenabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise\\nobscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have\\npredominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the\\nhigh-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains\\nunderexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact\\nbinary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources.\\nIn this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a\\npioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter\\nL-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is\\ndesigned to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges\\nfor kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed\\nand demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for\\nits own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to\\nexplore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and\\ngeontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the\\nBNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,astro-ph.IM,gr-qc,physics.ins-det,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:54:53Z\"}"}
