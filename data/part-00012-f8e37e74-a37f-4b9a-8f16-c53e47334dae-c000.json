Coding is highly\\nlabor intensive, making it infeasible for most researchers to conduct\\nexhaustive thematic analyses of large corpora. We utilize few-shot prompting\\nwith higher quality codes generated on semantically similar passages to enhance\\nthe quality of the codes while utilizing a cheap, more easily scalable model.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:02:15Z\"}"}
