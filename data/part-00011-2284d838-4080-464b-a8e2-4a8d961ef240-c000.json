However, the\\norigin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self organization\\ntowards criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure\\nof the fluctuations spectrum can be interpreted as an effect of inertia. The\\ngeneral insight is that inertial dynamics can become a crucial player when the\\nunderlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the\\npossibility of inertia-induced criticality using an elementary example of mass\\npoints connected by bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia\\nin the fully realistic two and three dimensional continuum models of specific\\nelastic phase transitions in crystals.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:18:20Z\"}"}
