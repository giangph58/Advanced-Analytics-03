However, not all of these\\nstart-ups have succeeded due to various reasons, among others, not being able\\nto establish a large enough customer base. In this paper, we address this\\nproblem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish\\nthemselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited\\nfleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the\\nfleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and\\nin turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each\\narea. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand\\ndevelopment. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time\\nfulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach. First, we derive\\nanalytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem.\\nSecond, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement\\nlearning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment. Our experiments\\ndemonstrate that combining operational efficiency with long-term strategic\\nplanning is highly advantageous. Further, we show that the careful shaping of\\ntraining data is essential for the successful development of demand.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:25:37Z\"}"}
