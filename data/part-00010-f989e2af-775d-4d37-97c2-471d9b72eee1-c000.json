{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06724v1\", \"title\": \"End-to-end design framework for compressed on-chip pixel-wise\\n  spectro-polarimeters\", \"summary\": \"Modern detector manufacturing allows spectral and polarimetric filters to be\\ndirectly integrated on top of separate detector pixels. This enables the\\ncreation of CubeSat-sized spectro-polarimetric instruments that are not much\\nlarger than the detector and a lens. Redundancy inherent to the observed scene,\\noffers the opportunity for sparse sampling in the form of not scanning all\\nfilters at every location. However, when there are fewer pushbroom steps than\\nfilters, data are missing in the resulting data cube. The missing, largely\\nredundant data can be filled in with interpolation methods, often called\\ndemosaicers. The choice of filters and their precise layout influences the\\nperformance of the instrument after the demosaicing process. In these\\nproceedings we describe a part of a design toolbox for both the filter layout\\nand the optimum parameters for the reconstruction to a full\\nspectro-polarimetric data cube. The design tool is based on training a (neural)\\nnetwork and jointly updating the values of the filters and demosaicer. We\\noptimized a filter layout by training on spectro-polarimetric remote\\nobservations of the Earth acquired by SPEX airborne. This optimised filter\\nlayout could reconstruct a validation scene from five overlapping snapshots\\n(pushbroom steps), which would take 109 pushbroom steps when measuring with a\\nclassical layout and no reconstruction.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:29:30Z\"}"}
