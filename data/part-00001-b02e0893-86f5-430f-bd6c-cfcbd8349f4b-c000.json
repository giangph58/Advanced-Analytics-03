Initially, the raw one-dimensional acceleration signals collected\\nfrom the gearbox base using vibration sensors undergo pre-segmentation\\nprocessing. The Gabor-ASTFT and DTCWT are then applied to convert the original\\none-dimensional time-domain signals into two-dimensional time-frequency\\nrepresentations, facilitating the preliminary extraction of fault features and\\nobtaining weak feature maps.Subsequently, a dual-channel structure is\\nestablished using deconvolution and dilated convolution to perform upsampling\\nand downsampling on the feature maps, adjusting their sizes accordingly. A\\nfeature fusion layer is then constructed to integrate the dual-channel\\nfeatures, enabling multi-scale analysis of the extracted fault\\nfeatures.Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a\\nresidual structure is developed to conduct deep feature extraction from the\\nfused feature maps. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a Global\\nAverage Pooling(GAP) and a classification function for fault classification.\\nConducting comparative experiments on different datasets, the proposed method\\nis demonstrated to effectively meet the requirements of end-to-end fault\\ndiagnosis for gears.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:40:06Z\"}"}
