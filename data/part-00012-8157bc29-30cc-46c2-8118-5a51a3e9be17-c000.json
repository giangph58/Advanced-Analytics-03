Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of\\nparticle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision\\nmeasurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue\\nto lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out\\ndetailed simulations for the process $pp \\\\to \\\\tau^+\\\\tau^- X$ to perform quantum\\ntomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of\\nthe $\\\\tau^+\\\\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic\\nuncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino\\nmomentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin\\ndensity matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by\\nreconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear\\nobservation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing\\n5$\\\\sigma$, establishing $\\\\tau^+ \\\\tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum\\ninformation studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental\\nfeasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose\\nthat $\\\\tau^+ \\\\tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum\\ninformation studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained\\nfrom the $t\\\\bar{t}$ system.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:48:10Z\"}"}
