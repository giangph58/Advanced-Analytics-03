However, previous methods still struggled to effectively handle\\nforged images processed with diverse forgery operations in real-world\\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Multi-teacher Knowledge\\nDistillation (Re-MTKD) framework for the IFDL task, structured around an\\nencoder-decoder \\\\textbf{C}onvNeXt-\\\\textbf{U}perNet along with\\n\\\\textbf{E}dge-Aware Module, named Cue-Net. First, three Cue-Net models are\\nseparately trained for the three main types of image forgeries, i.e.,\\ncopy-move, splicing, and inpainting, which then serve as the multi-teacher\\nmodels to train the target student model with Cue-Net through self-knowledge\\ndistillation. A Reinforced Dynamic Teacher Selection (Re-DTS) strategy is\\ndeveloped to dynamically assign weights to the involved teacher models, which\\nfacilitates specific knowledge transfer and enables the student model to\\neffectively learn both the common and specific natures of diverse tampering\\ntraces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared with other\\nstate-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves superior performance on\\nseveral recently emerged datasets comprised of various kinds of image\\nforgeries.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:12:05Z\"}"}
