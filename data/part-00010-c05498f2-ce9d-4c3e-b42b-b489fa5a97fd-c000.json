We prove that in both the set\\ncovered by the balls (the occupied set) and its complement (the vacant set),\\none cannot distinguish unbounded components from each other by any isometry\\ninvariant component property. This implies the uniqueness monotonicity for the\\noccupied and vacant sets of Poisson-Boolean models and an equivalence of\\nnon-uniqueness to the decay of connectivity for both sets. These results are\\ncontinuum analogues of those by Lyons and Schramm arXiv:math/9811170. However,\\nunlike the proof of the indistinguishability in arXiv:math/9811170, our proof\\ndoes not rely on transience of unbounded components. We also prove the\\nexistence of a percolation phase transition for independent Poisson-Boolean\\nmodel on unbounded connected components of both occupied and vacant sets and\\nshow transience of a random walk on the occupied set. Apart from some technical\\ndifferences, we treat the occupied and the vacant sets of Boolean models within\\na single framework.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:51:14Z\"}"}
