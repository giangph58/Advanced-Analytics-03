For the universal representation of inverse Radon\\ntransform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function\\nwithout the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this\\ninhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra\\ncontributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the\\noutset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the\\ncorresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be\\napplied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate\\nthe angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of\\noutset function and its Radon image.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,hep-ph,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:54:46Z\"}"}
