We find that the AC\\nsusceptibility forms only a part of the $q^2$ -- where $q$ is the wavevector of\\nthe applied field -- effective conductivity tensor, and many additional\\nresponse tensors characterizing both electric and magnetic multipole moments\\nresponse to electromagnetic fields and their derivatives must be included to\\ncreate the full gauge-invariant response. As was seen with the DC magnetic\\nsusceptibility and optical activity (characterized by the linear in $q$\\ncontribution to the conductivity) one must be careful with the diagonal\\nelements of the Berry connection. To our knowledge this is the only derivation\\nof such a result general for crystalline insulators, with both `atomic like'\\ncontributions and `itinerant contributions' due to overlap of atomic orbitals\\nand non-flat bands. Additionally, quantities familiar from quantum geometry\\nlike the Berry connection, curvature, and quantum metric appear extensively.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:09:18Z\"}"}
