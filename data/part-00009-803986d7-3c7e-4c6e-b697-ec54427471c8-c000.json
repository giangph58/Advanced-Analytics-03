{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06640v1\", \"title\": \"Design and use of devices to assist movement of the upper limb: review\\n  of the literature\", \"summary\": \"This article explores assistive devices for upper limb movement in people\\nwith disabilities through a systematic review based on the PRISMA methodology.\\nThe studied devices encompass technologies ranging from orthoses to advanced\\nrobotics, aiming to compensate for or supplement motor impairments. The results\\nhighlight the diversity of applications (rehabilitation, daily living\\nactivities), targeted body segments (distal, proximal, or global), as well as\\ncontrol mechanisms and interfaces used. However, despite the variety of\\npromising prototypes, few devices are commercially available, limiting their\\nreal impact on end users. Existing technologies, while effective in improving\\nfunctional autonomy and quality of life, still face challenges in terms of\\nergonomics, cost, and portability. In conclusion, this article emphasizes the\\nimportance of a user-centered approach and proposes avenues for the development\\nof innovative, modular, and accessible assistive devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:32:02Z\"}"}
