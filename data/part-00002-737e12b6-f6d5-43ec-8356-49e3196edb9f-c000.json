A low energy EFT for $^{12}$C($\\\\alpha$,$\\\\gamma$)$^{16}$O at the\\nGamow-peak energy, $E_G=0.3$~MeV, is constructed, and the theory is first\\napplied to the study of elastic $\\\\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering at low energies.\\nThe effective range parameters are fitted to the precise phase shift data of\\nthe elastic scattering and the astrophysical $S_{E1}$ factor of the $E1$\\ntransition of $^{12}$C($\\\\alpha$,$\\\\gamma$)$^{16}$O at $E_G$ is estimated. For\\nthe study of the $E2$ transition of $^{12}$C($\\\\alpha$,$\\\\gamma$)$^{16}$O, we\\ndiscuss a difficulty to determine the asymptotic normalization coefficient\\n(ANC) of the subthreshold $2_1^+$ state of $^{16}$O from the elastic scattering\\ndata, and demonstrate the difficulty with the estimate of the astrophysical\\n$S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\\\\alpha$,$\\\\gamma$)$^{16}$O at $E_G$. We discuss the\\nuncertainty in the estimate of the $S$ factors at $E_G$ in the present\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:05:44Z\"}"}
