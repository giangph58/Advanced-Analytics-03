We\\napplied various techniques to investigate periodic signatures in the light\\ncurves, including the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet\\nZ-transform (WWZ), and REDFIT. The significance of the signals detected in LSP\\nand WWZ was assessed using two independent approaches: Monte Carlo simulations\\nand red noise modeling. Our analysis revealed a dominant peak in the\\n$\\\\gamma$-ray and optical light curves, with a significance level exceeding\\n3$\\\\sigma$ in both LSP and WWZ, consistently persisting throughout the\\nobservation period. Additionally, the REDFIT analysis confirmed the presence of\\na quasi-periodic signal at $\\\\sim$0.00134 $day^{-1}$ with a 99% confidence\\nthreshold. To explain the observed quasi-periodic variations in $\\\\gamma$-ray\\nand optical emissions, we explored various potential physical mechanisms. Our\\nanalysis suggests that the detected periodicity could originate from a\\nsupermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) system or the jet-induced orbital motion\\nwithin such a system. Based on variability characteristics, we estimated the\\nblack hole mass of ON 246. The study suggests that the mass lies within the\\nrange of approximately $(0.142 - 8.22) \\\\times 10^9 \\\\ M_{\\\\odot}$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:48:32Z\"}"}
