One notable visual art form is 3D Anamorphic\\nArt in which an ensemble of arbitrarily shaped 3D objects creates a realistic\\nand meaningful expression when observed from a particular viewpoint and loses\\nits coherence over the other viewpoints. In this work, we build on insights\\nfrom 3D Anamorphic Art to perform 3D object arrangement. We introduce RASP, a\\ndifferentiable-rendering-based framework to arrange arbitrarily shaped 3D\\nobjects within a bounded volume via shadow (or silhouette)-guided optimization\\nwith an aim of minimal inter-object spacing and near-maximal occupancy.\\nFurthermore, we propose a novel SDF-based formulation to handle inter-object\\nintersection and container extrusion. We demonstrate that RASP can be extended\\nto part assembly alongside object packing considering 3D objects to be \\\"parts\\\"\\nof another 3D object. Finally, we present artistic illustrations of multi-view\\nanamorphic art, achieving meaningful expressions from multiple viewpoints\\nwithin a single ensemble.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:33:49Z\"}"}
