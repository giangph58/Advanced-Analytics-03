This novel technique can allow\\nauthors to reduce or eliminate publication charges for journals such as MNRAS\\nand ApJ. In order to offset publication costs entirely, we recommend that\\nauthors include anywhere from 200-700 corner plots per paper, with the exact\\nnumber depending on the journal used. Finally, we discuss other opportunities\\nto generate ad revenue through publications.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:02:37Z\"}"}
