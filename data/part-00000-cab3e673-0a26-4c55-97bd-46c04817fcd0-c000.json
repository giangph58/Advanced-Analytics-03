However, outside\\nof well-controlled systems producing either single-mode states (e.g. Fock\\nstates or squeezed states) or highly symmetric multi-mode states (e.g.\\nsuperradiant states), their potential for quantum advantage remains\\nuncharacterized. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze quantum\\nenhanced interferometry with general Markovian quantum light sources. First, we\\nshow how to compute the quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the photons emitted\\nby a source efficiently by just tracking its internal dynamics and without\\nexplicitly computing the state of the emitted photons. We then use this\\nrelationship to elucidate the connection between the level structure and\\nspectrum of the source to a potential quantum advantage in interferometry.\\nFinally, we analyze optimal measurement protocols that can be used to achieve\\nthis quantum advantage with experimentally available optical elements. In\\nparticular, we show that tunable optical elements with Kerr non-linearity can\\nalways be harnessed to implement the optimal measurement for any given source.\\nSimultaneously, we also outline general conditions under which linear optics\\nand photodetection is enough to implement the optimal measurement.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:15:36Z\"}"}
