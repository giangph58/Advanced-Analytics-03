This exponential sum was originally studied by\\nDavenport and he obtained an asymptotic bound of $x(\\\\log x)^{-A}$ for any\\n$A\\\\ge0$. Our bound depends on the irrationality exponent $\\\\eta$ of $\\\\alpha$. If\\n$\\\\eta \\\\le 5/2$, we obtain a bound of $x^{4/5 + \\\\varepsilon}$ and, when $\\\\eta\\n\\\\ge 5/2$, then our bound becomes $x^{(2\\\\eta-1)/2\\\\eta + \\\\varepsilon}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:31:12Z\"}"}
