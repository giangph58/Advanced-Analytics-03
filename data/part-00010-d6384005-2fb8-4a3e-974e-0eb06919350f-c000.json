We\\ncontinue searching for efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations of\\nthe form $P(X) = B$, with a constant side B, with the goal of decomposing\\ncomplex behaviors into simpler systems. Taking inspiration from the\\ncharacterization of injective polynomials P over dynamical systems, which is\\nbased on a condition on the lengths of limit cycles of their coefficients, we\\nintroduce a more general notion of pseudo-injectivity by relaxing this\\nconstraint. We prove that the associated equations can be solved efficiently,\\neven in certain cases where the input is encoded in an exponentially more\\ncompact way.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:49:39Z\"}"}
