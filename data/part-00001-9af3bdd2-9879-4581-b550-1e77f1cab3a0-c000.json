We discover a\\nnovel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range\\nRydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this\\nregime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite -\\neffective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization\\nfrom particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms\\nas tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics,\\nincluding quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:59:59Z\"}"}
