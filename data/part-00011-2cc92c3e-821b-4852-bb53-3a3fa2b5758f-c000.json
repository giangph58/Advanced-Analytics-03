In this study, we\\naim to validate the effectiveness of a previously established chiral two-body\\nmodel for simulating bacterial Brownian motion, which simplifies the helical\\nflagellum to a chiral body. We systematically investigate bacterial motion\\nusing the chiral two-body model, resistive force theory, and twin multipole\\nmoment. We validate the effectiveness of the model by comparing the standard\\ndeviations of the flagellar random velocities obtained from different methods.\\nThe analytical solutions for the velocities, the thrust, and torque exerted by\\nthe motor on the cell body are derived from the chiral two-body model during\\nbacterial non-Brownian motion. We characterize the shape and symmetry of the\\ntrajectories through the eigenvalues of the radius of gyration tensor, describe\\ntheir linearity employing the directionality ratio, and evaluate the stability\\nof forward direction using the average orientation. We conclude that\\nappropriately increasing the helix radius and the contour length of the\\nflagellum can elongate trajectories and enhance linearity. In addition, the\\nlonger contour length increases the average orientation, thereby enhancing the\\nstability of the bacterial forward direction. This study further validates the\\neffectiveness of the chiral two-body model in simulating bacterial Brownian\\nmotion and indicates the importance of the flagellum in stabilizing bacterial\\nBrownian motion.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:21:39Z\"}"}
