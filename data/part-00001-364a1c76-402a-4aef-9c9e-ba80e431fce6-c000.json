{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06767v1\", \"title\": \"DIMA: DIffusing Motion Artifacts for unsupervised correction in brain\\n  MRI images\", \"summary\": \"Motion artifacts remain a significant challenge in Magnetic Resonance Imaging\\n(MRI), compromising diagnostic quality and potentially leading to misdiagnosis\\nor repeated scans. Existing deep learning approaches for motion artifact\\ncorrection typically require paired motion-free and motion-affected images for\\ntraining, which are rarely available in clinical settings. To overcome this\\nrequirement, we present DIMA (DIffusing Motion Artifacts), a novel framework\\nthat leverages diffusion models to enable unsupervised motion artifact\\ncorrection in brain MRI. Our two-phase approach first trains a diffusion model\\non unpaired motion-affected images to learn the distribution of motion\\nartifacts. This model then generates realistic motion artifacts on clean\\nimages, creating paired datasets suitable for supervised training of correction\\nnetworks. Unlike existing methods, DIMA operates without requiring k-space\\nmanipulation or detailed knowledge of MRI sequence parameters, making it\\nadaptable across different scanning protocols and hardware. Comprehensive\\nevaluations across multiple datasets and anatomical planes demonstrate that our\\nmethod achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised\\napproaches while offering superior generalizability to real clinical data. DIMA\\nrepresents a significant advancement in making motion artifact correction more\\naccessible for routine clinical use, potentially reducing the need for repeat\\nscans and improving diagnostic accuracy.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:43:38Z\"}"}
