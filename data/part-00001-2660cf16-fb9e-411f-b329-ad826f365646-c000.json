{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04808v1\", \"title\": \"ELT-Bench: An End-to-End Benchmark for Evaluating AI Agents on ELT\\n  Pipelines\", \"summary\": \"Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT)\\npipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses. However,\\ndesigning these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure\\ncorrectness. Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong\\ncapabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to\\nalleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines. Unfortunately, current\\nbenchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data\\ntools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in\\nevaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.\\n  To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to\\nassess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines. ELT-Bench consists\\nof 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across\\nvarious domains. By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of\\ndiverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI\\nagents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows. AI agents\\nmust interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and\\norchestrate every pipeline stage. We evaluate two representative code agent\\nframeworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) on ELT-Bench. The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent\\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data\\nmodels, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline. Our\\nexperimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the\\nneed for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.
