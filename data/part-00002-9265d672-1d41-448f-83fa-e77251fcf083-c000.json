At low temperatures, the primary source of error in these systems is\\npure dephasing, caused by their interactions with the bath of surrounding\\nnuclear spins degrees of freedom. Most importantly, as the system's\\ndimensionality grows going from qubits to qudits, the control and mitigation of\\ndecoherence becomes more challenging. Here we analyze the characteristics of\\npure dephasing in molecular qudits under spin-echo sequences. We use a\\nrealistic description of their interaction with the bath, whose non-Markovian\\ndynamics is accurately computed by the cluster correlation expansion technique.\\nFirst, we demonstrate a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent the decay\\nof coherence with time, also introducing a parameter to quantify the deviation\\nfrom such ideal condition. We illustrate this with two paradigmatic systems: a\\nsingle giant spin and a composite antiferromagnetic spin system. We then\\nadvance a proposal for optimized nanomagnets, identifying key ingredients for\\nengineering robust qudits for quantum technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:00:52Z\"}"}
