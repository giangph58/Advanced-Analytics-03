{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04968v1\", \"title\": \"The Dream Within Huang Long Cave: AI-Driven Interactive Narrative for\\n  Family Storytelling and Emotional Reflection\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces the art project The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, an\\nAI-driven interactive and immersive narrative experience. The project offers\\nnew insights into AI technology, artistic practice, and psychoanalysis.\\nInspired by actual geographical landscapes and familial archetypes, the work\\ncombines psychoanalytic theory and computational technology, providing an\\nartistic response to the concept of the non-existence of the Big Other. The\\nnarrative is driven by a combination of a large language model (LLM) and a\\nrealistic digital character, forming a virtual agent named YELL. Through\\ndialogue and exploration within a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE),\\nthe audience is invited to unravel the language puzzles presented by YELL and\\nhelp him overcome his life challenges. YELL is a fictional embodiment of the\\nBig Other, modeled after the artist's real father. Through a cross-temporal\\ninteraction with this digital father, the project seeks to deconstruct complex\\nfamilial relationships. By demonstrating the non-existence of the Big Other, we\\naim to underscore the authenticity of interpersonal emotions, positioning art\\nas a bridge for emotional connection and understanding within family dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:54:11Z\"}"}
