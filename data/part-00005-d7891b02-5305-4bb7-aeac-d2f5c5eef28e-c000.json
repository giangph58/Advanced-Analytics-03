{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06599v1\", \"title\": \"Axionless Solution to the Strong CP Problem -- two-zeros textures of the\\n  quark and lepton mass matrices and neutrino CP violation --\", \"summary\": \"CP invariance is a very attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD.\\nThis solution requires the vanishing ${\\\\rm arg}\\\\,[{\\\\rm det}\\\\, M_d\\\\, {\\\\rm det}\\nM_u]$, where the $M_d$ and $M_u$ are the mass matrices for the down- and\\nup-type quarks. It happens if we have several zeros in the quark mass matrices.\\nWe proceed a systematic construction, in this paper, of two zeros textures for\\nthe down-type quark mass matrix while the mass matrix for the up-type quarks is\\nalways diagonal. We find only three types of the mass matrices can explain the\\nobserved CKM matrix, the masses of the quarks and the charged leptons and the\\nsmall enough vacuum angle $\\\\theta < 10^{-10}$. We extend the mass construction\\nto the neutrino sector and derive predictions on the CP violating parameter\\n$\\\\delta_{CP}$ in the neutrino oscillation and the mass parameter\\n$m_{\\\\beta\\\\beta}$. It is extremely remarkable that the normal (NH) and inverted\\n(IH) hierarchies in the neutrino masses are equally possible in the case where\\nwe introduce only two right-handed neutrinos $N$s. Furthermore, we have a\\nstrict prediction on the $\\\\delta_{CP} \\\\simeq 200^\\\\circ$ or $250^\\\\circ$ in the\\nNH case. If it is the case we can naturally explain the positive sign of the\\nbaryon asymmetry in the present universe.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:52:11Z\"}"}
