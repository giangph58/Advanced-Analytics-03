However, recent\\nefforts have primarily focused on elementary computations, implemented in\\nsystems based on pre-defined reservoirs, or in periodic systems such as arrays\\nof buckling beams. Here, we numerically demonstrate a passive mechanical system\\n-- in the form of a nonlinear mass-spring model -- that tackles a real-world\\nbenchmark for keyword spotting in speech signals. The model is organized in a\\nhierarchical architecture combining feature extraction and continuous-time\\nconvolution, with each individual stage tailored to the physics of the\\nconsidered mass-spring systems. For each step in the computation, a subsystem\\nis designed by combining a small set of low-order polynomial potentials. These\\npotentials act as fundamental components that interconnect a network of masses.\\nIn analogy to electronic circuit design, where complex functional circuits are\\nconstructed by combining basic components into hierarchical designs, we refer\\nto this framework as springtronics. We introduce springtronic systems with\\nhundreds of degrees of freedom, achieving speech classification accuracy\\ncomparable to existing sub-mW electronic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cond-mat.dis-nn,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:31:19Z\"}"}
