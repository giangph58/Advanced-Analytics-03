{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01578v1\", \"title\": \"Entanglement in the symmetric subspace: mapping multipartite to\\n  bipartite states\", \"summary\": \"We propose a technique to investigate multipartite entanglement in the\\nsymmetric subspace. Our approach is to map an $N$-qubit symmetric state onto a\\nbipartite symmetric state of higher local dimension. We show that this mapping\\npreserves separability and allows to characterize the entanglement of the\\noriginal multipartite state. In particular, we provide several bounds to\\nestimate the symmetric tensor rank and geometric measure of entanglement.\\nAdditionally, we identify multipartite symmetric states whose entanglement\\noutperforms that of previously known candidates for maximally entangled\\nsymmetric states. Finally, we reveal the existence of entangled symmetric\\nsubspaces, where all bipartite states are entangled.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:31:18Z\"}"}
