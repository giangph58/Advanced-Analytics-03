For certain double-well potentials with\\nquadratic interaction, the criterion holds up to the critical temperature of\\nthe model, and we also obtain precise asymptotics on the decay of the\\nlog-Sobolev constant when approaching the critical point. The criterion also\\napplies to ``diluted'' mean-field models defined on sufficiently dense,\\npossibly random graphs. We further generalize the criterion to non-quadratic\\ninteractions that admit a mode decomposition. The mode decomposition is\\ndifferent from the scale decomposition of the Polchinski flow we used for\\nshort-range spin systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math-ph,math.FA,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:53:00Z\"}"}
