The natural\\n(infinite-dimensional) fluid algebra on co-exact 1-forms on a three-dimensional\\nclosed oriented Riemannian manifold leads to an Euler equation which is\\nequivalent to the classical Euler equation which describes non-viscous fluid\\nflow. In this paper, the recently introduced transverse intersection algebra\\nassociated to a cubic lattice of An-Lawrence-Sullivan is used to construct a\\nfinite-dimensional fluid algebra on a cubic lattice (with odd periods). The\\ncorresponding Euler equation is an ODE which it is proposed is a `good'\\ndiscretisation of the continuum Euler equation. This paper contains all the\\nexplicit details necessary to implement numerically the corresponding Euler\\nequation. Such an implementation has been carried out by our team and results\\nare pending.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math.AT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:46:03Z\"}"}
