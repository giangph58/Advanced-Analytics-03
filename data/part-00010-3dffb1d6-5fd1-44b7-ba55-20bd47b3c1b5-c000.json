Modeling efforts have shown that energy and plasma\\nexchanges near the transition region plays a crucial role in modulating solar\\nwind properties. Although these regions cannot be measured in situ, plasma\\nparameters can be inferred from coronal spectroscopy and ionization states of\\nheavy ions, which remain unchanged as they escape the corona. We introduce a\\nnew solar wind model extending from the chromosphere to the inner heliosphere,\\ncapturing thermodynamic coupling across atmospheric layers. By including\\nneutral and charged particle interactions, we model the transport and\\nionisation processes of the gas through the transition region, the corona and\\ninto the solar wind. Instead of explicitly modeling coronal heating, we link\\nits spatial distribution to large-scale magnetic field properties. Our results\\nconfirm that energy deposition strongly affects wind properties through key\\nmechanisms involving chromospheric evaporation, thermal expansion, and magnetic\\nflux expansion. For sources near active regions, the model predicts significant\\nsolar wind acceleration, with plasma outflows comparable to those inferred from\\ncoronal spectroscopy. For winds from large coronal holes, the model reproduces\\nthe observed anticorrelation between charge state and wind speed. However, the\\npredicted charge state ratios are overall lower than observed. Inclusion of a\\npopulation of energetic electrons enhances both heavy ion charge states and\\nsolar wind acceleration, improving agreement with observations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:23:53Z\"}"}
