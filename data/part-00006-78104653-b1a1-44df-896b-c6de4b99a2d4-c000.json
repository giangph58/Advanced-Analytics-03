This $\\\\sim$ 5$\\\\sigma$ discrepancy between early\\nand late measurements of the Hubble Constant arises from observations that rely\\non cosmological distance estimates, either explicitly or implicitly. In this\\nstudy, we relax the assumption of the Friedmann-Lema\\\\^itre-Robertson-Walker\\n(FLRW) distance-redshift relation and explore the influence of small-scale\\ninhomogeneities on the propagation of light from distant sources, using the\\nZeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder (ZKDR) approximation as an alternative approach\\nto address this tension. We employ the ZKDR equation along with a modified\\nversion to test our hypothesis using recent Type Ia supernovae data from the\\nPantheon+ compilation and the SH0ES collaboration and six gravitational lens\\nsystems from the H0LiCOW collaboration. Our findings indicate that a background\\nmodel characterized by the ZKDR approximation and its modifications does not\\nsolve or alleviate the Hubble tension.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:45:50Z\"}"}
