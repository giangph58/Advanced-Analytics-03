While allowing cyclic derivations does not\\nchange the system, the non-well-founded and well-founded derivations we\\nconsider define the same proper infinitary extension of $\\\\mathsf{GLP}$. We\\nestablish that this extension is strongly algebraic and neighbourhood complete\\nwith respect to both local and global semantic consequence relations. In fact,\\nthese completeness results are proved for generalizations of global and local\\nconsequence relations, which we call global-local. In addition, we prove strong\\nlocal neighbourhood completeness for the original system $\\\\mathsf{GLP}$ (with\\nordinary derivations only).\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:00:05Z\"}"}
