There are results in the literature determining the structure of\\nfinite groups whose irreducible character degrees, conjugacy class sizes or\\nindices of maximal subgroups are odd. These results have been extended to\\ninclude those finite groups whose character degrees or conjugacy class sizes\\nare not divisible by $4$. In this paper, we determine the structure of finite\\ngroups whose maximal subgroups have index not divisible by $4$. As a\\nconsequence, we obtain some new $2$-nilpotency criteria.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:06:42Z\"}"}
