{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01605v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Relation Graph-Kernel Strengthen Network for Graph-Level\\n  Clustering\", \"summary\": \"Graph-level clustering is a fundamental task of data mining, aiming at\\ndividing unlabeled graphs into distinct groups. However, existing deep methods\\nthat are limited by pooling have difficulty extracting diverse and complex\\ngraph structure features, while traditional graph kernel methods rely on\\nexhaustive substructure search, unable to adaptive handle multi-relational\\ndata. This limitation hampers producing robust and representative graph-level\\nembeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Relation\\nGraph-Kernel Strengthen Network for Graph-Level Clustering (MGSN), which\\nintegrates multi-relation modeling with graph kernel techniques to fully\\nleverage their respective advantages. Specifically, MGSN constructs\\nmulti-relation graphs to capture diverse semantic relationships between nodes\\nand graphs, which employ graph kernel methods to extract graph similarity\\nfeatures, enriching the representation space. Moreover, a relation-aware\\nrepresentation refinement strategy is designed, which adaptively aligns\\nmulti-relation information across views while enhancing graph-level features\\nthrough a progressive fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple\\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MGSN over state-of-the-art\\nmethods. The results highlight its ability to leverage multi-relation\\nstructures and graph kernel features, establishing a new paradigm for robust\\ngraph-level clustering.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:17:15Z\"}"}
