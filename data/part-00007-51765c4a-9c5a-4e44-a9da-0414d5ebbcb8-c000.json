Byzantine clients can prevent others\\nfrom collecting identical sets of gradient estimates. The aggregation step thus\\nneeds to be combined with an efficient (approximate) agreement subroutine to\\nensure convergence of the training process.\\n  In this work, we study the geometric median aggregation rule for Byzantine\\ncollaborative learning. We show that known approaches do not provide\\ntheoretical guarantees on convergence or gradient quality in the agreement\\nsubroutine. To satisfy these theoretical guarantees, we present a hyperbox\\nalgorithm for geometric median aggregation.\\n  We practically evaluate our algorithm in both centralized and decentralized\\nsettings under Byzantine attacks on non-i.i.d. data. We show that our geometric\\nmedian-based approaches can tolerate sign-flip attacks better than known\\nmean-based approaches from the literature.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:55:24Z\"}"}
