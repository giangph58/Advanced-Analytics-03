Simulations of PBH\\nformation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to\\nblack hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our\\nUniverse. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach\\nfor these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a\\nnon-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp\\napproach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution\\nequations suffer from divergent terms (0/0), which complicate and prevent the\\nsimulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple\\nmanner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable,\\nallowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism.\\nUsing a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new\\napproach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time\\nevolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and\\nPBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not\\nnecessarily result in PBH formation.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:53:38Z\"}"}
