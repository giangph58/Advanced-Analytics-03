On the one hand, we focus on understanding the evolution of the free\\nboundary near isolated singular points, and we establish for the first time\\nupper and (more surprisingly) lower estimates for its evolution. In 2D, these\\nbounds almost match the best known ones for radial solutions, but hold for all\\nsolutions to the Stefan problem, with no extra assumption on the initial or\\nboundary data. On the other hand, as a consequence of our results, we also\\ncharacterize the global regularity of the free boundary, as follows: it can be\\nwritten as a graph $t = \\\\Gamma(x)$, where $\\\\Gamma$ is $C^1$ (and not $C^2$)\\nnear any singular points in the lower strata $\\\\Sigma_m$, $m \\\\leq n - 2$.\\nMoreover, $\\\\Gamma$ is not $C^1$ at singular points in $\\\\Sigma_{n-1}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:26:54Z\"}"}
