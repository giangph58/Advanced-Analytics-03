{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02677v1\", \"title\": \"Monte Carlo evaluations of gamma-ray and radio pulsar populations\", \"summary\": \"Based on well-grounded Galactic neutron star populations formed from radio\\npulsar population syntheses of canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars\\n(MSPs), we use the latest Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4) to investigate the\\nimplications of proposed $\\\\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Using Monte Carlo\\ntechniques, we calculate the number of CPs and MSPs that would comprise the\\nsample of pulsar-like unidentified sources (PLUIDs) in 4FGL-DR4. While radio\\nbeaming fractions were used to scale the sizes of the populations, when forming\\nthe mock 4FGL-DR4 samples, we make the simplifying assumption that all\\n$\\\\gamma-$ray pulsars are beaming towards the Earth. We then explore the\\nobservable outcomes of seven different $\\\\gamma-$ray luminosity models. Four of\\nthe models provide a good match to the observed number of PLUIDs, while three\\nothers significantly over-predict the number of PLUIDs. For these latter\\nmodels, either the average beaming fraction of $\\\\gamma-$ray pulsars is more\\nlike 25--50\\\\%, or a revision in the luminosity scaling is required. Most of the\\nradio detectable MSPs that our models predict as part of the PLUIDs within\\n4FGL-DR4 are, unsurprisingly, fainter than the currently observed sample and at\\nlarger dispersion measures. For CPs, in spite of an excellent match to the\\nobserved radio population, none of the $\\\\gamma-$ray models we investigated\\ncould replicate the observed sample of 150 $\\\\gamma-$ray CPs. Further work is\\nrequired to understand this discrepancy. For both MSPs and CPs, we provide\\nencouraging forecasts for targeted radio searches of PLUIDs from 4FGL-DR4 to\\nelucidate the issues raised in this study.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:37Z\"}"}
