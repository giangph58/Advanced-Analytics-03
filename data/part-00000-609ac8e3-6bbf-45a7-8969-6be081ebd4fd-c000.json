{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06741v1\", \"title\": \"Large Scale Supervised Pretraining For Traumatic Brain Injury\\n  Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"The segmentation of lesions in Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury\\n(msTBI) presents a significant challenge in neuroimaging due to the diverse\\ncharacteristics of these lesions, which vary in size, shape, and distribution\\nacross brain regions and tissue types. This heterogeneity complicates\\ntraditional image processing techniques, resulting in critical errors in tasks\\nsuch as image registration and brain parcellation. To address these challenges,\\nthe AIMS-TBI Segmentation Challenge 2024 aims to advance innovative\\nsegmentation algorithms specifically designed for T1-weighted MRI data, the\\nmost widely utilized imaging modality in clinical practice. Our proposed\\nsolution leverages a large-scale multi-dataset supervised pretraining approach\\ninspired by the MultiTalent method. We train a Resenc L network on a\\ncomprehensive collection of datasets covering various anatomical and\\npathological structures, which equips the model with a robust understanding of\\nbrain anatomy and pathology. Following this, the model is fine-tuned on\\nmsTBI-specific data to optimize its performance for the unique characteristics\\nof T1-weighted MRI scans and outperforms the baseline without pretraining up to\\n2 Dice points.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:52:45Z\"}"}
