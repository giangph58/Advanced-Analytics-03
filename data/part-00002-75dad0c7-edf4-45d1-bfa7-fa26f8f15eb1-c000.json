As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes\\nare instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background\\ngeometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble\\nD3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero\\nform as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super\\nYang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining\\nYang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the\\nconfined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on\\n$S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic\\noperator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation\\nfunction of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic\\nspectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined\\ncorrelation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our\\nmodel is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective\\ninteraction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the\\ncoupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation\\nfrom the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic\\ncorrelation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on\\nD7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves\\nfrom the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the\\nhard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction\\nwith spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic\\nfermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:51:40Z\"}"}
