Given access to\\n$M$ independent voter model trajectories evolving up to time $T$, we establish\\nthat $G^*$ can be recovered \\\\emph{exactly} with probability at least $0.9$ by\\nan \\\\emph{efficient} algorithm, provided that \\\\[ M \\\\cdot \\\\min\\\\{T, n\\\\} \\\\geq C n^2\\np^2 \\\\log n \\\\] holds for a sufficiently large constant $C$. Here, $M\\\\cdot\\n\\\\min\\\\{T,n\\\\}$ can be interpreted as the approximate number of effective update\\nrounds being observed, since the voter model on $G^*$ typically reaches\\nconsensus after $\\\\Theta(n)$ rounds, and no further information can be gained\\nafter this point. Furthermore, we prove an \\\\emph{information-theoretic} lower\\nbound showing that the above condition is tight up to a constant factor. Our\\nresults indicate that the recovery problem does not exhibit a\\nstatistical-computational gap.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:47:52Z\"}"}
