{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05749v1\", \"title\": \"Limitations of the $g$-tensor formalism of semiconductor spin qubits\", \"summary\": \"The $g$-tensor formalism is a powerful method for describing the electrical\\ndriving of semiconductor spin qubits. However, up to now, this technique has\\nonly been applied to the simplest qubit dynamics, resonant monochromatic\\ndriving by a single gate. Here we study the description of (i) monochromatic\\ndriving using two driving gates and bichromatic driving via (ii) one or (iii)\\ntwo gates. Assuming a general Hamiltonian with qubit states well separated from\\nexcited orbital states, we find that when (i) two driving gates are used for\\nmonochromatic driving or (ii) a single one for bichromatic, the $g$-tensor\\nformalism successfully captures the leading-order dynamics. We express the Rabi\\nfrequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift using the $g$-tensor and its first and\\nsecond derivatives with respect to the gate voltage. However, when (iii)\\nbichromatic driving is realized using two distinct driving gates, we see a\\nbreakdown of $g$-tensor formalism: the Rabi frequency cannot be expressed using\\nthe $g$-tensor and its derivatives. We find that beyond the $g$-tensor and its\\nderivatives, three additional parameters are needed to capture the dynamics. We\\ndemonstrate our general results by assuming an electron (hole) confined in a\\ncircular quantum dot, subjected to Rashba spin-orbit interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:25:13Z\"}"}
