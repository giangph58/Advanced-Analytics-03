In the all-order\\nconsistent BMHV scheme anticommutativity has to be sacrificed, resulting in\\nspurious breakings of BRST invariance, the restoration of which necessitates\\nfinite, symmetry-restoring counterterms. Following recent advances in\\nsuccessfully applying this scheme to multi-loop calculations for Abelian\\nmodels, we shall here present the first complete non-Abelian two-loop result\\nfor the case of $SU(2)$, which is of particular interest to the Standard Model.\\nWe provide the complete list of finite, two-loop symmetry restoring\\ncounterterms and discuss intricacies of the non-Abelian implementation. Except\\nfor one novel term, the finite counterterm action exhibits the same structure\\nas at one-loop order.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:20:22Z\"}"}
