{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02591v1\", \"title\": \"State-Space Model Inspired Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Spiking\\n  Neurons\", \"summary\": \"In spiking neural networks (SNNs), the main unit of information processing is\\nthe neuron with an internal state. The internal state generates an output spike\\nbased on its component associated with the membrane potential. This spike is\\nthen communicated to other neurons in the network. Here, we propose a general\\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spiking neuron model that goes beyond\\nthis traditional single-input single-output (SISO) model in the SNN literature.\\nOur proposed framework is based on interpreting the neurons as state-space\\nmodels (SSMs) with linear state evolutions and non-linear spiking activation\\nfunctions. We illustrate the trade-offs among various parameters of the\\nproposed SSM-inspired neuron model, such as the number of hidden neuron states,\\nthe number of input and output channels, including single-input multiple-output\\n(SIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) models. We show that for SNNs\\nwith a small number of neurons with large internal state spaces, significant\\nperformance gains may be obtained by increasing the number of output channels\\nof a neuron. In particular, a network with spiking neurons with multiple-output\\nchannels may achieve the same level of accuracy with the baseline with the\\ncontinuous-valued communications on the same reference network architecture.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:55:11Z\"}"}
