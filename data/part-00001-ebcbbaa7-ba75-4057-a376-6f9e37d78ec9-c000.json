The existing trajectory planners that account\\nfor the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime.\\nTo achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance\\n(CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel\\ncoarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In\\nthe first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct\\ntopological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second\\nstage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these\\ntopologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently\\npartitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for\\nback-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates\\ntrajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a\\ncontinuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the\\nproposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the\\ncutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate\\nand ensuring CCA.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:34:34Z\"}"}
