{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06187v1\", \"title\": \"Scaling Invariance: A Gateway to Phase Transitions\", \"summary\": \"We explore the concept of scaling invariance in a type of dynamical systems\\nthat undergo a transition from order (regularity) to disorder (chaos). The\\nsystems are described by a two-dimensional, nonlinear mapping that preserves\\nthe area in the phase space. The key variables are the action and the angle, as\\nusual from Hamiltonian systems. The transition is influenced by a control\\nparameter giving the form of the order parameter. We observe a scaling\\ninvariance in the average squared action within the chaotic region, providing\\nevidence that this change from regularity (integrability) to chaos\\n(non-integrability) is akin to a second-order or continuous phase transition.\\nAs the order parameter approaches zero, its response against the variation of\\nthe control parameter (susceptibility) becomes increasingly pronounced (indeed\\ndiverging), resembling a phase transition. These findings could not be obtained\\nwithout a seminal paper on Phys. Rev.
