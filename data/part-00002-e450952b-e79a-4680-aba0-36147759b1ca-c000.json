{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06570v1\", \"title\": \"Data quality or data quantity? Prioritizing data collection under\\n  distribution shift with the data usefulness coefficient\", \"summary\": \"Researchers often have access to multiple data sources of varying quality.\\nFor example, in psychology, a researcher may decide between running an\\nexperiment on an online platform or on a representative sample of the\\npopulation of interest. Collecting a representative sample will result in\\nhigher quality data but is often more expensive. This raises the question of\\nhow to optimally prioritize data collection under resource constraints. We\\nstudy this question in a setting where the distribution shift arises through\\nmany independent random changes in the population. We introduce a \\\"data\\nusefulness coefficient\\\" (DUC) and show that it allows us to predict how much\\nthe risk of empirical risk minimization would decrease if a specific data set\\nwere added to the training data. An advantage of our procedure is that it does\\nnot require access to any outcome data $Y$. Instead, we rely on a random shift\\nassumption, which implies that the strength of covariate ($X$) shift is\\npredictive of the shift in $Y \\\\mid X$. We also derive methods for sampling\\nunder budget and size constraints. We demonstrate the benefits of data\\ncollection based on DUC and our optimal sampling strategy in several numerical\\nexperiments.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:11:22Z\"}"}
