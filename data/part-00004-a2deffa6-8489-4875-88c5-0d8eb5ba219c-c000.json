This analysis is\\ncarried out for an early universe, encompassing three separate cosmological\\nscenarios defined by power-law, exponential, and modified exponential scale\\nfactors. By deriving the modified field equations from the EPN action, we\\nobtain precise solutions for each scale factor, including the influence of the\\nvector field. We compute the baryon-to-entropy ratio using the gravitational\\nbaryogenesis formalism, where the baryon asymmetry arises from a dynamical\\ncoupling of the baryon current with the derivative of the Ricci scalar. Our\\nfindings demonstrate that the baryon-to-entropy ratio is consistent with\\nobservational constraints in all scenarios, highlighting the potential of EPN\\ngravity as a viable theory to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the\\nearly universe. The study further stresses the contribution of anisotropy and\\nvector field dynamics to the cosmological evolution within modified gravity\\nmodels.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:26:58Z\"}"}
