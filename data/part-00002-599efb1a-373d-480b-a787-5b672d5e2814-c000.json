We show that, in a\\nsuitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and\\nspatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the\\nbulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states\\npropagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The\\nexact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire\\ncouplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio\\nbetween the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our\\nmodel can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional\\nregime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and\\nfeatures hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge\\n$e$ for a positive odd integer $p$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:46:19Z\"}"}
