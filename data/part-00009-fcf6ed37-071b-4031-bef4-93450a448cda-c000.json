We calculate all the possible time reversal photon TMDs using\\nlight-front wave functions. For this work, we have considered photon as a\\nFock-state of quark anti-quark pair. All the $9$ T-even TMDs have been\\npresented in the overlap and explicit form of light-front wave functions using\\nthe helicity amplitudes. We observe that only $3$ TMDs are non-zero for the\\ncase of a real photon as compared to $8$ for virtual photon. We briefly discuss\\nthe unpolarized $f_1 (x,\\\\textbf{k}_\\\\perp)$, longitudinally polarized\\n$g_{1L}(x,\\\\textbf{k}^2_\\\\perp)$, transversly polarized\\n$h_1(x,\\\\textbf{k}^2_\\\\perp)$ and tensor polarized\\n$f_{1LL}(x,\\\\textbf{k}^2_\\\\perp)$ TMDs for both real and virtual photon.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:10:46Z\"}"}
