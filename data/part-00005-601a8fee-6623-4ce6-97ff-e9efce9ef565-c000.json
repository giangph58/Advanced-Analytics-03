{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06178v1\", \"title\": \"Flash Sculptor: Modular 3D Worlds from Objects\", \"summary\": \"Existing text-to-3D and image-to-3D models often struggle with complex scenes\\ninvolving multiple objects and intricate interactions. Although some recent\\nattempts have explored such compositional scenarios, they still require an\\nextensive process of optimizing the entire layout, which is highly cumbersome\\nif not infeasible at all. To overcome these challenges, we propose Flash\\nSculptor in this paper, a simple yet effective framework for compositional 3D\\nscene/object reconstruction from a single image. At the heart of Flash Sculptor\\nlies a divide-and-conquer strategy, which decouples compositional scene\\nreconstruction into a sequence of sub-tasks, including handling the appearance,\\nrotation, scale, and translation of each individual instance. Specifically, for\\nrotation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine scheme that brings the best of both\\nworlds--efficiency and accuracy--while for translation, we develop an\\noutlier-removal-based algorithm that ensures robust and precise parameters in a\\nsingle step, without any iterative optimization. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that Flash Sculptor achieves at least a 3 times speedup over\\nexisting compositional 3D methods, while setting new benchmarks in\\ncompositional 3D reconstruction performance.
