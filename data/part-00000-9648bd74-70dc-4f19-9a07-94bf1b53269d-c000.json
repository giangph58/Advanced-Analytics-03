{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24105v1\", \"title\": \"Data-Driven Distributed Output Synchronization of Heterogeneous\\n  Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we assume that an autonomous exosystem generates a reference\\noutput, and we consider the problem of designing a distributed data-driven\\ncontrol law for a family of discrete-time heterogeneous LTI agents, connected\\nthrough a directed graph, in order to synchronize the agents' outputs to the\\nreference one. The agents of the network are split into two categories:\\nleaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only\\nreceive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output\\nsynchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states\\nas well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an\\ninternal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders\\nand followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a\\nsolution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven\\ncontext. An example illustrates both the implementation procedure and the\\nperformance of the proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:57:18Z\"}"}
