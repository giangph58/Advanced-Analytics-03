{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02800v1\", \"title\": \"A Survey of Large Language Models in Mental Health Disorder Detection on\\n  Social Media\", \"summary\": \"The detection and intervention of mental health issues represent a critical\\nglobal research focus, and social media data has been recognized as an\\nimportant resource for mental health research. However, how to utilize Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for mental health problem detection on social media\\nposes significant challenges. Hence, this paper aims to explore the potential\\nof LLM applications in social media data analysis, focusing not only on the\\nmost common psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety but also\\nincorporating psychotic disorders and externalizing disorders, summarizing the\\napplication methods of LLM from different dimensions, such as text data\\nanalysis and detection of mental disorders, and revealing the major challenges\\nand shortcomings of current research. In addition, the paper provides an\\noverview of popular datasets, and evaluation metrics. The survey in this paper\\nprovides a comprehensive frame of reference for researchers in the field of\\nmental health, while demonstrating the great potential of LLMs in mental health\\ndetection to facilitate the further application of LLMs in future mental health\\ninterventions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:43:14Z\"}"}
