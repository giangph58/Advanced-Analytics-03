{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07542v1\", \"title\": \"SydneyScapes: Image Segmentation for Australian Environments\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are being partially deployed and tested across\\nvarious global locations, including China, the USA, Germany, France, Japan,\\nKorea, and the UK, but with limited demonstrations in Australia. The\\nintegration of machine learning (ML) into AV perception systems highlights the\\nneed for locally labelled datasets to develop and test algorithms in specific\\nenvironments. To address this, we introduce SydneyScapes - a dataset tailored\\nfor computer vision tasks of image semantic, instance, and panoptic\\nsegmentation. This dataset, collected from Sydney and surrounding cities in New\\nSouth Wales (NSW), Australia, consists of 756 images with high-quality\\npixel-level annotations. It is designed to assist AV industry and researchers\\nby providing annotated data and tools for algorithm development, testing, and\\ndeployment in the Australian context. Additionally, we offer benchmarking\\nresults using state-of-the-art algorithms to establish reference points for\\nfuture research and development.
