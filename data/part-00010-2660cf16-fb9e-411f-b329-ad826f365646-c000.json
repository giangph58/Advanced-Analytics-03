{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04817v1\", \"title\": \"Robustness of topological phases on aperiodic lattices\", \"summary\": \"We study the robustness of topological phases on aperiodic lattices by\\nconstructing *-homomorphisms from the groupoid model to the coarse-geometric\\nmodel of observable C*-algebras. These *-homomorphisms induce maps in K-theory\\nand Kasparov theory. We show that the strong topological phases in the groupoid\\nmodel are detected by position spectral triples. We show that topological\\nphases coming from stacking along another Delone set are always weak in the\\ncoarse-geometric sense.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math-ph,math.KT,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:16:01Z\"}"}
