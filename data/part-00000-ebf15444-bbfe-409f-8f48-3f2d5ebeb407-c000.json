Such decision-making\\nproblems can be naturally formulated as optimization problems where these\\nconditional activations are regulated by discrete variables. However, solving\\nthese problems can be challenging numerically, even on powerful computing\\nplatforms, especially when the dynamics are nonlinear. In this work, we\\nconsider decision-making for nonlinear systems where certain constraints, as\\nwell as possible terms in the cost function, are activated or deactivated\\ndepending on the system state and commands. We show that these problems can be\\nformulated either as mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) or as\\nmathematical programs with vanishing constraints (MPVCs), where the former\\nformulation involves discrete decision variables, whereas the latter relies on\\ncontinuous variables subject to structured nonconvex constraints. We discuss\\nthe different solution methods available for both formulations and demonstrate\\nthem on optimal trajectory planning problems in various aerospace applications.\\nFinally, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the MINLP and MPVC\\napproaches through a focused case study on powered descent guidance with\\ndivert-feasible regions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:08:52Z\"}"}
