For group-like symmetries, distinct SPT\\nphases share identical bulk excitations and always differ by SPT orders.\\nHowever, for certain non-invertible symmetries, we discover novel SPT phases\\nthat have different bulk excitations and thus do not differ by SPT orders.\\nAdditionally, we also study the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of\\nnon-invertible symmetries. Unlike group-like symmetries, non-invertible\\nsymmetries lack the concept of subgroups, which complicates the definition of\\nSSB phases as well as their identification. This challenge can be addressed by\\nemploying the symmetry-topological-order (symTO) framework for the symmetry.\\nThe Lagrangian condensable algebras and automorphisms of the symTO facilitate\\nthe classification of gapped phases in systems with such symmetries, enabling\\nthe analysis of both SPT and SSB phases (including those that differ by SPT\\norders). Finally, we apply this methodology to investigate gapless phases in\\nsymmetric systems and to study gapless phases differing by SPT orders.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:58:33Z\"}"}
