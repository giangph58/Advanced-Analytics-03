{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659v1\", \"title\": \"Integrability of Combinatorial Riemann Boundary Value Problem and\\n  Lattice Walk Avoiding a Quadrant\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a general framework of matrix-form combinatorial Riemann\\nboundary value problem (cRBVP) to characterize the integrability of functional\\nequations arising in lattice walk enumeration. A matrix cRBVP is defined as\\nintegrable if it can be reduced to enough polynomial equations with one\\ncatalytic variable. Our central results establish that the integrability\\ndepends on the eigenspace of some matrix associated to the problem. For lattice\\nwalks in three quadrants, we demonstrate how the obstinate kernel method\\ntransforms discrete difference equations into $3 \\\\times 3$ matrix cRBVPs. The\\nspecial doubleroots eigenvalue 1/4 yields two independent polynomial equations\\nin the problem. The other single-root eigenvalue yields a linear equation.\\nCrucially, our framework generalizes three-quadrant walks with Weyl symmetry to\\nmodels satisfying only orbit-sum conditions. It explains many criteria about\\nthe orbit-sum proposed by various researchers and also works for walks starting\\noutside the quadrant.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:15:36Z\"}"}
