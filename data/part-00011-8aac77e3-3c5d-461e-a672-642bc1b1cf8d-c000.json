{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07605v1\", \"title\": \"Strong Decays of Charmonia\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we calculate the charmonium spectrum and strong decay widths of\\ncc states. The calculations are performed using the quark potential model with\\nwhich incorporates the relativistic effects. The resulting cc spectrum exhibits\\na good agreement with experimental data. The open flavor strong decay widths\\nare calculated employing the 3P0 model. We adopt two choices of wave functions\\nto determine the observables: the first involves the utilization of realistic\\nwave functions obtained by solving relativistic Schrodinger equation, while the\\nsecond employs Simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) wave functions whose parameters\\nare fitted to the realistic wave functions. We find that the decay widths of\\nhigher charmonia states above the threshold value of open charm mesons are well\\ndescribed with these wave functions. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the\\nstrong decay widths and assigned specific charmonium states: X(3940) is\\nassigned to the {\\\\eta}c(3S) state, Y (4660) to the {\\\\psi}(5S) state, X(3915) to\\nthe \\\\c{hi}0(2P) state, Zc(3900) to the hc(2P) state, X(4350) to the \\\\c{hi}2(3P)\\nstate, and X(3842) to the {\\\\psi}3(1D) state. We also compare our results with\\navailable experimental data and theoretical predictions of other models.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:56:23Z\"}"}
