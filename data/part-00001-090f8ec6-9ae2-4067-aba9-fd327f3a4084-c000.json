{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerated Airfoil Design Using Neural Network Approaches\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure\\ndistribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using\\nboth Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\\ntechniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations\\ncarried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and\\nangles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset\\ncaptured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are\\ndeveloped depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that\\nthe refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a\\nmulti-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex\\ndatasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil\\nshapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the\\neffectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN\\nmodels is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing\\naircraft model of wingspan >10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure\\ndistribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show\\npromising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning\\nmodels accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of\\nhigh-performance airfoils.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math-ph,math.MP,physics.app-ph,physics.flu-dyn,physics.space-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:14:14Z\"}"}
