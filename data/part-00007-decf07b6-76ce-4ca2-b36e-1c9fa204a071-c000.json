They share lots of common properties with Voevodsky's\\nframed correspondences and lead to symmetric matrix motives of algebraic\\nvarieties introduced in this paper. Symmetric matrix motives recover\\n$K$-motives and fit in a closed symmetric monoidal triangulated category of\\nsymmetric matrix motives constructed in this paper by using methods of enriched\\nmotivic homotopy theory.\", \"main_category\": \"math.KT\", \"categories\": \"math.KT,math.AG,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:49:33Z\"}"}
