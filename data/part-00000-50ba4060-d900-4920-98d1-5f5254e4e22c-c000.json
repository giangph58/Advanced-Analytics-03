Its rigorous derivation typically relies\\non sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace\\ntransforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the\\nLandau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach\\nvia functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this\\ntransition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions\\nestablish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent\\nis then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This\\nderivation is rigorous and mathematically simple. Our work provides new insight\\ninto the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition\\nprobability.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:40:25Z\"}"}
