Moreover, we introduce a new cohomology that controls the deformations\\nof restricted morphisms of restricted Lie algebras. In the case $p=2$, we\\nprovide a full restricted cohomology complex with values in a restricted module\\nand investigate its connections with formal deformations. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce a full deformation cohomology that controls deformations of\\nrestricted morphisms of restricted Lie algebras in characteristic $2$. As\\nexample, we discuss restricted cohomology with adjoint coefficients of\\nrestricted Heisenberg Lie algebras in characteristic $p\\\\geq 2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:36:31Z\"}"}
