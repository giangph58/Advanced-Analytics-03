Out of the various analytical techniques available to\\ncharacterize them, infrared transflectance using a tuneable mid-IR quantum\\ncascade laser is a high-throughput state-of-the-art imaging option,\\nspecifically Agilent QCL-LDIR (Quantum Cascade Laser Direct Infrared imaging).\\nIts conceptual grounds are reviewed, instrumental developments are discussed,\\nalong with a review of applications and best practices to overcome\\nobstacles/difficulties in routine measurements, namely: the spectral range, the\\nvariation of some peak intensities with the particles size, effects of the size\\nof the particles, processing speed, and avoiding the use of measurement\\naliquots. Objective procedures to avoid too many false positives when\\nidentifying spectra and to distinguish fibers and fragments are given. These\\npractices open a path to QCL-LDIR measurement standardization and potential use\\nfor microplastics monitoring, as requested by many governmental bodies in\\ncharge of setting environmental protection rules.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:04:13Z\"}"}
