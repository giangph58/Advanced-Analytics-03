This work analyzes the applicability of serverless\\nservices for running the STAR aligner, which is known for its accuracy and\\nlarge memory requirement. This presents a challenge, as serverless services\\nwere designed for light and short tasks. Nevertheless, we successfully deploy a\\nSTAR-based pipeline on AWS ECS service, propose multiple optimizations, and\\nperform experiment with 17 TBs of data. Results are compared against standard\\nvirtual machine (VM) based solution showing that serverless is a valid\\nalternative for small-scale batch processing. However, in large-scale where\\nefficiency matters the most, VMs are still recommended.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:45:46Z\"}"}
