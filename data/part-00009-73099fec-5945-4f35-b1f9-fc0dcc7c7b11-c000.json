Using reduced-order simulations of a\\nlarge ensemble of randomly perturbed films, we show that the answer is not\\ndetermined by just the film's volume. While very thin films always stay open\\nand very thick films always plug, we find a range of intermediate films for\\nwhich plugging is uncertain. The fastest-growing linear mode of the\\nRayleigh-Plateau instability ensures that the film's volume is divided among\\nmultiple humps. However, the nonlinear growth of these humps can occur\\nunevenly, due to spontaneous axial sliding -- a lucky hump can sweep up a\\ndisproportionate share of the film's volume and so form a plug. This\\nsliding-induced plugging is robust and prevails with or without gravitational\\nand ciliary transport.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:04:44Z\"}"}
