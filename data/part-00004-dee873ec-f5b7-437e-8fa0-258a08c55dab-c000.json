{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05226v1\", \"title\": \"Proposing TAGbank as a Corpus of Tree-Adjoining Grammar Derivations\", \"summary\": \"The development of lexicalized grammars, particularly Tree-Adjoining Grammar\\n(TAG), has significantly advanced our understanding of syntax and semantics in\\nnatural language processing (NLP). While existing syntactic resources like the\\nPenn Treebank and Universal Dependencies offer extensive annotations for\\nphrase-structure and dependency parsing, there is a lack of large-scale corpora\\ngrounded in lexicalized grammar formalisms. To address this gap, we introduce\\nTAGbank, a corpus of TAG derivations automatically extracted from existing\\nsyntactic treebanks. This paper outlines a methodology for mapping\\nphrase-structure annotations to TAG derivations, leveraging the generative\\npower of TAG to support parsing, grammar induction, and semantic analysis. Our\\napproach builds on the work of CCGbank, extending it to incorporate the unique\\nstructural properties of TAG, including its transparent derivation trees and\\nits ability to capture long-distance dependencies. We also discuss the\\nchallenges involved in the extraction process, including ensuring consistency\\nacross treebank schemes and dealing with language-specific syntactic\\nidiosyncrasies. Finally, we propose the future extension of TAGbank to include\\nmultilingual corpora, focusing on the Penn Korean and Penn Chinese Treebanks,\\nto explore the cross-linguistic application of TAG's formalism. By providing a\\nrobust, derivation-based resource, TAGbank aims to support a wide range of\\ncomputational tasks and contribute to the theoretical understanding of TAG's\\ngenerative capacity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:13:19Z\"}"}
