For a hypergraph $(X,\\\\mathcal{H})$, a\\nsupport $Q$ is a graph on $X$ s.t. $Q[H]$, the graph induced on vertices in $H$\\nis connected for every $H\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}$.\\n  We consider \\\\emph{primal}, \\\\emph{dual}, and \\\\emph{intersection} hypergraphs\\ndefined by subgraphs of a graph $G$ that are \\\\emph{non-piercing}, (i.e., each\\nsubgraph is connected, their pairwise differences remain connected).\\n  If $G$ is outerplanar, we show that the primal, dual and intersection\\nhypergraphs admit supports that are outerplanar. For a bounded treewidth graph\\n$G$, we show that if the subgraphs are non-piercing, then there exist supports\\nfor the primal and dual hypergraphs of treewidth $O(2^{tw(G)})$ and\\n$O(2^{4tw(G)})$ respectively, and a support of treewidth $2^{O(2^{tw(G)})}$ for\\nthe intersection hypergraph. We also show that for the primal and dual\\nhypergraphs, the exponential blow-up of treewidth is sometimes essential.\\n  All our results are algorithmic and yield polynomial-time algorithms (when\\nthe treewidth is bounded). The existence and construction of sparse supports is\\na crucial step in the design and analysis of PTASs and/or sub-exponential time\\nalgorithms for several packing and covering problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:04:30Z\"}"}
