{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01824v1\", \"title\": \"Topological Feature of Real-time Fisher Zeros\", \"summary\": \"There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero\\nmodes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much\\nattention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and\\nthermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes\\ncan be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This\\neffect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain\\nmodel, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological\\nzero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the\\nsystem and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy\\neigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the\\none-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain.\\nWe present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions\\neliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural\\nstatistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between\\ntopology and many-body physics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-lat,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:30:24Z\"}"}
