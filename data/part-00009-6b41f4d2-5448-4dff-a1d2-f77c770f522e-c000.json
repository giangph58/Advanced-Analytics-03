This solution\\nreveals that the magnitude of magnetization is always directly proportional to\\nthe particle number density. Furthermore, the problem can be interpreted as a\\nparticle's motion in a central force field. It is demonstrated that the\\nparticle's orbits are elliptical in shape, with a precession angle determined\\nby a non-zero mass current. This suggests that the spatial periods of the three\\ncomponent magnetizations are not commensurate. These findings indicate that the\\ncoupling of mass superflow and magnetization distortions usually results in an\\nincommensurate magnetization.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:47:05Z\"}"}
