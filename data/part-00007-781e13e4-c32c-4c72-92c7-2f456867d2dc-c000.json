{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05241v1\", \"title\": \"Chiral magnetic excitations and domain textures of $g$-wave altermagnets\", \"summary\": \"Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in\\nwhich opposite-spin sublattices are connected by a crystal rotation, causing\\ntheir electronic iso-energy surfaces to be spin-split. While cubic and\\ntetragonal crystal symmetries tend to produce AMs in which the splitting of\\nelectronic iso-energy surfaces has $d$-wave symmetry, hexagonal AMs, such as\\nCrSb and MnTe, are $g$-wave AMs. Here we investigate the purely magnetic modes\\nand spin-textures of $g$-wave AMs and show that they are drastically different\\nfor easy-axial (CrSb) and easy-planar (MnTe) materials. We show that in CrSb\\nthe splitting of the chiral magnon branches possesses $g$-wave symmetry, with\\neach branch carrying a fixed momentum-independent magnetic moment. The\\naltermagnetic splitting is not affected by the easy-axial anisotropy and is the\\nsame as that in the nonrelativistic limit. The magnon splitting of MnTe,\\nhowever, does not strictly possess $g$-wave symmetry due to its easy-planar\\nanisotropy. Instead the magnetic moment of each branch becomes\\nmomentum-dependent, with a distribution that is of $g$-wave symmetry. To\\ngeneralize the concept of the altermagnetic splitting beyond the\\nnonrelativistic limit, we introduce alternative, directly observable splitting\\nparameter which comprises both the magnon eigenenergy and its magnetic moment\\nand possesses the $g$-wave symmetry in both easy-axial and easy-planar cases.\\nThe associated altermagnetic domain walls in easy-axial CrSb possess a net\\nmagnetization with an amplitude that depends on their orientation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:25:54Z\"}"}
