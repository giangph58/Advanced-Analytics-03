While\\nexisting works focus on optimizing denoising directions, we address the\\nprincipled design of stepsize schedules. This paper proposes Optimal Stepsize\\nDistillation, a dynamic programming framework that extracts theoretically\\noptimal schedules by distilling knowledge from reference trajectories. By\\nreformulating stepsize optimization as recursive error minimization, our method\\nguarantees global discretization bounds through optimal substructure\\nexploitation. Crucially, the distilled schedules demonstrate strong robustness\\nacross architectures, ODE solvers, and noise schedules. Experiments show 10x\\naccelerated text-to-image generation while preserving 99.4% performance on\\nGenEval.
