The proposed model is a two-dimensional\\nIsing-lattice gas model that employs Kawasaki dynamics to mimic the\\ninteractions between oil, water, and air, as well as external forces such as\\ngravity and acoustic stress. By incorporating both acoustic streaming and\\nacoustic radiation pressure, the model captures key experimental observations,\\nincluding selective oil extraction and droplet motion under SAW excitation. The\\nresults highlight the critical role of acoustic radiation pressure in enabling\\noil film formation and detachment, governed by the balance between capillary\\nand acoustic stresses. The study provides qualitative agreement with\\nexperimental findings and offers insights into the essential mechanisms driving\\nacoustowetting-induced phase separation, demonstrating the utility of discrete\\nmodeling for complex fluid dynamics problems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:59:18Z\"}"}
