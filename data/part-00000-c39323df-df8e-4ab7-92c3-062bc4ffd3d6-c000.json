The straight ahead approach is hard to implement when the number of\\ncharacters become large. We combine all characters of an RCFT to form a vector\\nvalued modular form with multiplier. Using known results from the theory of\\nvector valued modular forms, given a known RCFT, we obtain new vector valued\\nmodular forms that share the same multiplier as the original RCFT. By taking\\nparticular linear combinations of the new solutions, we look for and find new\\nadmissible solutions. In the well-studied two character case, we reproduce all\\nknown admissible solutions with Wronskian indices $6$ and $8$. The method is\\nillustrated with examples with up to six characters. The method using vector\\nvalued modular forms thus provides a new approach to the holomorphic modular\\nbootstrap.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:26:56Z\"}"}
