We\\nreview the technologies used to revitalize these languages, finding that when\\nthey come from outside, they often have the opposite effect to what they seek;\\nhowever, when developed from within communities, they become powerful\\ninstruments of expression. We propose that the inclusion of Indigenous\\nknowledge in large language models (LLMs) will enrich the technological\\nlandscape, but must be done in a participatory environment that encourages the\\nexchange of knowledge.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:08:53Z\"}"}
