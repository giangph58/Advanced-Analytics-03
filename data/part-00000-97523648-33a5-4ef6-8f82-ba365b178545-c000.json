{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24141v1\", \"title\": \"The Influence of an Adjoint Mismatch on the Primal-Dual Douglas-Rachford\\n  Method\", \"summary\": \"The primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method is a well-known algorithm to solve\\noptimization problems written as convex-concave saddle-point problems. Each\\niteration involves solving a linear system involving a linear operator and its\\nadjoint. However, in practical applications it is often computationally\\nfavorable to replace the adjoint operator by a computationally more efficient\\napproximation. This leads to an adjoint mismatch. In this paper, we analyze the\\nconvergence of the primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method under the presence of an\\nadjoint mismatch. We provide mild conditions that guarantee the existence of a\\nfixed point and find an upper bound on the error of the primal solution.\\nFurthermore, we establish step sizes in the strongly convex setting that\\nguarantee linear convergence under mild conditions. Additionally, we provide an\\nalternative method that can also be derived from the Douglas-Rachford method\\nand is also guaranteed to converge in this setting. Moreover, we illustrate our\\nresults both for an academic and a real-world inspired example.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:25:59Z\"}"}
