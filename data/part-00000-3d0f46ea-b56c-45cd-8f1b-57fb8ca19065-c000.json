Recently, data-driven methods such as sparse regression have been\\nemployed to automatically uncover governing equations from data, representing a\\nsignificant shift from traditional first-principles modeling. However, most\\nexisting methods focus on scalar equations, limiting their applicability to\\nsimple, low-dimensional scenarios, and failing to ensure rotation and\\nreflection invariance without incurring significant computational cost or\\nrequiring additional prior knowledge. This paper proposes a Cartesian\\ntensor-based sparse regression (CTSR) technique to accurately and efficiently\\nuncover complex, high-dimensional governing equations while ensuring\\ninvariance. Evaluations on two two-dimensional (2D) and two three-dimensional\\n(3D) test cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy\\nand efficiency compared to the conventional technique.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:06:29Z\"}"}
