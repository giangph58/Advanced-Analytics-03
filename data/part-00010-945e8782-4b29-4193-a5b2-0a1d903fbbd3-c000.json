{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06015v1\", \"title\": \"Robust Statistics vs. Machine Learning vs. Bayesian Inference: Insights\\n  into Handling Faulty GNSS Measurements in Field Robotics\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents research findings on handling faulty measurements (i.e.,\\noutliers) of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for robot localization\\nunder adverse signal conditions in field applications, where raw GNSS data are\\nfrequently corrupted due to environmental interference such as multipath,\\nsignal blockage, or non-line-of-sight conditions. In this context, we\\ninvestigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange\\nobservations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for\\nfaulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution\\napproximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the\\ntheoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies\\nwithin a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging\\nsensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data\\ncollected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both\\nestablished techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the\\nunderstanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for\\nrobust, long-term robot localization. In addition to presenting successful\\nresults, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to\\nmotivate future research in robust state estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:21:04Z\"}"}
