Conventional techniques typically impose a trade-off\\nbetween pulse energy and frequency tunability. Here, we introduce a novel\\nfree-electron laser approach that overcomes these limitations by pre-modulating\\na relativistic electron beam with a frequency-beating laser pulse and\\nleveraging bunch compression along with collective effects to enhance\\nmicrobunching. Experimental results demonstrate that this technique generates\\nnarrowband THz emission with continuous frequency tunability from 7.8 to\\n30.8THz, achieving pulse energies up to 385{\\\\mu}J while maintaining spectral\\nbandwidths between 7.7% and 14.7%. Moreover, the method exhibits exceptional\\nrobustness and scalability, highlighting its unique ability to bridge the\\nlong-standing THz gap and offering a promising solution for diverse\\ncutting-edge scientific applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:11:59Z\"}"}
