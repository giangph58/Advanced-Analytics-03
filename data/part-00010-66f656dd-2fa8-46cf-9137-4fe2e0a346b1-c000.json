{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06591v1\", \"title\": \"NAPER: Fault Protection for Real-Time Resource-Constrained Deep Neural\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Fault tolerance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed on\\nresource-constrained systems presents unique challenges for high-accuracy\\napplications with strict timing requirements. Memory bit-flips can severely\\ndegrade DNN accuracy, while traditional protection approaches like Triple\\nModular Redundancy (TMR) often sacrifice accuracy to maintain reliability,\\ncreating a three-way dilemma between reliability, accuracy, and timeliness. We\\nintroduce NAPER, a novel protection approach that addresses this challenge\\nthrough ensemble learning. Unlike conventional redundancy methods, NAPER\\nemploys heterogeneous model redundancy, where diverse models collectively\\nachieve higher accuracy than any individual model. This is complemented by an\\nefficient fault detection mechanism and a real-time scheduler that prioritizes\\nmeeting deadlines by intelligently scheduling recovery operations without\\ninterrupting inference. Our evaluations demonstrate NAPER's superiority: 40%\\nfaster inference in both normal and fault conditions, maintained accuracy 4.2%\\nhigher than TMR-based strategies, and guaranteed uninterrupted operation even\\nduring fault recovery. NAPER effectively balances the competing demands of\\naccuracy, reliability, and timeliness in real-time DNN applications\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:37:54Z\"}"}
