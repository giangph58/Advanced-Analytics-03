A total of 71 transitions were measured and assigned between\\n6.8--10.6\\\\,GHz. Using these assignments, we searched for emission from\\ncyanocoronene in the GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting Aromatic Molecules\\n(GOTHAM) project observations of the cold dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the\\n100\\\\,m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We detect a number of individually resolved\\ntransitions in ultrasensitive X-band observations and perform a Markov Chain\\nMonte Carlo analysis to derive best-fit parameters, including a total column\\ndensity of $N(\\\\mathrm{C}_{24}\\\\mathrm{H}_{11}\\\\mathrm{CN}) = 2.69^{+0.26}_{-0.23}\\n\\\\times 10^{12}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ at a temperature of\\n$6.05^{+0.38}_{-0.37}\\\\,$K. A spectral stacking and matched filtering analysis\\nprovides a robust 17.3$\\\\,\\\\sigma$ significance to the overall detection. The\\nderived column density is comparable to that of cyano-substituted naphthalene,\\nacenaphthylene, and pyrene, defying the trend of decreasing abundance with\\nincreasing molecular size and complexity found for carbon chains. We discuss\\nthe implications of the detection for our understanding of interstellar PAH\\nchemistry and highlight major open questions and next steps.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:15:54Z\"}"}
