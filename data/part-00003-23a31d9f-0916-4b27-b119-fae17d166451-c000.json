{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02467v1\", \"title\": \"BOOST: Bootstrapping Strategy-Driven Reasoning Programs for\\n  Program-Guided Fact-Checking\", \"summary\": \"Program-guided reasoning has shown promise in complex claim fact-checking by\\ndecomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs.\\nHowever, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with\\nad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design\\nwith substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of\\neffective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it\\nchallenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose\\nBOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program\\ngeneration. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and\\ninformation-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation,\\niteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and\\ndata-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless\\ntransition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning,\\nenhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that\\nBOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot\\nsettings for complex claim verification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:38:45Z\"}"}
