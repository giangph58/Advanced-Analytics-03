Charged hadron yields\\nare extracted by counting cluster pairs in the inner and outer layers of the\\nIntermediate Silicon Tracker, with corrections applied for detector acceptance,\\nreconstruction efficiency, combinatorial pairs, and contributions from\\nsecondary decays. The measured distributions cover $|\\\\eta| < 1.1$ across\\nvarious centralities, and the average pseudorapidity density of charged hadrons\\nat mid-rapidity is compared to predictions from Monte Carlo heavy-ion event\\ngenerators. This result, featuring full azimuthal coverage at mid-rapidity, is\\nconsistent with previous experimental measurements at the Relativistic Heavy\\nIon Collider, thereby supporting the broader sPHENIX physics program.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:13:21Z\"}"}
