Using anisotropic interpolation operators the estimator is\\nelementwise separated with respect to the single directions in space and time\\nleading to adaptive, anisotropic mesh refinement in a natural way. To prevent\\nspurious oscillations the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is\\napplied to stabilize the underlying system in the case of high P\\\\'{e}clet\\nnumbers. Efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithm are demonstrated\\nfor different goal functionals. The directional error indicators quantify\\nanisotropy of the solution with respect to the goal, and produce meshes that\\nefficiently capture sharp layers. Numerical examples show the superiority of\\nthe proposed approach over isotropic adaptive and global mesh refinement using\\nestablished benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:34:56Z\"}"}
