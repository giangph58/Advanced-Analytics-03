{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06092v1\", \"title\": \"Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering\", \"summary\": \"Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy\\nnuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity\\ncalculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we\\ndevelop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on\\n(Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body\\nscattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral\\npotential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix\\nNumerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for\\nsolving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of\\ncoupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is\\napplied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing\\ntraining samples (\\\"snapshots\\\") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper\\northogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for\\ncomputationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy\\napproach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the\\ngroundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon\\nand three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational\\nspeed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators\\nand error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,nucl-ex,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:34:51Z\"}"}
