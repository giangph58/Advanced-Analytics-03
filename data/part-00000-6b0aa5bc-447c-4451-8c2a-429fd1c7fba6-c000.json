{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06816v1\", \"title\": \"A Graph Diffusion Algorithm for Lexical Similarity Evaluation\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present an algorithm for evaluating lexical similarity\\nbetween a given language and several reference language clusters. As an input,\\nwe have a list of concepts and the corresponding translations in all considered\\nlanguages. Moreover, each reference language is assigned to one of $c$ language\\nclusters. For each of the concepts, the algorithm computes the distance between\\neach pair of translations. Based on these distances, it constructs a weighted\\ndirected graph, where every vertex represents a language. After, it solves a\\ngraph diffusion equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition, where the unknown\\nis a map from the vertex set to $\\\\mathbb{R}^c$. The resulting coordinates are\\nvalues from the interval $[0,1]$ and they can be interpreted as probabilities\\nof belonging to each of the clusters or as a lexical similarity distribution\\nwith respect to the reference clusters. The distances between translations are\\ncalculated using phonetic transcriptions and a modification of the\\nDamerau-Levenshtein distance. The algorithm can be useful in analyzing\\nrelationships between languages spoken in multilingual territories with a lot\\nof mutual influences. We demonstrate this by presenting a case study regarding\\nvarious European languages.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:17:08Z\"}"}
