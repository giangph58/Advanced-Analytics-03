The effects of radiation, which are expected\\nto lead to quantum decoherence and a reduction of entanglement, are generally\\nneglected in such measurements. In this letter we calculate the effects of\\ndecoherence from various different types of radiation for a maximally entangled\\npair of fermions -- a bipartite system of qubits in a Bell state. We identify\\nthe Kraus operators describing the evolution of the open quantum system with\\nthe integrated Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:44:25Z\"}"}
