It is\\nshown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity,\\npassivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the\\nspatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and\\nonly if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone.\\nThis implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined\\nuniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in\\nthe LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which\\nthe state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of\\nfading memory functional.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:16:47Z\"}"}
