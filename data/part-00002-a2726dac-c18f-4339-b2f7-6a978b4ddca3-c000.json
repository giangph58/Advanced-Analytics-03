{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06875v1\", \"title\": \"Surface Oxidation of SnTe Analyzed by Self-Consistent Fitting of all\\n  Emission Peaks in its X-ray Photoelectron Spectrum\", \"summary\": \"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is among the most widely used methods\\nfor surface characterization. Currently, the analysis of XPS data is almost\\nexclusively based on the main emission peak of a given element and the rest of\\nthe spectrum is discarded. This makes quantitative chemical state analyses by\\npeak fitting prone to substantial error, especially in light of incomplete and\\nflawed reference literature. However, most elements give rise to multiple\\nemission peaks in the x-ray energy range, which are virtually never analyzed.\\nFor samples with an inhomogeneous depth distribution of chemical states, these\\npeaks show different but interdependent ratios of signal components, as they\\ncorrespond to different information depths. In this work, we show that\\nself-consistent fitting of all emission peaks lends additional reliability to\\nthe depth profiling of chemical states by angular-resolved (AR-)XPS. We\\ndemonstrate this using a natively oxidized thin film of the topological\\ncrystalline insulator tin telluride (SnTe). This approach is not only\\ncomplementary to existing depth profiling methods, but may also pave the way\\ntowards complete deconvolution of the XPS spectrum, facilitating a more\\ncomprehensive and holistic understanding of the surface chemistry of solids.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:26:36Z\"}"}
