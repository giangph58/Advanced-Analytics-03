{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04959v1\", \"title\": \"An all optical broadband tunable quantum frequency shifter\", \"summary\": \"A frequency shifter of the photon is a key component for\\nfrequency-multiplexed high-capacity quantum communications and\\nfrequency-encoded quantum computation. Existed methods for shifting the\\nfrequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect,\\nhowever, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz,\\nfurthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of\\na photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the\\nfrequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is\\nusually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between\\nthese methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter\\nbased on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a\\nfrequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap. As a\\nprinciple of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading\\nprocess, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and\\nthe shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency\\ndifference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence\\nratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the\\npreserve of quantum properties. The present quantum frequency shifter is in\\nanalog to an electro-optical based shifter, but with much broader tuning\\nability. Our all-optical quantum frequency shifter will become a fundamental\\nbuilding block for high-speed quantum communication networks and frequency\\ndomain photonic quantum computation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:47:57Z\"}"}
