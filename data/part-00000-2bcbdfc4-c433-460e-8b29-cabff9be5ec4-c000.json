Our\\nframework integrates the Doob $h$-transformation with the Montroll defect\\ntheory, overcoming the strict constraints associated with each method alone. By\\ncombining these two approaches, we map random walks in simple potentials onto\\nprocesses involving more general external potentials and metastable states.\\nExplicit analytical expressions relate the transformed process to the original\\none, facilitating direct investigation of exponential decay rates and\\nadditional dynamical modes. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate our\\nmethod by analyzing a random walker in a linear potential modified to include a\\nmetastable state, revealing distinct exponential decay regimes relevant to\\nescape dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:47:14Z\"}"}
