In this work, we show that a strong drive even at frequency lower than\\nthe double superconducting gap enables dissipation in the junctions due to\\nphoton-assisted breaking of the Cooper pairs. Both the decay rate and noise\\nstrength associated with the losses are sensitive to the dc phase bias of the\\njunction and can be tuned in a broad range by the amplitude and the frequency\\nof the external driving field, making the suggested mechanism potentially\\nattractive for designing tunable dissipative elements. Furthermore, pronounced\\nmemory effects in the driven Josephson junctions render them perspective for\\nboth theoretical and experimental study of non-Markovian physics in\\nsuperconducting quantum circuits. We illustrate our theoretical findings by\\nstudying the spectral properties and the steady state population of a low\\nimpedance resonator coupled to the driven Josephson junction.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:31:18Z\"}"}
