{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24368v1\", \"title\": \"Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Real-time Ultrasound Image\\n  Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel approach that adapts hierarchical vision foundation models\\nfor real-time ultrasound image segmentation. Existing ultrasound segmentation\\nmethods often struggle with adaptability to new tasks, relying on costly manual\\nannotations, while real-time approaches generally fail to match\\nstate-of-the-art performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an\\nadaptive framework that leverages the vision foundation model Hiera to extract\\nmulti-scale features, interleaved with DINOv2 representations to enhance visual\\nexpressiveness. These enriched features are then decoded to produce precise and\\nrobust segmentation. We conduct extensive evaluations on six public datasets\\nand one in-house dataset, covering both cardiac and thyroid ultrasound\\nsegmentation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\\nmethods across multiple datasets and excels with limited supervision,\\nsurpassing nnUNet by over 20\\\\% on average in the 1\\\\% and 10\\\\% data settings.\\nOur method achieves $\\\\sim$77 FPS inference speed with TensorRT on a single GPU,\\nenabling real-time clinical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:47:42Z\"}"}
