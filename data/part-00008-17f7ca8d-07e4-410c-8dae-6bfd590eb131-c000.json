{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01790v1\", \"title\": \"SOLAQUA: SINTEF Ocean Large Aquaculture Robotics Dataset\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a dataset gathered with an underwater robot in a\\nsea-based aquaculture setting. Data was gathered from an operational fish farm\\nand includes data from sensors such as the Waterlinked A50 DVL, the Nortek\\nNucleus 1000 DVL, Sonardyne Micro Ranger 2 USBL, Sonoptix Mulitbeam Sonar, mono\\nand stereo cameras, and vehicle sensor data such as power usage, IMU, pressure,\\ntemperature, and more. Data acquisition is performed during both manual and\\nautonomous traversal of the net pen structure. The collected vision data is of\\nundamaged nets with some fish and marine growth presence, and it is expected\\nthat both the research community and the aquaculture industry will benefit\\ngreatly from the utilization of the proposed SOLAQUA dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:58:16Z\"}"}
