{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06912v1\", \"title\": \"A modified-residue prescription to calculate dynamical correlation\\n  functions\", \"summary\": \"One of the challenges in using numerical methods to address many-body\\nproblems is the multi-dimensional integration over poles. More often that not,\\none needs such integrations to be evaluated as a function of an external\\nvariable. An example would be calculating dynamical correlations functions that\\nare used to model response functions, where the external variable is the\\nfrequency. The standard numerical techniques rely on building an adaptive mesh,\\nusing special points in the Brillouin zone or using advanced smearing\\ntechniques. Most of these techniques, however, suffer when the grid is coarse.\\nHere we propose that, if one knows the nature of the singularity in the\\nintegrand, one can define a residue and use it to faithfully estimate the\\nintegral and reproduce all the resulting singular features even with a coarse\\ngrid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for different scenarios of\\ncalculating correlation functions with different resulting singular features,\\nfor calculating collective modes and densities of states. We also present a\\nquantitative analysis of the error and show that this method can be widely\\napplicable.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:20:46Z\"}"}
