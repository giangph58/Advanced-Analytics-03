We introduce CoRAG, a\\nframework extending RAG to collaborative settings, where clients jointly train\\na shared model using a collaborative passage store. To evaluate CoRAG, we\\nintroduce CRAB, a benchmark for collaborative homogeneous open-domain question\\nanswering. Our experiments demonstrate that CoRAG consistently outperforms both\\nparametric collaborative learning methods and locally trained RAG models in\\nlow-resource scenarios. Further analysis reveals the critical importance of\\nrelevant passages within the shared store, the surprising benefits of\\nincorporating irrelevant passages, and the potential for hard negatives to\\nnegatively impact performance. This introduces a novel consideration in\\ncollaborative RAG: the trade-off between leveraging a collectively enriched\\nknowledge base and the potential risk of incorporating detrimental passages\\nfrom other clients. Our findings underscore the viability of CoRAG, while also\\nhighlighting key design challenges and promising avenues for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.IR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:40:43Z\"}"}
