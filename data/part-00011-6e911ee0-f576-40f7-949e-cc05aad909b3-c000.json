{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06253v1\", \"title\": \"Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut\", \"summary\": \"The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm\\nthat finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,\\nespecially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\\nOptimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various\\nways of \\\"warm-starting\\\" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using\\nclassically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically\\ncause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.\\nFor the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state\\nusing the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of\\nthe corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite\\nwarmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard\\nreduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We\\nempirically compare this approach to a \\\"QUBO-relaxation\\\" approach that relaxes\\nthe QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging\\nfrom randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such\\nas the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio\\noptimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly\\ndependent on the problem type.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.DM,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:57:12Z\"}"}
