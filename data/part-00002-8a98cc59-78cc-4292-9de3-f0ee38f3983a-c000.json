We solve the following question in the negative: if the\\ninitial measure is ergodic and has full support, do all weak-* limit points of\\nthe sequence of measures have full support as well? The initial measure of our\\nsolution is not a product measure, and in this case the question remains open.\\nTo this end, we present a tool for studying the frequencies of symbols in\\npreimages of surjective cellular automata, and prove some basic results about\\nit. % do we know they are nontrivial? :P However, we show that by itself it is\\nnot enough to solve the stricter question in the positive.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:01:13Z\"}"}
