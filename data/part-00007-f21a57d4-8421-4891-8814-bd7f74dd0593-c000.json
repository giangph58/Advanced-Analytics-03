{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06798v1\", \"title\": \"Probing Remote Nuclear Magnetic Moments in hBN with VB Electron Spin\", \"summary\": \"Since the initial discovery of optically addressable spins of the negatively\\ncharged boron vacancy defect (VB) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), substantial\\nprogress has been made, enabling promising applications in quantum sensing,\\ninformation processing, and simulations. A deep understanding of the VB\\n(electron): hBN (nuclear) spin systems is crucial for realizing these\\npotentials. In this article, we employ Electron Nuclear Double Resonance\\n(ENDOR) to demonstrate the sensing of dis tant nuclear spins via the VB\\nelectron spin. We identify the nature and localization of the probed nuclear\\nmagnetic moments as 14N spins localized 0.4 nm away from the vacancy and\\nresolve the energies of the corresponding interactions. Density Functional\\nTheory (DFT) calculations further confirm these findings, providing a detailed\\ndescription of the interactions between the VB electron spin and surrounding\\nnitrogen atoms in different shells. The results establish the VB electron spin\\nas a promising tool for developing novel van der Waals material-based nuclear\\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) probes, advancing the understanding of spin physics in\\nhBN, and unlocking its potential to study distant nuclear spin interactions in\\nthe host.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:44:53Z\"}"}
