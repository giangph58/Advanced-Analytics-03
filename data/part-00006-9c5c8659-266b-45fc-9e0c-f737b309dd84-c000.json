Over time, individuals opting\\nto relocate led to vast metropolises like London and Paris during the\\nIndustrial Revolution, Shanghai and Karachi during the last decades and\\nthousands of smaller settlements. Here, we analyze the impact that migration\\nhas on population redistribution. We use a model of city-to-city migration as a\\nprocess that occurs within a network, where the nodes represent cities, and the\\nedges correspond to the flux of individuals. We analyze metrics characterizing\\nthe urban distribution and show how a slight preference for some destinations\\nmight result in the observed distribution of the population.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:45:14Z\"}"}
