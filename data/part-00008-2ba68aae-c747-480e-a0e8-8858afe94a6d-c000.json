Our comprehensive framework follows Bayesian\\nprinciples and consists of specialized Markov chain Monte Carlo computational\\nschemes that rely on modified Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to align with summary\\nstatistic constraints and a novel elliptical slice sampler adapted to the\\nparameters of biological models. We benchmark our methods with synthetic data\\non microbial growth in batch culture and test them on real growth curve data\\nfrom laboratory replication experiments on $\\\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ microbes.\\nThe results indicate that our learning framework can utilize experimental or\\nhistorical data and lead to robust parameter estimation and data assimilation\\nin ODE models of biological dynamics that outperform least-squares fitting.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.QM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:45:10Z\"}"}
