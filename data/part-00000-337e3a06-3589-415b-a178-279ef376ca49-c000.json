Specifically, given a $(d+1)$-uniform hypergraph $H$, we define\\nits hypergraphic zonotope $\\\\mathcal{Z}_H$, and when $H$ is the complete\\n$(d+1)$-uniform hypergraph $K^{(d+1)}_n$, we call its hypergraphic zonotope the\\nacyclohedron $\\\\mathcal{A}_{n,d}$.\\n  We express the volume of $\\\\mathcal{Z}_H$ as a homologically weighted count of\\nthe spanning $d$-dimensional hypertrees of $H$, which is closely related to\\nKalai's generalization of Cayley's theorem in the case when $H=K^{(d+1)}_n$\\n(but which, curiously, is not the same). We also relate the vertices of\\nhypergraphic zonotopes to a notion of acyclic orientations previously studied\\nby Linial and Morganstern for complete hypergraphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:42Z\"}"}
