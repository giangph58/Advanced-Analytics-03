Social robots seemingly have the potential to\\npositively shape group interactions, but it seems difficult to effect such\\nimpact by designing robot behaviors solely based on related (human interaction)\\nliterature. In this article, we take a user-centered approach to explore how\\nteenagers envisage a social robot \\\"group assistant\\\". We engaged 16 teenagers in\\nfocus groups, interviews, and robot testing to capture their views and\\nreflections about robots for groups. Over the course of a two-week summer\\nschool, participants co-designed the action space for such a robot and\\nexperienced working with/wizarding it for 10+ hours. This experience further\\naltered and deepened their insights into using robots as group assistants. We\\nreport results regarding teenagers' views on the applicability and use of a\\nrobot group assistant, how these expectations evolved throughout the study, and\\ntheir repeat interactions with the robot. Our results indicate that each group\\nmoves on a spectrum of need for the robot, reflected in use of the robot more\\n(or less) for ice-breaking, turn-taking, and fun-making as the situation\\ndemanded.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:19:24Z\"}"}
