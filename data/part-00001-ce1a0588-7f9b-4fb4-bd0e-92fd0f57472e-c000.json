Earlier studies\\nwithout trigonal warping have found discrete half-metal and quarter-metal\\nstates with full spin and/or valley polarization and complete depletion of some\\nof the Fermi surfaces. We show that when trigonal warping terms are included in\\nthe dispersion, partially polarized states with large but non-complete\\npolarization and with both majority and minority carriers present, emerge at\\nsmall doping, as seen in the experimental data. We show the results when the\\nintervalley and intravalley interactions are equal as well as when they are\\nunequal.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:42Z\"}"}
