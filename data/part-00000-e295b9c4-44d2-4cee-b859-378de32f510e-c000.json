{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23979v1\", \"title\": \"The more the merrier: logical and multistage processors in credit\\n  scoring\", \"summary\": \"Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts\\nsuch as organizational justice or healthcare, which has spawned a great demand\\nfor fairness in these procedures. In this paper we focus on the application of\\nfair ML in finance, more concretely on the use of fairness techniques on credit\\nscoring. This paper makes two contributions. On the one hand, it addresses the\\nexistent gap concerning the application of established methods in the\\nliterature to the case of multiple sensitive variables through the use of a new\\ntechnique called logical processors (LP). On the other hand, it also explores\\nthe novel method of multistage processors (MP) to investigate whether the\\ncombination of fairness methods can work synergistically to produce solutions\\nwith improved fairness or accuracy. Furthermore, we examine the intersection of\\nthese two lines of research by exploring the integration of fairness methods in\\nthe multivariate case. The results are very promising and suggest that logical\\nprocessors are an appropriate way of handling multiple sensitive variables.\\nFurthermore, multistage processors are capable of improving the performance of\\nexisting methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:44:17Z\"}"}
