Although these changes are generated by non-commuting\\noperators, we show that leveraging non-Gaussianity enables their simultaneous\\nestimation with arbitrarily high precision and arbitrarily low quantum\\nincompatibility. Specifically, we demonstrate that any pure non-Gaussian state\\nprovides an advantage over all Gaussian states, whether pure or mixed.\\nMoreover, properly tuned non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states can also\\nserve as a resource.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:11:32Z\"}"}
