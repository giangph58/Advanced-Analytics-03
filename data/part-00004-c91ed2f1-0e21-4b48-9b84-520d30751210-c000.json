In this paper, we adopt a related but\\ndifferent approach to examine those functions that allow us to define a\\n(quasi-)(pseudo)metric modular in the Cartesian product of\\n(quasi-)(pseudo)metric modular spaces. We base our research on the recent\\ndevelopment of a general theory of aggregation functions between quantales.\\nThis enables to shed light between the two different ways of aggregation\\n(quasi-)(pseudo)metric modulars.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:38:24Z\"}"}
