{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04971v1\", \"title\": \"Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized\\n  two-color fields II: Quantum interference\", \"summary\": \"We perform a systematic analysis of intra-channel quantum interference in\\nlaser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized\\nbichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent\\nionization (RESI) mechanism, and employing the strong-field approximation. We\\ngeneralize and elaborate several analytic interference conditions for RESI in\\narbitrary driving fields, with a focus on the interference arising from the\\nspecific symmetries of bichromatic fields. For example, for waves of comparable\\nstrengths, multiple events per half cycle for the direct electron must be\\nconsidered. Furthermore, interference breaks some of the symmetries arising\\nfrom the field. We detangle the superimposed interference fringes originating\\nfrom phase differences related to symmetrization due to electron exchange,\\ntemporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference. We show\\nthat the hierarchy between exchange-only and exchange-temporal interference is\\nfluid and can be manipulated by an appropriate choice of driving-field\\nparameters. This is enabled by different types of interference occupying\\nspecific regions of the plane spanned by the electron momentum components\\nparallel to the driving-field polarization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:57:18Z\"}"}
