{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04924v1\", \"title\": \"Inter-event Interval Microscopy for Event Cameras\", \"summary\": \"Event cameras, an innovative bio-inspired sensor, differ from traditional\\ncameras by sensing changes in intensity rather than directly perceiving\\nintensity and recording these variations as a continuous stream of \\\"events\\\".\\nThe intensity reconstruction from these sparse events has long been a\\nchallenging problem. Previous approaches mainly focused on transforming\\nmotion-induced events into videos or achieving intensity imaging for static\\nscenes by integrating modulation devices at the event camera acquisition end.\\nIn this paper, for the first time, we achieve event-to-intensity conversion\\nusing a static event camera for both static and dynamic scenes in fluorescence\\nmicroscopy. Unlike conventional methods that primarily rely on event\\nintegration, the proposed Inter-event Interval Microscopy (IEIM) quantifies the\\ntime interval between consecutive events at each pixel. With a fixed threshold\\nin the event camera, the time interval can precisely represent the intensity.\\nAt the hardware level, the proposed IEIM integrates a pulse light modulation\\ndevice within a microscope equipped with an event camera, termed Pulse\\nModulation-based Event-driven Fluorescence Microscopy.mAdditionally, we have\\ncollected IEIMat dataset under various scenes including high dynamic range and\\nhigh-speed scenarios. Experimental results on the IEIMat dataset demonstrate\\nthat the proposed IEIM achieves superior spatial and temporal resolution, as\\nwell as a higher dynamic range, with lower bandwidth compared to other methods.\\nThe code and the IEIMat dataset will be made publicly available.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:05:13Z\"}"}
