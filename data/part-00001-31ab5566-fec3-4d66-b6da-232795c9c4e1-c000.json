We study the case of $L^2$-subcritical\\nnonlinearities $g$ of Berestycki--Lions type, without assuming that $g$ is\\nsuperlinear at the origin, which allows us to include examples like a\\nlogarithmic term $g(u)= u\\\\log(u^2)$ or sublinear powers $g(u)=u^q-u^r$,\\n$0<r<1<q$. Due to the generality of $g$ and the fact that the energy functional\\nmight be not well-defined, we implement an approximation process in combination\\nwith a Lagrangian approach and a new Poho\\\\v{z}aev minimization in the product\\nspace, finding a solution for large values of $m$. In the sublinear case, we\\nare able to find a solution for each $m$. Several insights on the concepts of\\nminimality are studied as well. We highlight that some of the results are new\\neven in the local setting $s=1$ or for $g$ superlinear.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:35:02Z\"}"}
