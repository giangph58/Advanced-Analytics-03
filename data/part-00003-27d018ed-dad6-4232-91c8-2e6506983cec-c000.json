Modern LLMs are useful tools for ideation and exploration, but\\ncurrent chat-based user interfaces restrict users to a single linear flow. To\\naddress this limitation, we propose Narrative Studio -- a novel in-browser\\nnarrative exploration environment featuring a tree-like interface that allows\\nbranching exploration from user-defined points in a story. Each branch is\\nextended via iterative LLM inference guided by system and user-defined prompts.\\nAdditionally, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically expand\\npromising narrative paths based on user-specified criteria, enabling more\\ndiverse and robust story development. We also allow users to enhance narrative\\ncoherence by grounding the generated text in an entity graph that represents\\nthe actors and environment of the story.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:31:07Z\"}"}
