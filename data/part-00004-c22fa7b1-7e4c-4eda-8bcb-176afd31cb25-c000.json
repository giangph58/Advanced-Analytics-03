Identifying differences in the optical spectrum of various\\nobserved compact objects can help classify them as black holes or black hole\\nmimickers, such as traversable wormholes. Although multiple unstable critical\\ncurves have been reported to appear in asymmetric traversable wormholes, in\\nthis work we construct symmetric traversable wormholes with multiple unstable\\ncritical curves. We propose a general rational redshift function that allows us\\nto trace the number of critical points of the effective potential and determine\\ntheir nature as maxima or minima. The ray tracing method is used to study the\\ntrajectories of massless particles, particularly their behavior near the\\nunstable critical points. Finally, a thin accretion disk model is implemented\\nto analyze the optical appearance of the solution.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:11:10Z\"}"}
