Candidate foreign\\nsignals include lagged returns of stock markets and individual stocks across 47\\nforeign markets. By training over 100,000 models, we capture stock-specific,\\ntime-varying relationships between foreign signals and U.S. stock returns.\\nForeign signals exhibit out-of-sample return predictability for a subset of\\nU.S. stocks across domestic and multinational companies. Valuable foreign\\nsignals are not concentrated in those largest foreign markets nor foreign firms\\nin the same industry as U.S. firms. Signal importance analysis reveals the\\nprice discovery of foreign information is significantly slower for information\\nfrom emerging and low-media-coverage markets and among stocks with lower\\nforeign institutional ownership but is accelerated during the COVID-19 crisis.\\nOur study suggests that machine learning-based investment strategies leveraging\\nforeign signals can emerge as important mechanisms to improve the market\\nefficiency of foreign information.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.PR\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:31:35Z\"}"}
