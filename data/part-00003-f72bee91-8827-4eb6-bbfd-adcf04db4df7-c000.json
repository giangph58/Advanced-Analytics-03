{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02255v1\", \"title\": \"Bipedal Robust Walking on Uneven Footholds: Piecewise Slope LIPM with\\n  Discrete Model Predictive Control\", \"summary\": \"This study presents an enhanced theoretical formulation for bipedal\\nhierarchical control frameworks under uneven terrain conditions. Specifically,\\nowing to the inherent limitations of the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM)\\nin handling terrain elevation variations, we develop a Piecewise Slope LIPM\\n(PS-LIPM). This innovative model enables dynamic adjustment of the Center of\\nMass (CoM) height to align with topographical undulations during single-step\\ncycles. Another contribution is proposed a generalized Angular Momentum-based\\nLIPM (G-ALIP) for CoM velocity compensation using Centroidal Angular Momentum\\n(CAM) regulation. Building upon these advancements, we derive the DCM\\nstep-to-step dynamics for Model Predictive Control MPC formulation, enabling\\nsimultaneous optimization of step position and step duration. A hierarchical\\ncontrol framework integrating MPC with a Whole-Body Controller (WBC) is\\nimplemented for bipedal locomotion across uneven stepping stones. The results\\nvalidate the efficacy of the proposed hierarchical control framework and the\\ntheoretical formulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:54:10Z\"}"}
