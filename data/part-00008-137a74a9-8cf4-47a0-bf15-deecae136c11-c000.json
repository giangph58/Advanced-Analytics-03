{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05684v1\", \"title\": \"TARO: Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware\\n  Conditioning for Synchronized Video-to-Audio Synthesis\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with\\nOnset-Aware Conditioning (TARO), a novel framework for high-fidelity and\\ntemporally coherent video-to-audio synthesis. Built upon flow-based\\ntransformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for\\nenhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key\\ninnovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which\\ndynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based\\non the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2)\\nOnset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp\\nevent-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance\\nsynchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the\\nVGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior\\nmethods, achieving relatively 53\\\\% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower\\nFrechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its\\nsuperior audio quality and synchronization precision.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:49:36Z\"}"}
