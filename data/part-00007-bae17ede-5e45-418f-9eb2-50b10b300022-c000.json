These dichotomies give a complete characterization\\nof the complexity of \\\\#CSP on graph classes that forbid a complete graph as a\\nminor. In particular, we also demonstrate that, whether the maximum degree of\\nvertices is bounded may influence the complexity on specific minor-closed graph\\nclasses, and this phenomenon has never been observed in the previous related\\nstudies. Furthermore, our proofs integrate the properties of each graph class\\nwith the techniques from counting complexity, and develop a systematic approach\\nfor analyzing the complexity of \\\\#CSP on these graph classes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:59:44Z\"}"}
