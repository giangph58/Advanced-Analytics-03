{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24373v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerated Approximate Optimization of Multi-Commodity Flows on\\n  Directed Graphs\", \"summary\": \"We provide $m^{1+o(1)}k\\\\epsilon^{-1}$-time algorithms for computing\\nmultiplicative $(1 - \\\\epsilon)$-approximate solutions to multi-commodity flow\\nproblems with $k$-commodities on $m$-edge directed graphs, including concurrent\\nmulti-commodity flow and maximum multi-commodity flow.\\n  To obtain our results, we provide new optimization tools of potential\\nindependent interest. First, we provide an improved optimization method for\\nsolving $\\\\ell_{q, p}$-regression problems to high accuracy. This method makes\\n$\\\\tilde{O}_{q, p}(k)$ queries to a high accuracy convex minimization oracle for\\nan individual block, where $\\\\tilde{O}_{q, p}(\\\\cdot)$ hides factors depending\\nonly on $q$, $p$, or $\\\\mathrm{poly}(\\\\log m)$, improving upon the $\\\\tilde{O}_{q,\\np}(k^2)$ bound of [Chen-Ye, ICALP 2024]. As a result, we obtain the first\\nalmost-linear time algorithm that solves $\\\\ell_{q, p}$ flows on directed graphs\\nto high accuracy. Second, we present optimization tools to reduce approximately\\nsolving composite $\\\\ell_{1, \\\\infty}$-regression problems to solving\\n$m^{o(1)}\\\\epsilon^{-1}$ instances of composite $\\\\ell_{q, p}$-regression\\nproblem. The method builds upon recent advances in solving box-simplex games\\n[Jambulapati-Tian, NeurIPS 2023] and the area convex regularizer introduced in\\n[Sherman, STOC 2017] to obtain faster rates for constrained versions of the\\nproblem. Carefully combining these techniques yields our directed\\nmulti-commodity flow algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:53:00Z\"}"}
