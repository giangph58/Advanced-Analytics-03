However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the\\nchoice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, 2D materials\\npose a special challenge, as all 2D materials and their heterostructures have a\\ncrucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially\\ninhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in\\nalmost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description.\\nWe present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this\\nproblem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise\\nlinearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:31:46Z\"}"}
