Individual stars are now becoming routinely detected at\\ncosmological distances, where luminous stars such as supergiants in background\\ngalaxies critically lensed by galaxy clusters are temporarily further magnified\\nby huge factors up to $10^{4}$ by intra-cluster stars, thus being detected as\\ntransients. The detection rate of these events depends on the abundance of\\nluminous stars in the background galaxy and is thus sensitive to the IMF and\\nthe star formation history (SFH), especially for the blue supergiants detected\\nas transients in the rest-frame UV/optical filters. As a proof of concept, we\\nuse simple SFH and IMF models constrained by spectral energy distribution (SED)\\nto see how well we can predict the {\\\\it HST} and {\\\\it JWST} transient detection\\nrate in a lensed arc dubbed ``Spock'' ($z = 1.0054$). We find that demanding a\\nsimultaneously fit of SED and rest-frame UV/optical transient detection rate\\nplaces constraints on the IMF, independent of the assumed simple SFH model. We\\nconclude our Bayesian likelihood analysis indicates that the data definitively\\nprefer the ``Spock'' galaxy to have a Salpeter IMF ($\\\\alpha = 2.35$) rather\\nthan a Top-heavy IMF ($\\\\alpha = 1$) -- what is thought to be the case in the\\nearly universe -- given our methodology and assumptions with no clear excess of\\nsupergiants above the standard IMF.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:58:36Z\"}"}
