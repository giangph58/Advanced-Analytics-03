{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01686v1\", \"title\": \"Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals\", \"summary\": \"The article is dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the Landau Institute for\\nTheoretical Physics and is a review of normal and superconducting properties of\\ntoroidal, altermagnetic and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal\\norder are compounds with an electron spectrum that is asymmetric with respect\\nto the reflection of the momentum. An electric current propagating through\\nsamples of such a material causes its magnetization. Superconducting states in\\ntoroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet pair states.\\nSuperconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities.\\nAltermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific splitting of\\nelectron bands determined by symmetry. In this respect, they are similar to\\nmetals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of\\nthese types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating\\nthrough a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the\\ncase in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets there is a specific\\npiezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric\\nmetals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas in\\naltermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for\\nthe formation of a superconducting state.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:34:02Z\"}"}
