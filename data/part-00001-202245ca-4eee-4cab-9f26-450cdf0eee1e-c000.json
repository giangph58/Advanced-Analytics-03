{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02617v1\", \"title\": \"PicoPose: Progressive Pixel-to-Pixel Correspondence Learning for Novel\\n  Object Pose Estimation\", \"summary\": \"Novel object pose estimation from RGB images presents a significant challenge\\nfor zero-shot generalization, as it involves estimating the relative 6D\\ntransformation between an RGB observation and a CAD model of an object that was\\nnot seen during training. In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel\\nframework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel\\ncorrespondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the\\nRGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the\\nbest-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly,\\nPicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine\\ntransformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from\\nthe coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine\\ntransformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns\\ncorrespondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained\\ncorrespondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose\\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC.\\nPicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of\\nthe BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects\\nrepresented by CAD models or object reference images.
