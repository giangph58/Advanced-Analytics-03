This method constructs a dual\\ngraph for intra-type message passing reasoning and builds a heterogeneous graph\\nbased on static relationships for inter-type message passing reasoning. The\\nintra-type message passing reasoning model captures the neighborhood\\ninformation of targets and relationships related to the question in the dual\\ngraph, updating the dual graph to obtain intra-type clues for answering the\\nquestion. The inter-type message passing reasoning model captures the\\nneighborhood information of targets and relationships from different categories\\nrelated to the question in the heterogeneous graph, updating the heterogeneous\\ngraph to obtain inter-type clues for answering the question. Finally, the\\nanswers are inferred by combining the intra-type and inter-type clues based on\\nstatic relationships. Experimental results on the ANetQA and Next-QA datasets\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this method.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:14:41Z\"}"}
