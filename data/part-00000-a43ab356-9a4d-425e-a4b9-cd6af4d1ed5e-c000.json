{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07619v1\", \"title\": \"Beating Transformers using Synthetic Cognition\", \"summary\": \"The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of\\nepisodic reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven\\nto be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning.\\nRecently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called\\nSynthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous\\nreactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic\\nCognition to develop episodic reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to\\ndeal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and\\ntest it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In\\nour experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models,\\nobtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus,\\nwe achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and\\nbeating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:07:05Z\"}"}
