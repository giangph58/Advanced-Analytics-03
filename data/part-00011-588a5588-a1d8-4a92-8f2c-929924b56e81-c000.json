{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01333v1\", \"title\": \"Reconfigurable Codebook-Based Beamforming for RDARS-Aided mmWave MU-MIMO\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a new\\narchitecture for the sixth-generation (6G) millimeter wave (mmWave)\\ncommunications. In RDARS-aided mmWave systems, the active and passive\\nbeamforming design and working mode configuration for reconfigurable elements\\nare crucial for system performance. In this paper, we aim to maximize the\\nweighted sum rate (WSR) in the RDARS-aided mmWave system. To take advantage of\\nRDARS, we first design a reconfigurable codebook (RCB) in which the number and\\ndimension of the codeword can be flexibly adjusted. Then, a low overhead beam\\ntraining scheme based on hierarchical search is proposed. Accordingly, the\\nactive and passive beamforming for data transmission is designed to achieve the\\nmaximum WSR for both space-division multiple access (SDMA) and time-division\\nmultiple access (TDMA) schemes. For the TDMA scheme, the optimal number of\\nRDARS transmit elements and the allocated power budget for WSR maximization are\\nderived in closed form. Besides, the superiority of the RDARS is verified and\\nthe conditions under which RDARS outperforms RIS and DAS are given. For the\\nSDMA scheme, we characterize the relationship between the number of RDARS\\nconnected elements and the user distribution, followed by the derivation of the\\noptimal placement positions of the RDARS transmit elements. High-quality\\nbeamforming design solutions are derived to minimize the inter-user\\ninterference (IUI) at the base station and RDARS side respectively, which\\nnearly leads to the maximal WSR. Finally, simulation results confirm our\\ntheoretical findings and the superiority of the proposed schemes.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:40:37Z\"}"}
