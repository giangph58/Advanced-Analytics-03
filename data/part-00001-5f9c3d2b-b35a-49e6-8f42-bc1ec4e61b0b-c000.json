It is well known that\\nno explicit integrator may remain stable beyond certain limits in $\\\\lambda$.\\nFurthermore, these stability limits are only tight for certain specific\\nintegrators (different in each case), which may then be called `optimally\\nstable'. Such optimal stability results are typically proven using\\nsophisticated techniques from complex analysis, leading to rather abstruse\\nproofs. In this article, we pursue an alternative approach, exploiting\\nconnections with the Bernstein and Markov brothers inequalities for\\npolynomials. This simplifies the proofs greatly and offers a framework which\\nunifies the diverse results that have been obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.HO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:44:49Z\"}"}
