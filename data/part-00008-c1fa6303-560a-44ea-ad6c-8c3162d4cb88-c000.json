We\\napply this concept to the amorphous state, examining as an example the diverse\\ndisordered Na-P phases that can form in sodium-ion battery anodes. Using\\nfirst-principles simulations combined with state-of-the-art machine-learning\\nmethods, we provide atomic-scale insight into the structural and energetic\\nbehaviour of amorphous Na-P phases. We evaluate the applicability of the\\nZintl-Klemm rules in the amorphous state and discuss implications for future\\nwork.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:03:40Z\"}"}
