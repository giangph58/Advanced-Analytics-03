Historically,\\nneuroimaging figures have only depicted regions that surpass a given\\nstatistical threshold. This practice substantially biases interpretation of the\\nresults and subsequent meta-analyses, particularly towards non-reproducibility.\\nHere we advocate for a \\\"transparent thresholding\\\" approach that not only\\nhighlights statistically significant regions but also includes subthreshold\\nlocations, which provide key experimental context. This balances the dual needs\\nof distilling modeling results and enabling informed interpretations for modern\\nneuroimaging. We present four examples that demonstrate the many benefits of\\ntransparent thresholding, including: removing ambiguity, decreasing\\nhypersensitivity to non-physiological features, catching potential artifacts,\\nimproving cross-study comparisons, reducing non-reproducibility biases, and\\nclarifying interpretations. We also demonstrate the many software packages that\\nimplement transparent thresholding, several of which were added or streamlined\\nrecently as part of this work. A point-counterpoint discussion addresses issues\\nwith thresholding raised in real conversations with researchers in the field.\\nWe hope that by showing how transparent thresholding can drastically improve\\nthe interpretation (and reproducibility) of neuroimaging findings, more\\nresearchers will adopt this method.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:01:41Z\"}"}
