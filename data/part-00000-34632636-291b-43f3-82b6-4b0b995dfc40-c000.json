Over the past decades, the application areas and overall\\npotential of simulations in statistical workflows have expanded significantly,\\ndriven by the development of new simulation-based algorithms and exponentially\\nincreasing computational resources. In this paper, we examine past and current\\ntrends in the field and offer perspectives on how simulations may shape the\\nfuture of statistical practice.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:38:21Z\"}"}
