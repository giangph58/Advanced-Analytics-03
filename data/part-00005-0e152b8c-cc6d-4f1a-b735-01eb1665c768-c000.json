Important properties for regularized convex\\nfunctions are given, in particular strong monotonicity of the subdifferential\\nof their convex conjugate and H\\\\\\\"older-continuity of their gradient.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:31:08Z\"}"}
