The equation describing the time evolution of a probability\\ncoefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the\\nKrieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an\\nelectron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced\\ninter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a\\nweighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial\\nacceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation.\\nThe results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized\\nsystems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach\\nthe values one would find without considering the quantization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:40:52Z\"}"}
