{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06730v1\", \"title\": \"PETNet -- Coincident Particle Event Detection using Spiking Neural\\n  Networks\", \"summary\": \"Spiking neural networks (SNN) hold the promise of being a more biologically\\nplausible, low-energy alternative to conventional artificial neural networks.\\nTheir time-variant nature makes them particularly suitable for processing\\ntime-resolved, sparse binary data. In this paper, we investigate the potential\\nof leveraging SNNs for the detection of photon coincidences in positron\\nemission tomography (PET) data. PET is a medical imaging technique based on\\ninjecting a patient with a radioactive tracer and detecting the emitted\\nphotons. One central post-processing task for inferring an image of the tracer\\ndistribution is the filtering of invalid hits occurring due to e.g. absorption\\nor scattering processes. Our approach, coined PETNet, interprets the detector\\nhits as a binary-valued spike train and learns to identify photon coincidence\\npairs in a supervised manner. We introduce a dedicated multi-objective loss\\nfunction and demonstrate the effects of explicitly modeling the detector\\ngeometry on simulation data for two use-cases. Our results show that PETNet can\\noutperform the state-of-the-art classical algorithm with a maximal coincidence\\ndetection $F_1$ of 95.2%. At the same time, PETNet is able to predict photon\\ncoincidences up to 36 times faster than the classical approach, highlighting\\nthe great potential of SNNs in particle physics applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:38:45Z\"}"}
