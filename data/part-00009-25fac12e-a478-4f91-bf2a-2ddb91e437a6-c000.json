{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04821v1\", \"title\": \"A Customized SAT-based Solver for Graph Coloring\", \"summary\": \"We introduce ZykovColor, a novel SAT-based algorithm to solve the graph\\ncoloring problem working on top of an encoding that mimics the Zykov tree. Our\\nmethod is based on an approach of H\\\\'ebrard and Katsirelos (2020) that employs\\na propagator to enforce transitivity constraints, incorporate lower bounds for\\nsearch tree pruning, and enable inferred propagations. We leverage the recently\\nintroduced IPASIR-UP interface for CaDiCal to implement these techniques with a\\nSAT solver. Furthermore, we propose new features that take advantage of the\\nunderlying SAT solver. These include modifying the integrated decision strategy\\nwith vertex domination hints and using incremental bottom-up search that allows\\nto reuse learned clauses from previous calls. Additionally, we integrate a more\\nefficient clique computation to improve the lower bounds during the search. We\\nvalidate the effectiveness of each new feature through an experimental\\nanalysis. ZykovColor outperforms other state-of-the-art graph coloring\\nimplementations on the DIMACS benchmark set. Further experiments on random\\nErd\\\\H{o}s-R\\\\'enyi graphs show that our new approach dominates state-of-the-art\\nSAT-based methods for both very sparse and highly dense graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,cs.AI,cs.DS,cs.LO,G.2.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:22:00Z\"}"}
