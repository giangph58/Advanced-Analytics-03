We introduce EvoChain, a\\ncomprehensive framework and dataset designed to track and visualize smart\\ncontract evolution. Building upon data from our previous empirical study,\\nEvoChain models contract relationships using a Neo4j graph database and\\nprovides an interactive web interface for exploration. The framework consists\\nof a data layer, an API layer, and a user interface layer. EvoChain allows\\nstakeholders to analyze contract histories, upgrade paths, and associated\\nvulnerabilities by leveraging these components. Our dataset encompasses\\napproximately 1.3 million upgradeable proxies and nearly 15,000 historical\\nversions, enhancing transparency and trust in blockchain ecosystems by\\nproviding an accessible platform for understanding smart contract evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:41:48Z\"}"}
