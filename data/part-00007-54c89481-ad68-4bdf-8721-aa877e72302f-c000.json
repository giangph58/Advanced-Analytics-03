{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02819v1\", \"title\": \"GMR-Conv: An Efficient Rotation and Reflection Equivariant Convolution\\n  Kernel Using Gaussian Mixture Rings\", \"summary\": \"Symmetry, where certain features remain invariant under geometric\\ntransformations, can often serve as a powerful prior in designing convolutional\\nneural networks (CNNs). While conventional CNNs inherently support\\ntranslational equivariance, extending this property to rotation and reflection\\nhas proven challenging, often forcing a compromise between equivariance,\\nefficiency, and information loss. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture\\nRing Convolution (GMR-Conv), an efficient convolution kernel that smooths\\nradial symmetry using a mixture of Gaussian-weighted rings. This design\\nmitigates discretization errors of circular kernels, thereby preserving robust\\nrotation and reflection equivariance without incurring computational overhead.\\nWe further optimize both the space and speed efficiency of GMR-Conv via a novel\\nparameterization and computation strategy, allowing larger kernels at an\\nacceptable cost. Extensive experiments on eight classification and one\\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that GMR-Conv not only matches conventional\\nCNNs' performance but can also surpass it in applications with orientation-less\\ndata. GMR-Conv is also proven to be more robust and efficient than the\\nstate-of-the-art equivariant learning methods. Our work provides inspiring\\nempirical evidence that carefully applied radial symmetry can alleviate the\\nchallenges of information loss, marking a promising advance in equivariant\\nnetwork architectures.
