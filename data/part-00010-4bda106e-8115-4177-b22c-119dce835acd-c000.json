Among them, high-Chern-number QAH insulators offer\\nmultiple nondissipative current channels, making them crucial for the\\ndevelopment of low-power-consumption electronics. Using first-principles\\ncalculations, we propose that high-Chern-number ($C>1$) QAH insulators can be\\nrealized in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) multilayer films through the combination of\\nmixed stacking orders, eliminating the need for additional buffer layers. The\\nunderlying physical mechanism is validated by calculating real-space-resolved\\nanomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Local AHC is found to be predominantly\\nlocated in regions with consecutive correct stacking orders, contributing to\\nquasi-quantized AHC. Conversely, regions with consecutive incorrect stacking\\ncontribute minimally to the total AHC, which can be attributed to the varied\\ninterlayer coupling in different stacking configurations. Our work provides\\nvaluable insights into the design principle for achieving large Chern numbers,\\nand highlights the role of stacking configurations in manipulating electronic\\nand topological properties in MBT films and its derivatives.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:20:40Z\"}"}
