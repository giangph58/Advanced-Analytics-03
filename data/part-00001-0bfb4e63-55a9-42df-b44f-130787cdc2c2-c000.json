{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and\\n  its Free-fall Test\", \"summary\": \"We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the\\nframework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence\\nprinciple is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the\\ngeneral equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we\\nconsider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the\\nenvironment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that\\nthe trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\\\\textendash\\nPapapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test\\nparticle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the\\ntheory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom\\ninterferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the\\npossible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\\\\times 10^{1}\\n\\\\mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \\\\times\\n10^{-6}\\\\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical\\nfoundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth\\nforce.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:41:00Z\"}"}
