A natural\\nfollow-up question is under which conditions a monomial quasi-hereditary\\nalgebra $(A, \\\\leq_A)$ admits an exact Borel subalgebra in the sense of K\\\\\\\"onig.\\nIn this article, we show that it always admits a Reedy decomposition consisting\\nof an exact Borel subalgebra $B$, which has a basis given by paths, and a dual\\nsubalgebra. Moreover, we give an explicit description of $B$ and show that it\\nis the unique exact Borel subalgebra of $A$ with a basis given by paths.\\nAdditionally, we give a criterion for when $B$ is regular, using a criterion by\\nConde.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:13:02Z\"}"}
