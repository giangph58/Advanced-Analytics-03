Traditional 3GPP handover (HO) schemes,\\nrelying on fixed A3-offset and time-to-trigger (TTT) parameters, struggle to\\nbalance radio link failures (RLFs) and ping-pongs. We propose a data-driven HO\\noptimization framework based on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO)\\nand enhanced with transfer learning to reduce training time and improve\\ngeneralization across different user speeds. Evaluations on a real-world\\ndeployment show that HD-BO outperforms 3GPP set-1 and set-5 benchmarks, while\\ntransfer learning enables rapid adaptation without loss in performance. This\\nhighlights the potential of data-driven, site-specific mobility management in\\nlarge-scale networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:31:20Z\"}"}
