However, LLMs are still\\nfacing challenges when applied to domain-specific areas like\\ntelecommunications, which demands specialized expertise and adaptability to\\nevolving standards. This paper presents a novel framework that combines\\nknowledge graph (KG) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to\\nenhance LLM performance in the telecom domain. The framework leverages a KG to\\ncapture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols,\\nstandards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing\\ntheir relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access\\nand utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response\\ngeneration. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge\\nrepresentation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing\\naccuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex\\ntechnical queries with precision. The proposed KG-RAG model attained an\\naccuracy of 88% for question answering tasks on a frequently used\\ntelecom-specific dataset, compared to 82% for the RAG-only and 48% for the\\nLLM-only approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:58:08Z\"}"}
