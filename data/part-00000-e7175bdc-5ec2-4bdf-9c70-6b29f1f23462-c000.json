{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24224v1\", \"title\": \"Simplified Cofactor Conditions for Cubic to Tetragonal, Orthorhombic,\\n  and Monoclinic Phase Transformations\", \"summary\": \"Cofactor Conditions (CCs) are geometric compatibility conditions\\nmathematically derived from the crystallographic theory of martensitic phase\\ntransformation. The CCs guarantee compatible interfaces between the austenite\\nand the parallelled twin of the martensite with any volume fraction, yielding a\\nwide range of microstructures during phase transformation. In recent times, CCs\\nhave demonstrated tremendous applications in the rational design of low\\nhysteresis/fatigue shape memory alloys and shape memory ceramics. In this\\npaper, we present a simplified form of the CCs for Type I/II twins using the\\neigenspace of transformation stretch tensor and twin axes. We further show the\\nexplicit forms and visualizations of the simplified CCs for Cubic to\\nTetragonal, Cubic to Orthorhombic, and Cubic to Monoclinic I/II phase\\ntransformations. The simplified form has revealed a more straightforward\\ncorrelation between the lattice parameters and the CCs, and thus provides a\\nmore convenient tool for the rational design of phase-transforming materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:38:23Z\"}"}
