Here, we study the chaoticity\\nof the Surface Quasi-geostrophic system, a two-dimensional model for\\ngeophysical flows that displays a direct cascade similar to that of\\nthree-dimensional turbulence. Using high-resolution direct numerical\\nsimulations, we investigate the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the\\nReynolds number and find an anomalous scaling exponent larger than the one\\npredicted by dimensional arguments. We also study the finite-time fluctuation\\nof the Lyapunov exponent by computing the Cram\\\\'er function associated with its\\nprobability distribution. We find that the Cram\\\\'er function attains a\\nself-similar form at large Re.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:23:13Z\"}"}
