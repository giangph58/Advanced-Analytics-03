{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24241v1\", \"title\": \"Asymmetry in Distributions of Accumulated Gains and Losses in Stock\\n  Returns\", \"summary\": \"We study decades-long historic distributions of accumulated S\\\\&P500 returns,\\nfrom daily returns to those over several weeks. The time series of the returns\\nemphasize major upheavals in the markets -- Black Monday, Tech Bubble,\\nFinancial Crisis and Covid Pandemic -- which are reflected in the tail ends of\\nthe distributions. De-trending the overall gain, we concentrate on comparing\\ndistributions of gains and losses. Specifically, we compare the tails of the\\ndistributions, which are believed to exhibit power-law behavior and possibly\\ncontain outliers. Towards this end we find confidence intervals of the linear\\nfits of the tails of the complementary cumulative distribution functions on a\\nlog-log scale, as well as conduct a statistical U-test in order to detect\\noutliers. We also study probability density functions of the full distributions\\nof the returns with the emphasis on their asymmetry. The key empirical\\nobservations are that the mean of de-trended distributions increases\\nnear-linearly with the number of days of accumulation while the overall skew is\\nnegative -- consistent with the heavier tails of losses -- and depends little\\non the number of days of accumulation. At the same time the variance of the\\ndistributions exhibits near-perfect linear dependence on the number of days of\\naccumulation, that is it remains constant if scaled to the latter. Finally, we\\ndiscuss the theoretical framework for understanding accumulated returns. Our\\nmain conclusion is that the current state of theory, which predicts symmetric\\nor near-symmetric distributions of returns cannot explain the aggregate of\\nempirical results.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.ST,econ.TH,physics.data-an\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:54:04Z\"}"}
