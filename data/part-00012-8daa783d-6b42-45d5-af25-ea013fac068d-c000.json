Assuming exact $SU(3)$ symmetry at the level of\\nthe amplitudes leads to a simple parameterization. Using the available\\nexperimental data and, for the first time, mixing effects in the $B_s^0$\\ndecays, we find that the data cannot be described with this assumption. We\\nimprove this parametrization by including {\\\\it factorizable}\\n$SU(3)_\\\\mathrm{F}$-breaking effects. This new approach allows for an excellent\\ndescription of the data, with a fit $p$ value of $32.3\\\\%$. We provide posterior\\npredictions for all observables and identify several decay channels that would\\nsignificantly impact our analysis. Finally, we briefly compare our results with\\nthe predictions of QCD factorization, paving the way to a more detailed\\nanalysis which could provide insights into QCD effects at low energy scales.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:58:14Z\"}"}
