A proper submodule $N$ of\\n$A$-module $M$ is said to be prime submodule if $ax \\\\in N$ where $a \\\\in A, x\\n\\\\in M$, implies $x \\\\in N$ or $aM \\\\subseteq N$. A proper submodule $N \\\\subset M$\\nis said to be weakly prime submodule if $0 \\\\neq ax \\\\in N$ where $a \\\\in A, x \\\\in\\nM$, then either $x \\\\in N$ or $aM \\\\subseteq N$. The notion of weakly prime\\nsubmodule was introduced by Atani and Farzalipour \\\\cite{atani2007weakly}. The\\npurpose of this paper is to study the form of prime and weakly prime submodules\\nof duplication of the $A$-module $M$ along the ideal $I$ (denoted by $M \\\\bowtie\\nI$), introduced and studied by E. M. Bouba, N. Mahdou and M. Tamekkante. A\\nnumber of results concerning prime and weakly prime submodules on amalgamated\\nduplication and examples are given.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:38:23Z\"}"}
