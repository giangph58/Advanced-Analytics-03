This is apparent in safety-critical applications\\nsuch as human-robot interaction and assisted driving, where uncertainty arises\\nnot only from unknown adversary strategies but also from external disturbances.\\nTo address this, the paper proposes a robust adaptive control approach based on\\nlinear quadratic differential games. Our method allows a controlled agent to\\niteratively refine its belief about the adversary strategy and disturbances\\nusing a set-membership approach, while simultaneously adapting its policy to\\nguarantee robustness against the uncertain adversary policy and improve\\nperformance over time. We formally derive theoretical guarantees on the\\nrobustness of the proposed control scheme and its convergence to epsilon-Nash\\nstrategies. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a numerical\\nsimulation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:15:46Z\"}"}
