{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06121v1\", \"title\": \"A Robust Real-Time Lane Detection Method with Fog-Enhanced Feature\\n  Fusion for Foggy Conditions\", \"summary\": \"Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\\n(ADAS). Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under\\nfavorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly\\nin adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic\\naccidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and\\nmethods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the\\nFoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two\\nadditional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane\\ndetection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for\\nlane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture\\nglobal relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to\\nmodel the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a\\nLow-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy\\nconditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on\\nFoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple. Additionally, with TensorRT\\nacceleration, the method reaches a processing speed of 38.4 FPS on the NVIDIA\\nJetson AGX Orin, confirming its real-time capabilities and robustness in foggy\\nenvironments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:13:01Z\"}"}
