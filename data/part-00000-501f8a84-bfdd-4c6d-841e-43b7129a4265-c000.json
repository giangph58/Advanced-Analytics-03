The nonlinear force-free\\nfield (NLFFF) extrapolated from the photospheric magnetic field about 1 hour\\nbefore the flare was used as the initial condition for the MHD simulations. The\\nNLFFF reproduces highly sheared field lines that undergo tether-cutting\\nreconnection in the MHD simulation, leading to the formation of a highly\\ntwisted magnetic flux rope (MFR), which then erupts rapidly driven by both\\ntorus instability and magnetic reconnection. This paper focuses on the dynamics\\nof the MFR and its role in eruptions. We find that magnetic reconnection in the\\npre-eruption phase is crucial in the subsequent eruption driven by the torus\\ninstability. Furthermore, our simulation indicates that magnetic reconnection\\nalso directly enhances the torus instability. These results suggest that\\nmagnetic reconnection is not just a byproduct of the eruption due to\\nreconnecting of post-flare arcade, but also plays a significant role in\\naccelerating the MFR during the eruption.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:12:15Z\"}"}
