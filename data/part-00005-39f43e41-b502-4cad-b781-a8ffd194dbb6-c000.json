We do this by proving that the unitary dual of simple algebraic\\ngroups is filtered by the integrability parameter of matrix coefficients. This\\nis a filtration of closed ideals that captures every closed subset of the dual\\nthat doesn't contain the trivial representation. In other words, we show that a\\nrepresentation has a spectral gap if and only if there exists some $p < \\\\infty$\\nsuch that its matrix coefficients are in $L^{p+\\\\epsilon}(G)$ for every\\n$\\\\epsilon>0$. Doing this, we continue the work of Bader and Sauer in this area\\nand prove a conjecture they phrased. We also use this principle to give an\\naffirmative solution to a conjecture raised by Bekka and Valette: the image of\\nthe restriction map from a semisimple group to a lattice is never dense in Fell\\ntopology.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:24:44Z\"}"}
