The traditional property leasing process\\nguarantees no trust between parties, uses insecure communication channels, and\\nforces participants who are not familiar with the process to perform contracts.\\nBlockchain technology emerges as a solution to simplify the traditional\\nproperty leasing process. This work proposes the use of two blockchain oracles\\nto handle, respectively, maintenance issues and automate rent payments in the\\ncontext of property rental.
