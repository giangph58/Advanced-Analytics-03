We build an experimental\\nversion of Einstein's elevator, which simulated the effects of free-fall in an\\naccelerated reference frame: a detailed description of the experimental\\napparatus and its construction is provided, highlighting the challenges and\\ninnovations in creating a simple yet functional setup using everyday materials.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:25:08Z\"}"}
