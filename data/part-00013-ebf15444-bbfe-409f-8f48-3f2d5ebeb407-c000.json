{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02388v1\", \"title\": \"Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing\", \"summary\": \"The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical\\nTraveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes,\\nwhich are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that\\ncan be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the\\ntotal travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum\\napproach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using\\nD-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance\\ncomputational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively\\nreduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this\\nreduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the\\nQuadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for\\nquantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore,\\nthe results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and\\ninnovative approach for solving the STSP.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.AI,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:29:57Z\"}"}
