{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06025v1\", \"title\": \"Geometries with trialities arising from linear spaces\", \"summary\": \"A triality is a sort of super-symmetry that exchanges the types of the\\nelements of an incidence geometry in cycles of length three. Although\\ngeometries with trialities exhibit fascinating behaviors, their construction is\\nchallenging, making them rare in the literature. To understand trialities more\\ndeeply, it is crucial to have a wide variety of examples at hand. In this\\narticle, we introduce a general method for constructing various rank-three\\nincidence systems with trialities. Specifically, for any rank two incidence\\nsystem $\\\\Gamma$, we define its triangle complex $\\\\Delta(\\\\Gamma)$, a rank three\\nincidence system whose elements consist of three copies of the flags (pairs of\\nincident elements) of $\\\\Gamma$. This triangle complex always admits a triality\\nthat cyclically permutes the three copies. We then explore in detail the\\nproperties of the triangle complex when $\\\\Gamma$ is a linear space, including\\nflag-transitivity, the existence of dualities, and connectivity properties. As\\na consequence of our work, this construction yields the first infinite family\\nof thick, flag-transitive and residually connected geometries with trialities\\nbut no dualities.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:28:55Z\"}"}
