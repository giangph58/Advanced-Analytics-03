We analyzed these\\nfrom the hyperfine splitting of $S$-wave heavy-flavored, heavy-light and light\\n(except non-strange) mesons in the framework of a relativistic independent\\nquark (RIQ) model with one gluon exchange and centre-of-mass correction. These\\nmesons with spin parity $J^P=0^-$ and $1^-$, the masses obtained are in\\naccordance with the experimental physical masses. The results will serve as\\ngood complementary tools in further study of hadron dynamics and will behave as\\na foundation for the higher excited and exotic states of hadrons.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:25:04Z\"}"}
