Despite the broad research body in the area, which\\nconsiders different classes of constraints and uncertainties, its applicability\\nis confined to relatively simple problems that can be comfortably addressed by\\nthe underpinning mathematically-based or heuristic-driven solver engines. In\\nthis paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that effectively solves the task\\nplanning problem by decomposing it into two intertwined parts, starting with\\nthe identification of a feasible plan and followed by its uncertainty\\naugmentation and verification yielding a set of Pareto optimal plans. To\\nenhance its robustness, adaptation tactics are devised for the evolving system\\nrequirements and agents' capabilities. We demonstrate our approach through an\\nindustrial case study involving workers and robots undertaking activities\\nwithin a vineyard, showcasing the benefits of our hybrid approach both in the\\ngeneration of feasible solutions and scalability compared to native planners.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MA\", \"categories\": \"cs.MA,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:07:15Z\"}"}
