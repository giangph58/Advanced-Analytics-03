It is shown that in the\\nprocesses $\\\\tau \\\\to \\\\pi \\\\pi \\\\eta(\\\\eta')\\\\nu_\\\\tau$ the vector channel is\\ndominant, and in the processes $\\\\tau \\\\to \\\\pi\\\\eta\\\\eta(\\\\eta')\\\\nu_\\\\tau$ the main\\ncontribution is given by the axial vector channel. The scalar meson $a_0$ plays\\na dominant role in processes with two $\\\\eta$-mesons in the final state. The\\nsignificance of the relative phase between the ground and first radially\\nexcited states for these processes is shown. The obtained results for the $\\\\tau\\n\\\\to \\\\pi \\\\pi \\\\eta\\\\nu_\\\\tau$ process are in satisfactory agreement with the recent\\nexperimental data from BaBar and CMD-3, which differ from the averaged values\\ngiven in the PDG tables.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:55:53Z\"}"}
