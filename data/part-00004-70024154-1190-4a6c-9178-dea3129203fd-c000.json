This investigation is grounded in the\\nbenchmark points that comply with experimental constraints, allowing us to\\nsystematically account for uncertainties inherent in the analysis. Our results\\nindicate significant production prospects for the process $H^{+}H^{-}\\n\\\\rightarrow \\\\tau \\\\nu_{\\\\tau} \\\\tau \\\\nu_{\\\\tau}$, which could provide essential\\ninsights into the properties of $H^{\\\\pm}$ bosons. By examining these decay\\nchannels, we aim to illuminate the interplay between the charged Higgs boson\\nand the established Standard Model. The research uses machine learning methods\\nlike Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), as well as\\nLikelihood and LikelihoodD, to improve the identification of heavy charged\\nHiggs bosons compared to Standard Model backgrounds at a 3.0 TeV $\\\\gamma\\\\gamma$\\ncollider with an integrated luminosity of $\\\\mathcal{L}_{int}=3000~fb^{-1}$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:46:27Z\"}"}
