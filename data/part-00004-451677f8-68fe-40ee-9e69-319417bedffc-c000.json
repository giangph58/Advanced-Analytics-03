This study proposes a simple\\ndata-driven approach to extract key predictors from a dataset of historical\\nextreme European winter windstorms and derive simple equations linking these\\nprecursors to extreme gusts over land. A major challenge is the limited\\ntraining data for extreme events, increasing the risk of model overfitting.\\nTesting various mitigation strategies, we find that combining dimensionality\\nreduction, careful cross-validation, feature selection, and a nonlinear\\ntransformation of maximum wind gusts informed by Generalized Extreme Value\\ndistributions successfully reduces overfitting. These measures yield\\ninterpretable equations that generalize across regions while maintaining\\nsatisfactory predictive skill. The discovered equations reveal the association\\nbetween a steady drying low-troposphere before landfall and wind gust intensity\\nin Northwestern Europe.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:28:22Z\"}"}
