Specifically, we use a RL model based on the\\nattention-mechanism architecture to find the columns with most negative reduced\\ncost in the Pricing Problem (PP). Unlike previous Machine Learning (ML)\\napplications for CG, our model deploys an end-to-end mechanism as it\\nindependently solves the pricing problem without the help of any heuristic. We\\nconsider a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) as a case study for our\\nmethod. Through a set of experiments where our method is compared against a\\nDynamic Programming (DP)-based heuristic for solving the PP, we show that our\\nmethod solves the linear relaxation up to a reasonable objective gap within 9%\\nin significantly shorter running times, up to over 300 times faster for\\ninstances with 100 customers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:22:19Z\"}"}
