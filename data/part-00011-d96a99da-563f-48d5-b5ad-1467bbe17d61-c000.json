However, issues such as missing entries during\\nacquisition and transmission negatively impact the accuracy of subsequent\\ntasks. Tensor reconstruction aims to recover the underlying complete data from\\nunder-sampled observed data by exploring prior information in high-dimensional\\ndata. However, due to insufficient exploration, reconstruction methods still\\nface challenges when sampling rate is extremely low. This work proposes a\\ntensor reconstruction method integrating multiple priors to comprehensively\\nexploit the inherent structure of the data. Specifically, the method combines\\nlearnable tensor decomposition to enforce low-rank constraints of the\\nreconstructed data, a pre-trained convolutional neural network for smoothing\\nand denoising, and block-matching and 3D filtering regularization to enhance\\nthe non-local similarity in the reconstructed data. An alternating direction\\nmethod of the multipliers algorithm is designed to decompose the resulting\\noptimization problem into three subproblems for efficient resolution. Extensive\\nexperiments on color images, hyperspectral images, and grayscale videos\\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in extreme cases as compared\\nwith state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:55:18Z\"}"}
