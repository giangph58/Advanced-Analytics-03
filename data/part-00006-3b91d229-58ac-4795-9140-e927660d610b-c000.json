ZKPs enable a proving party to\\nprove the truth of a statement to a verifying party without revealing anything\\nelse. ZKPs have applications in blockchain technologies, verifiable machine\\nlearning, and electronic voting, but have yet to see widespread adoption due to\\nthe computational complexity of the proving process. Recent works have\\naccelerated the key primitives of state-of-the-art ZKP protocols on GPU and\\nASIC. However, the protocols accelerated thus far face one of two challenges:\\nthey either require a trusted setup for each application, or they generate\\nlarger proof sizes with higher verification costs, limiting their applicability\\nin scenarios with numerous verifiers or strict verification time constraints.\\nThis work presents an accelerator, zkSpeed, for HyperPlonk, a state-of-the-art\\nZKP protocol that supports both one-time, universal setup and small proof sizes\\nfor typical ZKP applications in publicly verifiable, consensus-based systems.\\nWe accelerate the entire protocol, including two major primitives: SumCheck and\\nMulti-scalar Multiplications (MSMs). We develop a full-chip architecture using\\n366.46 mm$^2$ and 2 TB/s of bandwidth to accelerate the entire proof generation\\nprocess, achieving geometric mean speedups of 801$\\\\times$ over CPU baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:56:10Z\"}"}
