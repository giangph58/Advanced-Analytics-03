This is dual to the usual noisy channel coding problem, where a\\nnoisy (classical or quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one. The\\nQuantum Reverse Shannon Theorem is extensively studied by Bennett and\\nco-authors in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2014]. They present two distinct\\ntheorems, each tailored to classical and quantum channel simulations\\nrespectively, explaining the fact that these theorems remain incomparable due\\nto the fundamentally different nature of correlations they address. The authors\\nleave as an open question the challenge of formulating a unified theorem that\\ncould encompass the principles of both and unify them. We unify these two\\ntheorems into a single, comprehensive theorem, extending it to the most general\\ncase by considering correlations with a general mixed-state reference system.\\nFurthermore, we unify feedback and non-feedback theorems by simulating a\\ngeneral side information system at the encoder side.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:37:20Z\"}"}
