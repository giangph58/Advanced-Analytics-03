{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06650v1\", \"title\": \"ThoughtProbe: Classifier-Guided Thought Space Exploration Leveraging LLM\\n  Intrinsic Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to possess\\nintrinsic reasoning capabilities that can emerge naturally when expanding the\\nresponse space. However, the neural representation mechanisms underlying these\\nintrinsic capabilities and approaches for their optimal utilization remain\\ninadequately understood. In this work, we make the key discovery that a simple\\nlinear classifier can effectively detect intrinsic reasoning capabilities in\\nLLMs' activation space, particularly within specific representation types and\\nnetwork layers. Based on this finding, we propose a classifier-guided search\\nframework that strategically explore a tree-structured response space. In each\\nnode expansion, the classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that\\nefficiently allocates computational resources by identifying and prioritizing\\nmore thoughtful reasoning directions for continuation. After completing the\\ntree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer\\npool. We propose a branch-aggregation selection method that marginalizes over\\nall supporting branches by aggregating their thoughtfulness scores, thereby\\nidentifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that\\nour framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning\\nchains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements\\nacross multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:37:27Z\"}"}
