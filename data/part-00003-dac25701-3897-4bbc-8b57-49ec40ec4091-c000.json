We aim to achieve realistic model\\nappearances under varying lighting conditions. A prominent solution for the\\ntask is score distillation sampling. It allows recovering a complex texture\\nusing gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading\\npipeline. However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with\\nthe widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and\\nrequires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization.\\nAs a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion\\nmodels for texture synthesis (CasTex). In our setup, score distillation\\nsampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box. In particular, we were\\nable to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit\\nparameterization to improve the procedure. In the experiments, we show that our\\napproach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based\\nsolutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:08:30Z\"}"}
