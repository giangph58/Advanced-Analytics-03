{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01576v1\", \"title\": \"Strong Nonlinear Flexoelectricity in Bulk Ferroelectrics\", \"summary\": \"Flexoelectricity induced by strain gradient in dielectrics is highly\\ndesirable for electromechanical actuating and sensing systems. It is broadly\\nadopted that flexoelectric polarization responds linearly to strain gradient\\nwithout considering nonlinearity. Consequently, the implication of nonlinear\\nflexoelectricity in electromechanical systems remains unclear. Herein, we\\nestablish a nonlinear constitutive model for flexoelectricity and thereby\\npropose a strategy for quantitatively measuring its nonlinearity through the\\nhigh-order harmonic generations. A strong nonlinear flexoelectricity in bulk\\nferroelectrics is revealed and its coefficient is determined, as evidenced by\\ntheir nonlinear dependence of harmonics on strain gradient. On this basis, we\\nillustrate the nonlinear flexoelectricity manifests a functionality to\\ntransduce mixed mechanical excitations into coherent electrical signals\\nfeaturing difference- and sum-frequencies, thereby offering utilization in\\nsignal processing for frequency conversion. These findings emphasize the\\nsignificance of nonlinear flexoelectricity in ferroelectrics and open up new\\nopportunities for designing electromechanical transducer based on nonlinear\\nflexoelectricity.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:28:56Z\"}"}
