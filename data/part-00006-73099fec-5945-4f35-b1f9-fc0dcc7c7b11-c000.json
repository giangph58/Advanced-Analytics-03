{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01653v1\", \"title\": \"Quasinormal Modes and Stability Analysis of the JMN-1 Naked Singularity\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes\\nin the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity by investigating its\\nresponse to linear perturbations, including scalar, electromagnetic, and\\ngravitational perturbations. To analyze the stability of the JMN-1 naked\\nsingularity under axial perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode\\nfrequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. The quasinormal mode\\nfrequencies provides information about the stability of spacetime, with the\\nreal part of the frequency determining the oscillation rate and the imaginary\\npart governing the decay or growth of perturbations. Our results indicate that\\nby imposing appropriate boundary conditions, we find that the JMN-1 spacetime\\nremains dynamically stable under axial perturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:02:34Z\"}"}
