It is based on the Gribov-Glauber model for the\\ndistribution over the number of inelastic collisions (wounded nucleons)\\ncombined with a parametrization of cross section (color) fluctuations in the\\nprojectile proton, which depend on the parton momentum fraction $x_p$, and the\\nassumption of independent neutron emissions. It allows us to qualitatively\\nexplain the ATLAS data on the ZDC energy spectra of forward neutrons emitted in\\ndijet production in inelastic $pA$ scattering at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:18:20Z\"}"}
