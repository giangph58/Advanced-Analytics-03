{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24083v1\", \"title\": \"Controlled Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Porous Media Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a\\nfundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of\\nfine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes.\\nWe introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through\\nlatent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach\\nreduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary\\ngeological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of\\nlarger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation\\nis our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances\\ndistribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical\\ndistributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive\\ntesting on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity\\n- a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent\\nrepresentation of multiple complex properties, including permeability,\\ntwo-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework\\nachieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling\\nsignificantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially\\nreduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for\\ndigital rock physics applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:36:55Z\"}"}
