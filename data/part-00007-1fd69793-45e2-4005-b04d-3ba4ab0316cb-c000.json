{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02296v1\", \"title\": \"Exceedance and force of centrality for functional data\", \"summary\": \"Exceedance refers to instances where a dynamic process surpasses given\\nthresholds, e.g., the occurrence of a heat wave. We propose a novel exceedance\\nframework for functional data, where each observed random trajectory is\\ntransformed into an exceedance function, which quantifies exceedance durations\\nas a function of threshold levels. An inherent relationship between exceedance\\nfunctions and probability distributions makes it possible to draw on\\ndistributional data analysis techniques such as Fr\\\\'echet regression to study\\nthe dependence of exceedances on Euclidean predictors, e.g., calendar year when\\nthe exceedances are observed. We use local linear estimators to obtain\\nexceedance functions from discretely observed functional data with noise and\\nstudy the convergence of the proposed estimators. New concepts of interest\\ninclude the force of centrality that quantifies the propensity of a system to\\nrevert to lower levels when a given threshold has been exceeded, conditional\\nexceedance functions when conditioning on Euclidean covariates, and threshold\\nexceedance functions, which characterize the size of exceedance sets in\\ndependence on covariates for any fixed threshold. We establish consistent\\nestimation with rates of convergence for these targets. The practical merits of\\nthe proposed methodology are illustrated through simulations and applications\\nfor annual temperature curves and medfly activity profiles.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T05:58:24Z\"}"}
