{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02712v1\", \"title\": \"TeleMoM: Consensus-Driven Telecom Intelligence via Mixture of Models\", \"summary\": \"Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized\\ndomains like telecommunication (Telecom) due to technical complexity,\\nspecialized terminology, and rapidly evolving knowledge. Traditional methods,\\nsuch as scaling model parameters or retraining on domain-specific corpora, are\\ncomputationally expensive and yield diminishing returns, while existing\\napproaches like retrieval-augmented generation, mixture of experts, and\\nfine-tuning struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and coordination. To address\\nthis issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven\\nensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making\\nin Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate\\njustified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a\\nquality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages strengths of diverse models\\nto improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities\\neffectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7\\\\%\\nincrease in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in Telecom\\napplications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:52:20Z\"}"}
