{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06908v1\", \"title\": \"UKBOB: One Billion MRI Labeled Masks for Generalizable 3D Medical Image\\n  Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"In medical imaging, the primary challenge is collecting large-scale labeled\\ndata due to privacy concerns, logistics, and high labeling costs. In this work,\\nwe present the UK Biobank Organs and Bones (UKBOB), the largest labeled dataset\\nof body organs, comprising 51,761 MRI 3D samples (equivalent to 17.9 million 2D\\nimages) and more than 1.37 billion 2D segmentation masks of 72 organs, all\\nbased on the UK Biobank MRI dataset. We utilize automatic labeling, introduce\\nan automated label cleaning pipeline with organ-specific filters, and manually\\nannotate a subset of 300 MRIs with 11 abdominal classes to validate the quality\\n(referred to as UKBOB-manual). This approach allows for scaling up the dataset\\ncollection while maintaining confidence in the labels. We further confirm the\\nvalidity of the labels by demonstrating zero-shot generalization of trained\\nmodels on the filtered UKBOB to other small labeled datasets from similar\\ndomains (e.g., abdominal MRI). To further mitigate the effect of noisy labels,\\nwe propose a novel method called Entropy Test-time Adaptation (ETTA) to refine\\nthe segmentation output. We use UKBOB to train a foundation model, Swin-BOB,\\nfor 3D medical image segmentation based on the Swin-UNetr architecture,\\nachieving state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks in 3D medical imaging,\\nincluding the BRATS brain MRI tumor challenge (with a 0.4% improvement) and the\\nBTCV abdominal CT scan benchmark (with a 1.3% improvement). The pre-trained\\nmodels and the code are available at https://emmanuelleb985.github.io/ukbob ,\\nand the filtered labels will be made available with the UK Biobank.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:10:51Z\"}"}
