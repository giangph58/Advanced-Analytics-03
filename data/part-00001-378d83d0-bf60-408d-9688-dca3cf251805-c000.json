This extends previous work of the same authors, as it allows\\nthe removal of separability hypotheses that were otherwise necessary. The\\nabsence of separability and the fact that modules of $\\\\mathbb{Z}$-linear\\ndifferential operators are typically not finitely generated require the\\nintroduction of new techniques. As a byproduct, we extend a characterization of\\nsymbolic powers due to Cid-Ruiz which also holds in the nonsmooth case.\\nFinally, we produce an example of an unramified discrete valuation ring that\\nhas no $p$-derivations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:59Z\"}"}
