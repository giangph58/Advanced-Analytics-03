{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21656v1\", \"title\": \"Logging the conformal life of Ramanujan's $\\u03c0$\", \"summary\": \"In 1914, Ramanujan presented 17 infinite series for $1/\\\\pi$. We examine the\\nphysics origin of these remarkable formulae by connecting them to 2D\\nlogarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) which arise in various contexts\\nsuch as the fractional quantum hall effect, percolation and polymers. In light\\nof the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the\\nphysics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and\\nthe conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel\\napproximations for $1/\\\\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series\\nmotivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators\\nto find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the\\nparametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed\\nfor string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in\\nthe new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire\\ncontribution to $1/\\\\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting\\nat a universal property of LCFTs. Additionally, the dispersive representation\\ngives us a new handle on the double-lightcone limit.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:21:08Z\"}"}
