Here, we study the\\ntopological properties of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands of excitations in Mn\\nchains constructed on a Nb(110) and on a Ta(110) substrate using\\nfirst-principles calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy and\\nspectroscopy experiments. We demonstrate that even and odd YSR states with\\nrespect to mirroring on the symmetry plane containing the chain have different\\ndispersions, and both of them may give rise to MZMs separately. Although the\\nspin-orbit coupling leads to a hybridization between the bands, multiple MZMs\\nmay still exist due to the mirror symmetry. These findings highlight the\\ninfluence of symmetries on interpreting the spectroscopic signatures of\\ncandidates for MZMs.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:11:26Z\"}"}
