However, current methods typically rely\\non costly 3D scanning with labor-intensive post-processing. To provide a\\nuser-friendly design process, we explore the problem of reverse engineering\\nfrom unconstrained real-world CAD images that can be easily captured by users\\nof all experiences. However, the scarcity of real-world CAD data poses\\nchallenges in directly training such models. To tackle these challenges, we\\npropose CADCrafter, an image-to-parametric CAD model generation framework that\\ntrains solely on synthetic textureless CAD data while testing on real-world\\nimages. To bridge the significant representation disparity between images and\\nparametric CAD models, we introduce a geometry encoder to accurately capture\\ndiverse geometric features. Moreover, the texture-invariant properties of the\\ngeometric features can also facilitate the generalization to real-world\\nscenarios. Since compiling CAD parameter sequences into explicit CAD models is\\na non-differentiable process, the network training inherently lacks explicit\\ngeometric supervision. To impose geometric validity constraints, we employ\\ndirect preference optimization (DPO) to fine-tune our model with the automatic\\ncode checker feedback on CAD sequence quality. Furthermore, we collected a\\nreal-world dataset, comprised of multi-view images and corresponding CAD\\ncommand sequence pairs, to evaluate our method. Experimental results\\ndemonstrate that our approach can robustly handle real unconstrained CAD\\nimages, and even generalize to unseen general objects.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:01:35Z\"}"}
