Infamously, the\\n2015 and 2016 blackouts in Ukraine were caused by cyberattacks, and the German\\nFederal Office for Information Security (BSI) recorded over 200 cyber incidents\\nagainst the German energy sector between 2023 and 2024. Intrusion detection\\npromises to quickly detect such attacks and mitigate the worst consequences.\\nHowever, public datasets of realistic scenarios are vital to evaluate these\\nsystems. This paper introduces Sherlock, a dataset generated with the\\nco-simulator Wattson. In total, Sherlock covers three scenarios with various\\nattacks manipulating the process state by injecting malicious commands or\\nmanipulating measurement values. We additionally test five recently-published\\nintrusion detection systems on Sherlock, highlighting specific challenges for\\nintrusion detection in power grids.
