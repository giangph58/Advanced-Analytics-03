{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24324v1\", \"title\": \"Predicting and Mitigating Agricultural Price Volatility Using Climate\\n  Scenarios and Risk Models\", \"summary\": \"Agricultural price volatility challenges sustainable finance, planning, and\\npolicy, driven by market dynamics and meteorological factors such as\\ntemperature and precipitation. In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system\\nacts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without\\npremium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for\\nsoybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land\\nreanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze\\nhistorical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate\\ncase) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions\\nstrongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data\\ninto volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized\\nAutoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate\\nconditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather\\nand price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put\\noption, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium,\\nquantifying its fiscal cost. We propose this novel market-based risk-hedging\\nmechanism wherein the government purchases insurance equivalent to MSP,\\nleveraging Black-Scholes for accurate premium estimation. Our results\\nunderscore the importance of meteorological data in agricultural risk modeling,\\nsupporting targeted insurance and strengthening resilience in agricultural\\nfinance. This climate-informed financial framework enhances risk-sharing,\\nstabilizes prices, and informs sustainable agricultural policy under growing\\nclimate uncertainty.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,econ.GN,physics.soc-ph,q-fin.EC,q-fin.RM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:11:00Z\"}"}
