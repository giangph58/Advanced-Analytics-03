{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04994v1\", \"title\": \"Following the Whispers of Values: Unraveling Neural Mechanisms Behind\\n  Value-Oriented Behaviors in LLMs\", \"summary\": \"Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), they can\\npresent unintended biases and harmful behaviors driven by encoded values,\\nemphasizing the urgent need to understand the value mechanisms behind them.\\nHowever, current research primarily evaluates these values through external\\nresponses with a focus on AI safety, lacking interpretability and failing to\\nassess social values in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel\\nframework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven\\nmechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case\\nstudy, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a\\nlarge-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social\\nValues in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons\\nresponsible for encoding these values according to activation difference.\\nFinally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior,\\nuncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM\\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the\\nefficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:23:59Z\"}"}
