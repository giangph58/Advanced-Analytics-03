The source had a relatively\\nstable flux level during previous NuSTAR observations, but the flux varied\\nsignificantly during the current one. The light curve exhibits dips (off-state)\\nand flares (on-state). The phase-coherent timing analysis during the on-state\\nyields a pulse period of $443.99(4)~\\\\mathrm{s}$, showing the pulsar's continued\\nspin-down. The pulse profiles show an asymmetric double-peaked structure with a\\nphase separation of 0.47 between the two peaks. A cyclotron resonance\\nscattering feature (CRSF) is also detected at $\\\\sim 17.6~\\\\mathrm{keV}$, along\\nwith its harmonic at $\\\\sim 38~\\\\mathrm{keV}$, persisting across all flux states.\\nFlux-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the CRSF remains constant despite a\\n25-fold change in flux. The spectral parameters like photon index and e-fold\\nenergy are out of phase with the pulse shape, whereas cutoff energy is in phase\\nwith the pulse shape. The source's luminosity during the on-state is $2.85\\n\\\\times 10^{35}~\\\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, consistent with a \\\"pencil\\\" beam radiation\\npattern expected at this flux level from a collisionless gas-mediated shock.\\nThese results offer further insights into the accretion dynamics and magnetic\\nfield geometry of this system.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:38:03Z\"}"}
