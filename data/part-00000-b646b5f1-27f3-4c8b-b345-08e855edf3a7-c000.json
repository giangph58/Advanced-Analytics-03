We take into account dissipation for\\nthe bosonic degrees of freedom in the spirit of the Caldeira-Leggett model by\\ncoupling the system to an $O(4)$ invariant external heat bath. We study the\\neffect of dissipation on static equilibrium properties, most prominently on the\\nFRG flow of the effective potential and thus on the resulting phase diagram. We\\nfind that, unlike in classical systems, through the contributions from non-zero\\nMatsubara modes the dissipative dynamics can in general have an effect on\\nstatic observables. We investigate these effects within two phenomenological\\nmodels for the temperature dependence of the pion damping to verify that they\\nare quantitatively small. To estimate their largest possible influence, we\\nconsider limits where the damping constants approach infinity.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:53:22Z\"}"}
