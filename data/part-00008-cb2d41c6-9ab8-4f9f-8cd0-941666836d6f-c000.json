GRB 230307A, the\\nsecond-brightest long-duration GRB ever detected, exhibits a rare association\\nwith a Kilonova, offering a unique and rare probe into the emission processes\\nof GRBs originating from compact object mergers. We present a comprehensive\\ntime-averaged and time-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis of GRB 230307A\\nusing joint observations from the $AstroSat$ Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager\\n(CZTI), the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and $Konus$-Wind. Spectral\\nanalysis reveals a temporal evolution in the low-energy photon index, $\\\\alpha$,\\ntransitioning from a hard to a softer state over the burst duration.\\nTime-averaged polarimetric measurements yield a low polarization fraction ($<$\\n12.7 %), whereas time-resolved polarization analysis unveils a marked increase\\nin polarization fractions ($>$ 49 %) in the later stages of the emission\\nepisode. This spectro-polarimetric evolution suggests a transition in the\\ndominant radiative mechanism: the initial phase characterized by\\nthermal-dominated photospheric emission (unpolarized or weakly polarized) gives\\nway to a regime dominated by non-thermal synchrotron emission (highly\\npolarized). This transition provides critical evidence for the evolving\\ninfluence of magnetic fields in shaping the GRB emission process and jet\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:01:45Z\"}"}
