{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04898v1\", \"title\": \"SLIDE: Automated Identification and Quantification of Grain Boundary\\n  Sliding and Opening in 3D\", \"summary\": \"Grain Boundary (GB) deformation mechanisms such as Sliding (GBS) and Opening\\n(GBO) are prevalent in alloys at high homologous temperatures but are hard to\\ncapture quantitatively. We propose an automated procedure to quantify 3D GB\\ndeformations at the nanoscale, using a combination of precisely aligned Digital\\nImage Correlation (DIC), electron backscatter diffraction, optical\\nprofilometry, and in-beam secondary electron maps. The framework, named Sliding\\nidentification by Local Integration of Displacements across Edges (SLIDE), (i)\\ndistinguishes GBS from GBO, (ii) computes the datapoint-wise measured in-plane\\ndisplacement gradient tensor (from DIC), (iii) projects this data onto the\\ntheoretical GBS tensor to reject near-GB plasticity/elasticity/noise, and (iv)\\nadds the out-of-plane step from optical profilometry to yield the local 3D\\nGBS/GBO vector; automatically repeated for each $\\\\sim$50nm-long GB segment.\\nSLIDE is validated on a virtual experiment of discrete 3D sliding, and\\nsuccessfully applied to Zn-coated steel experiments, yielding quantitative\\nGBS/GBO activity maps.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:14:25Z\"}"}
