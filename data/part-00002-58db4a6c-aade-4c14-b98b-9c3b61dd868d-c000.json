{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06928v1\", \"title\": \"Beyond Tools: Generative AI as Epistemic Infrastructure in Education\", \"summary\": \"As generative AI rapidly integrates into educational infrastructures\\nworldwide, it transforms how knowledge gets created, validated, and shared, yet\\ncurrent discourse inadequately addresses its implications as epistemic\\ninfrastructure mediating teaching and learning. This paper investigates how AI\\nsystems function as epistemic infrastructures in education and their impact on\\nhuman epistemic agency. Adopting a situated cognition perspective and following\\na value-sensitive design approach, the study conducts a technical investigation\\nof two representative AI systems in educational settings, analyzing their\\nimpact on teacher practice across three dimensions: affordances for skilled\\nepistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for\\nlong-term habit formation. The analysis reveals that current AI systems\\ninadequately support teachers' skilled epistemic actions, insufficiently foster\\nepistemic sensitivity, and potentially cultivate problematic habits that\\nprioritize efficiency over epistemic agency. To address these challenges, the\\npaper recommends recognizing the infrastructural transformation occurring in\\neducation, developing AI environments that stimulate skilled actions while\\nupholding epistemic norms, and involving educators in AI design processes --\\nrecommendations aimed at fostering AI integration that aligns with core\\neducational values and maintains human epistemic agency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:35:30Z\"}"}
