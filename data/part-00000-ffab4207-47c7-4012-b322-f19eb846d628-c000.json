{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24149v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Trust in Inter-Organisational Data Sharing: Levels of\\n  Assurance for Data Trustworthiness\", \"summary\": \"As data is increasingly acknowledged as a highly valuable asset, much effort\\nhas been put into investigating inter-organisational data sharing, aiming at\\nutilising the value of formerly unused data. Moreover, most researchers agree,\\nthat trust between actors is key for successful data sharing activities.\\nHowever, existing research oftentimes focus on trust from a data provider\\nperspective. Therefore, our work highlights the unbalanced view of trust,\\naddressing it from a data consumer perspective. More specifically, our aim is\\nto investigate trust enhancing measures on a data level, that is data\\ntrustworthiness. We found, that existing data trustworthiness enhancing\\nsolutions do not meet the requirements of the domain of inter-organisational\\ndata sharing. Therefore, our study addresses this gap. Conducting a rigorous\\ndesign science research approach, this work proposes a new Levels of Assurance\\nfor Data Trustworthiness artifact. Built on existing artifacts, we demonstrate,\\nhow it addresses the identified challenges within the domain appropriately. We\\nfound that our novel approach requires more work to be suitable for adoption.\\nStill, we are confident that our solution can increase consumer trust. We\\nconclude by contributing to the body of design knowledge and emphasise the need\\nfor more attention to be put into consumer trust.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI,cs.CY,econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:35:23Z\"}"}
