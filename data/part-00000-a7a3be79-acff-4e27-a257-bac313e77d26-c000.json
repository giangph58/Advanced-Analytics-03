In this paper, I review the experimental findings on\\nCa3ReO5Cl2 and related com-pounds that exhibit remarkable pleochroism and novel\\nquantum magnetism. I discuss how the heteroanionic coordination affects the\\noptical and magnetic properties by modulating the d-orbital states of the\\ntransition metal ions and then compare these materials with other heteroanionic\\nand monoanionic compounds and highlight the potential of A3MO5X2 materials for\\nfuture exploration of materials and phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:51:35Z\"}"}
