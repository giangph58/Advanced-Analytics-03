{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01652v1\", \"title\": \"Market-Oriented Flow Allocation for Thermal Solar Plants: An\\n  Auction-Based Methodology with Artificial Intelligence\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel method to optimize thermal balance in parabolic\\ntrough collector (PTC) plants. It uses a market-based system to distribute flow\\namong loops combined with an artificial neural network (ANN) to reduce\\ncomputation and data requirements. This auction-based approach balances loop\\ntemperatures, accommodating varying thermal losses and collector efficiencies.\\nValidation across different thermal losses, optical efficiencies, and\\nirradiance conditions-sunny, partially cloudy, and cloudy-show improved thermal\\npower output and intercept factors compared to a no-allocation system. It\\ndemonstrates scalability and practicality for large solar thermal plants,\\nenhancing overall performance. The method was first validated through\\nsimulations on a realistic solar plant model, then adapted and successfully\\ntested in a 50 MW solar trough plant, demonstrating its advantages.\\nFurthermore, the algorithms have been implemented, commissioned, and are\\ncurrently operating in 13 commercial solar trough plants.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.AI,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:01:41Z\"}"}
