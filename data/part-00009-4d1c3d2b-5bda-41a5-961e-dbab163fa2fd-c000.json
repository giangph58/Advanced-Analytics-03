Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular,\\ntechnology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality\\nin an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other\\nagents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions\\nthis framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to\\naccelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world\\napplication, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that\\nwithin a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value =\\n$6.4\\\\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication\\ncost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems\\nand compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant\\nprocess of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:33:24Z\"}"}
