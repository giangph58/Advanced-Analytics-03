Motivated by recent formulations of the Optimized Schwarz\\nMethod introduced by Claeys, we rigorously analyze the behavior of a family of\\nnon-local exchange operators $\\\\Pi_\\\\gamma$, defined in terms of boundary\\nintegral operators associated to the fundamental solution for $-\\\\Delta +\\n\\\\gamma^{-2}$, with $\\\\gamma > 0$. Our first main result establishes precise\\nestimates comparing $\\\\Pi_\\\\gamma$ to its local counterpart $\\\\Pi_0$ as $\\\\gamma\\n\\\\to 0$, providing a quantitative bridge between the classical and non-local\\nformulations of the Optimized Schwarz Method. In addition, we investigate the\\ncorresponding scattering operators, proving norm estimates that relate them to\\ntheir classical analogues through a detailed analysis of the associated\\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operators. Our results clarify the relationship between\\nclassical and non-local formulations of domain decomposition methods and yield\\nnew insights that are essential for the analysis of these algorithms,\\nparticularly in the presence of cross points and for domains with curvilinear\\npolygonal boundaries.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:54:54Z\"}"}
