{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05640v1\", \"title\": \"CTI-Unet: Cascaded Threshold Integration for Improved U-Net Segmentation\\n  of Pathology Images\", \"summary\": \"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health concern,\\nnecessitating precise and efficient image analysis to aid diagnosis and\\ntreatment planning. Automated segmentation of kidney pathology images plays a\\ncentral role in facilitating clinical workflows, yet conventional segmentation\\nmodels often require delicate threshold tuning. This paper proposes a novel\\n\\\\textit{Cascaded Threshold-Integrated U-Net (CTI-Unet)} to overcome the\\nlimitations of single-threshold segmentation. By sequentially integrating\\nmultiple thresholded outputs, our approach can reconcile noise suppression with\\nthe preservation of finer structural details. Experiments on the challenging\\nKPIs2024 dataset demonstrate that CTI-Unet outperforms state-of-the-art\\narchitectures such as nnU-Net, Swin-Unet, and CE-Net, offering a robust and\\nflexible framework for kidney pathology image segmentation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:35:09Z\"}"}
