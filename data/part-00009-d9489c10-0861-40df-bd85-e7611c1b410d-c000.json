Specifically, three distinct models are\\nanalyzed: a simplified toy model, a model featuring an exponential quintom\\npotential, and one where the quintom field is coupled with a negative\\ncosmological constant. For each case, we study the classical trajectories\\nwithin the configuration space, present solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt\\nequation in quantum cosmology, and discuss physical interpretations and\\nconsequences. A key focus is the behavior of wave packets in the minisuperspace\\nframework. Notably, the correspondence principle (connection between classical\\nand quantum solutions) is also demonstrated.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:52:26Z\"}"}
