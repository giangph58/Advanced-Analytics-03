By leveraging matrix product states to compress\\nthe quantum state representation, we simulate an N + 1-spin circular Ising\\nmodel with a transverse field. Furthermore, we develop an analog error\\nmitigation approach through zero-noise extrapolation by introducing a precise\\nnoise injection technique for the transmon qubit. As a validation, we apply our\\nerror-mitigated qubit-efficient VQE in determining the ground state energies of\\na 4-spin Ising model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of performing\\nquantum algorithms with minimal quantum resources while effectively mitigating\\nthe impact of noise, offering a promising pathway to bridge the gap between\\ntheoretical advances and practical implementations on current noisy\\nintermediate-scale quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:23:26Z\"}"}
