Based on\\nexperimental biaxial tensile test data of healthy human atria, we automatically\\ndiscover the most appropriate constitutive material model, thereby overcoming\\nthe limitations of traditional, pre-defined models. This approach offers a new\\nperspective on modeling atrial mechanics and is a significant step towards\\nimproved simulation and prediction of cardiac health.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cond-mat.soft,cs.LG,physics.med-ph,q-bio.TO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:35:49Z\"}"}
