{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24327v1\", \"title\": \"Thermal transport in superconductor heterostructures: some recent\\n  progress\", \"summary\": \"This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal\\ntransport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures\\nfocusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism\\nhas been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based\\non ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric\\neffects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry\\nof the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction.\\nRecently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that\\nemerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced\\napplications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and\\naltermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal\\nand charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary\\nsuperconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been\\nexplored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers\\nhas been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials,\\nincluding Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally\\nbiased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in\\nrecent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and\\nvarious other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large\\nthermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications\\nin superconductor-based thermal device components.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:17:25Z\"}"}
