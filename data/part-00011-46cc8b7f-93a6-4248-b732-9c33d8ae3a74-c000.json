{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07516v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancements for Developing a Comprehensive AI Fairness Assessment\\n  Standard\", \"summary\": \"As AI systems increasingly influence critical sectors like\\ntelecommunications, finance, healthcare, and public services, ensuring fairness\\nin decision-making is essential to prevent biased or unjust outcomes that\\ndisproportionately affect vulnerable entities or result in adverse impacts.\\nThis need is particularly pressing as the industry approaches the 6G era, where\\nAI will drive complex functions like autonomous network management and\\nhyper-personalized services. The TEC Standard for Fairness Assessment and\\nRating of AI Systems provides guidelines for evaluating fairness in AI,\\nfocusing primarily on tabular data and supervised learning models. However, as\\nAI applications diversify, this standard requires enhancement to strengthen its\\nimpact and broaden its applicability. This paper proposes an expansion of the\\nTEC Standard to include fairness assessments for images, unstructured text, and\\ngenerative AI, including large language models, ensuring a more comprehensive\\napproach that keeps pace with evolving AI technologies. By incorporating these\\ndimensions, the enhanced framework will promote responsible and trustworthy AI\\ndeployment across various sectors.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:24:23Z\"}"}
