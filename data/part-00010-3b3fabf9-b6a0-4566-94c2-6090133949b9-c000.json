{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01616v1\", \"title\": \"The Mini-SiTian Array: Imaging Processing Pipeline\", \"summary\": \"As a pathfinder of the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) array, employed\\nthree commercial CMOS cameras, represents a next-generation, cost-effective\\noptical time-domain survey project. This paper focuses primarily on the precise\\ndata processing pipeline designed for wide-field, CMOS-based devices, including\\nthe removal of instrumental effects, astrometry, photometry, and flux\\ncalibration. When applying this pipeline to approximately 3000 observations\\ntaken in the Field 02 (f02) region by MST, the results demonstrate a remarkable\\nastrometric precision of approximately 70--80\\\\,mas (about 0.1\\\\,pixel), an\\nimpressive calibration accuracy of approximately 1\\\\,mmag in the MST zero\\npoints, and a photometric accuracy of about 4\\\\,mmag for bright stars. Our\\nstudies demonstrate that MST CMOS can achieve photometric accuracy comparable\\nto that of CCDs, highlighting the feasibility of large-scale CMOS-based optical\\ntime-domain surveys and their potential applications for cost optimization in\\nfuture large-scale time-domain surveys, like the SiTian project.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:30Z\"}"}
