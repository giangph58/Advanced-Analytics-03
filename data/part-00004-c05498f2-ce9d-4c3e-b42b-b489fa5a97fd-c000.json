In this work, we present the experimental realization of\\nheralded storage using a Rydberg superatom, a mesoscopic atomic ensemble\\noperating in the strong blockade regime. In our approach, an input photon is\\ninitially stored in the superatom via electromagnetically induced transparency.\\nSubsequently, a second photon is emitted conditioned on the success of the\\nfirst photon's storage. Due to the collectively enhanced interaction, both the\\nstorage and the emission of the herald photon can be rather efficient in\\nprinciple. As a demonstration of this technique, we use it to entangle two\\nremote Rydberg superatoms. This method obviates the need for an intermediate\\nnode, which is commonly employed in traditional interference-based remote\\nentanglement schemes. Our results showcase the potential of performing\\ncavity-QED-like experiments with Rydberg superatoms. This work opens pathways\\nfor numerous applications in quantum networks and linear optical quantum\\ncomputing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:47:29Z\"}"}
