{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23950v1\", \"title\": \"Plasmons in N-layer systems\", \"summary\": \"In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique\\nplasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers\\ndue to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We\\ninvestigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of\\ninterlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for\\nmultilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szeg\\\\H{o}\\nToeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon\\ndispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer\\nsystems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase\\nacoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions\\n($\\\\omega_\\\\alpha\\\\propto q/\\\\sqrt{{1-\\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha-1}{N}\\\\pi\\\\right)}}}$\\nfor $\\\\alpha = 2, 3, \\\\cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon\\nmode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\\\\omega_1\\\\propto \\\\sqrt{q}$). When\\ninterlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps\\nthat are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode\\nremains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general\\ncoupled-layer structures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:02:44Z\"}"}
