Typical performance requirements concerning\\nthese type of suspensions are defined in terms of both H2- and Hinf-type\\nconstraints. A non-smooth optimization approach is investigated, which allows\\nthe use of non-convex cost functions that are often a result of mixed H2/Hinf\\noptimization problems. Besides the controller, the distribution of the\\nactuation is integrated with the optimization to investigate the feasibility of\\nsimultaneous controller and actuator optimization. The results demonstrate that\\nthe proposed non-smooth optimization method is able to find suitable solutions\\nfor the control and actuator distribution that satisfy all required performance\\nand design constraints.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:08:05Z\"}"}
