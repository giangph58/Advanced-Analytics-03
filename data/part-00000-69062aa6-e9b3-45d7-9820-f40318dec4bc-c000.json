The entire system is\\nsimulated within a tight-binding framework based on the Hubbard-Holstein model.\\nTransmission probability and spin polarization are evaluated using the Green's\\nfunction method under the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation through a\\nself-consistent procedure. The transmission profile is found to be consistent\\nwith the band structure, which is also discussed. An overall enhancement of\\nspin polarization induced by e-ph interaction is reported for the first time,\\nto the best of our knowledge. Our analysis may be useful for studying\\ncontrolled spin-selective electron transmission in the presence of e-ph\\ncoupling.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:05:28Z\"}"}
