Such systems can be solved\\nstraightforwardly if the Hamiltonian can be transformed into a time-independent\\nform. The condition under which a unitary transformation can be used to render\\ntime-dependent Hamiltonians into a time-independent form, thereby making the\\nsolution, is examined. After case-by-case analysis of different four and\\nfive-level systems, we conclude that systems having only one odd or even parity\\nlevel are solvable. In contrast, the others must satisfy a condition of laser\\ndetuning for solvability.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:55:07Z\"}"}
