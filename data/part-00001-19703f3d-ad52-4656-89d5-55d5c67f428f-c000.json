The main contribution\\nof this work is proving that this problem is $\\\\mathsf{P}$-complete, implying\\nthat computing a sequence of local complementation is unlikely to be\\nefficiently parallelizable. The proof is based on a reduction from the Circuit\\nValue Problem, a well-known $\\\\mathsf{P}$-complete problem, by simulating\\ncircuits through local complementations.\\n  Aditionally, the complexity of this problem is analyzed under different\\nrestrictions. In particular, it is shown that for complete and star graphs, the\\nproblem belongs to $\\\\mathsf{LOGSPACE}$. Finally, it is conjectured that the\\nproblem remains $\\\\mathsf{P}$-complete for the class of circle graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:27:46Z\"}"}
