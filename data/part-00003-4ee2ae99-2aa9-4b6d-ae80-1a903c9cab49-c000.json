In the hydrodynamic\\nregime, the viscosity tensor of such fluids has a nonvanishing odd component.\\nIn this scenario, fluctuating viscous stresses drive the propagation of\\nplasmons, whose dispersion relations are modified by nondissipative odd viscous\\nwaves. Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force\\nexerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag\\nforce can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron\\nliquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in\\nthe bilayer. As a result, the drag resistivity depends on the dissipationless\\nodd viscosity of the fluid. We quantify this effect and present a general\\ntheory of hydrodynamic fluctuations applicable to odd electron liquids, both\\nwith and without Galilean invariance.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:30:06Z\"}"}
