{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07500v1\", \"title\": \"Energy-Efficient UAV Replacement in Software-Defined UAV Networks\", \"summary\": \"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in networked environments face significant\\nchallenges due to energy constraints and limited battery life, which\\nnecessitate periodic replacements to maintain continuous operation. Efficiently\\nmanaging the handover of data flows during these replacements is crucial to\\navoid disruptions in communication and to optimize energy consumption. This\\npaper addresses the complex issue of energy-efficient UAV replacement in\\nsoftware-defined UAV network. We introduce a novel approach based on\\nestablishing a strict total ordering relation for UAVs and data flows, allowing\\nus to formulate the problem as an integer linear program. By utilizing the\\nGurobi solver, we obtain optimal handover schedules for the tested problem\\ninstances. Additionally, we propose a heuristic algorithm that significantly\\nreduces computational complexity while maintaining near-optimal performance.\\nThrough comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that our heuristic offers\\npractical and scalable solution, ensuring energy-efficient UAV replacement\\nwhile minimizing network disruptions. Our results suggest that the proposed\\napproach can enhance UAV battery life and improve overall network reliability\\nin real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:58:35Z\"}"}
