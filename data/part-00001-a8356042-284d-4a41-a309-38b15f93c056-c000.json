Our main result provides a sufficient condition on the algebra\\n$\\\\mathscr A$ under which ${\\\\mathrm BV}_{\\\\mathrm H}({\\\\mathrm X};\\\\mathscr A)$\\ncoincides with the standard metric BV space ${\\\\mathrm BV}_{\\\\mathrm H}({\\\\mathrm\\nX})$, which corresponds to taking as $\\\\mathscr A$ the collection of all locally\\nLipschitz functions. Our result applies to several cases of interest, for\\nexample to Euclidean spaces and Riemannian manifolds equipped with the algebra\\nof smooth functions, or to Banach and Wasserstein spaces equipped with the\\nalgebra of cylinder functions. Analogous results for metric Sobolev spaces\\n${\\\\mathrm H}^{1,p}$ of exponent $p\\\\in(1,\\\\infty)$ were previously obtained by\\nseveral different authors.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:32:47Z\"}"}
