{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21751v1\", \"title\": \"Reconstructing Humans with a Biomechanically Accurate Skeleton\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we introduce a method for reconstructing 3D humans from a\\nsingle image using a biomechanically accurate skeleton model. To achieve this,\\nwe train a transformer that takes an image as input and estimates the\\nparameters of the model. Due to the lack of training data for this task, we\\nbuild a pipeline to produce pseudo ground truth model parameters for single\\nimages and implement a training procedure that iteratively refines these pseudo\\nlabels. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our\\nmodel achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it\\nsignificantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and\\nviewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods\\nfrequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In\\ncontrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of\\nfreedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our\\napproach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks. We make the code,\\nmodels and data available at: https://isshikihugh.github.io/HSMR/\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:24Z\"}"}
