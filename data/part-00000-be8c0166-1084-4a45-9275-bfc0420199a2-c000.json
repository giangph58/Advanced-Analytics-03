{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07543v1\", \"title\": \"MUFFLER: Secure Tor Traffic Obfuscation with Dynamic Connection\\n  Shuffling and Splitting\", \"summary\": \"Tor, a widely utilized privacy network, enables anonymous communication but\\nis vulnerable to flow correlation attacks that deanonymize users by correlating\\ntraffic patterns from Tor's ingress and egress segments. Various defenses have\\nbeen developed to mitigate these attacks; however, they have two critical\\nlimitations: (i) significant network overhead during obfuscation and (ii) a\\nlack of dynamic obfuscation for egress segments, exposing traffic patterns to\\nadversaries. In response, we introduce MUFFLER, a novel connection-level\\ntraffic obfuscation system designed to secure Tor egress traffic. It\\ndynamically maps real connections to a distinct set of virtual connections\\nbetween the final Tor nodes and targeted services, either public or hidden.\\nThis approach creates egress traffic patterns fundamentally different from\\nthose at ingress segments without adding intentional padding bytes or timing\\ndelays. The mapping of real and virtual connections is adjusted in real-time\\nbased on ongoing network conditions, thwarting adversaries' efforts to detect\\negress traffic patterns. Extensive evaluations show that MUFFLER mitigates\\npowerful correlation attacks with a TPR of 1% at an FPR of 10^-2 while imposing\\nonly a 2.17% bandwidth overhead. Moreover, it achieves up to 27x lower latency\\noverhead than existing solutions and seamlessly integrates with the current Tor\\narchitecture.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:17:17Z\"}"}
