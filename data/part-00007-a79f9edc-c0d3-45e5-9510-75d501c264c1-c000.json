{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01901v1\", \"title\": \"Ross3D: Reconstructive Visual Instruction Tuning with 3D-Awareness\", \"summary\": \"The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and\\nvideos has spurred efforts to adapt these models for interpreting 3D scenes.\\nHowever, the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a\\nsignificant obstacle. To address this issue, typical approaches focus on\\ninjecting 3D awareness into 2D LMMs by designing 3D input-level scene\\nrepresentations. This work provides a new perspective. We introduce\\nreconstructive visual instruction tuning with 3D-awareness (Ross3D), which\\nintegrates 3D-aware visual supervision into the training procedure.\\nSpecifically, it incorporates cross-view and global-view reconstruction. The\\nformer requires reconstructing masked views by aggregating overlapping\\ninformation from other views. The latter aims to aggregate information from all\\navailable views to recover Bird's-Eye-View images, contributing to a\\ncomprehensive overview of the entire scene. Empirically, Ross3D achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance across various 3D scene understanding benchmarks.\\nMore importantly, our semi-supervised experiments demonstrate significant\\npotential in leveraging large amounts of unlabeled 3D vision-only data.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:59:55Z\"}"}
