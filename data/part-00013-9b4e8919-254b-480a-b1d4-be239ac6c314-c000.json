{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06729v1\", \"title\": \"Optimal Duration of Reserve Capacity Ancillary Services for Distributed\\n  Energy Resources\", \"summary\": \"The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into power\\nsystems presents opportunities and challenges for ancillary services (AS)\\nprovision. Technical requirements of existing AS (i.e., duration, reliability,\\nramp rate, and lead time) have been designed for traditional generating units,\\nmaking their provision by DER aggregates particularly challenging. This paper\\nproposes a method to design the duration of reserve capacity AS products\\nconsidering the operational constraints of DERs and the temporal dynamics of\\nsystem imbalances. The optimal product duration is determined by maximizing\\nproduct availability and aligning the supply profile with the system's\\nbalancing needs. We apply the methodology to a realistic Swiss low-voltage\\nnetwork with a diverse DER portfolio. The results reveal that (i) shorter\\nproduct durations maximize average availability and (ii) long product durations\\nimprove the alignment with system balancing needs. This paper offers valuable\\ninsights for system operators to design AS products tailored for DER\\nparticipation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:37:24Z\"}"}
