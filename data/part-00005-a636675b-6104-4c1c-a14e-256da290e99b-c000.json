This limits the ability of the\\ncommunity to benchmark and compare the performance of different solutions to\\none another in an effective manner, instead relying on largely holistic\\nevaluations. As part of the COMPARE Ecosystem project, we are developing\\nmodular grasping and manipulation pipeline infrastructure in order to\\nstreamline performance benchmarking. The infrastructure will be used towards\\nthe establishment of standards and guidelines for modularity and improved\\nopen-source development and benchmarking. This paper provides a high-level\\noverview of the architecture of the pipeline infrastructure, experiments\\nconducted to exercise it during development, and future work to expand its\\nmodularity.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:24:42Z\"}"}
