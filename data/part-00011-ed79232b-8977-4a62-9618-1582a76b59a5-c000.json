The ribosomal exit tunnels from different\\nspecies have elements of conservation and differentiation in structural and\\nphysico-chemical properties. In this study, by simulating the elongation and\\nescape processes of nascent proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnels of four\\ndifferent organisms, we show that the escape process has conserved mechanisms\\nacross the domains of life. Specifically, it is found that the escape process\\nof proteins follows the diffusion mechanism given by a simple diffusion model\\nand the median escape time positively correlates with the number of hydrophobic\\nresidues and the net charge of a protein for all the exit tunnels considered.\\nThese properties hold for twelve distinct proteins considered in two slightly\\ndifferent and improved G\\\\=o-like models. It is also found that the differences\\nin physico-chemical properties of the tunnels lead to quantitative differences\\nin the protein escape times. In particular, the relatively strong\\nhydrophobicity of the E. coli's tunnel and the unusually high number of\\nnegatively charged amino acids on the tunnel's surface of H. marismortui lead\\nto substantially slower escapes of proteins at these tunnels than at those of\\nS. cerevisisae and H. sapiens.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:40:58Z\"}"}
