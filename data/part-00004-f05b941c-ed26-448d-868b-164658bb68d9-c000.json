This technique is applied across domains such as healthcare, newswire,\\nand intelligence analysis, aiding models in these areas to perform temporal\\nreasoning and enabling human users to grasp the temporal structure of text.\\nTransformer-based pre-trained language models have produced revolutionary\\nadvancements in natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional\\nperformance across a multitude of tasks. Despite the achievements garnered by\\nTransformer-based approaches in temporal IE, there is a lack of comprehensive\\nreviews on these endeavors. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by\\nsystematically summarizing and analyzing the body of work on temporal IE using\\nTransformers while highlighting potential future research directions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T05:48:24Z\"}"}
