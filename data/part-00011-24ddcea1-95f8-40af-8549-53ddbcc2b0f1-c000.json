By applying the finite-dimensional reduction\\nmethod, we construct a periodic solution when the prescribed curvature function\\nis periodic. Furthermore, we also consider the Grushin critical problem in\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^{N} (N \\\\geq 5)$. Compared with Billel et al. (Differential Integral\\nEquations 32: 49-90, 2019), we use the method by Guo and Yan (Math. Ann. 388:\\n795-830, 2024) to construct periodic solutions under some weaker conditions,\\navoiding the complicated estimates and uniqueness proof. Notably, Guo and Yan\\n(Math. Ann. 388: 795-830, 2024) obtained solutions periodic with respect to\\nsome of the first variables, while the solutions in this paper are periodic\\nwith respect to some intermediate variables.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:29:32Z\"}"}
