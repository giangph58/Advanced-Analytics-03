{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23881v1\", \"title\": \"ExScene: Free-View 3D Scene Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting from\\n  a Single Image\", \"summary\": \"The increasing demand for augmented and virtual reality applications has\\nhighlighted the importance of crafting immersive 3D scenes from a simple\\nsingle-view image. However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view\\ninput, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D\\nscenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations\\nmake them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To\\naddress this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct\\nan immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel\\nmultimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent\\npanoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to\\ncalculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric\\ninformation with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian\\nSplatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique\\nwith 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and\\ncolor-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color\\nand spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are\\nthen used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction\\nquality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent\\nand immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly\\nsurpassing state-of-the-art baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:33:22Z\"}"}
