At\\nthe core of our approach is a multi-view consistency mechanism in UV space,\\nwhich ensures coherent textures across different viewpoints. Specifically,\\nMD-ProjTex fuses noise predictions from multiple views at each diffusion step\\nand jointly updates the per-view denoising directions to maintain 3D\\nconsistency. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on\\noptimization or sequential view synthesis, MD-ProjTex is computationally more\\nefficient and achieves better quantitative and qualitative results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:58:06Z\"}"}
