{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23681v1\", \"title\": \"Universality of Shell Effects in Fusion-Fission Mass Distributions\", \"summary\": \"We present the results of a broad, systematic study of heavy-ion induced\\nfission mass distributions for every even-Z compound nucleus ($Z_\\\\mathrm{CN}$)\\nfrom $^{144}$Gd to $^{212}$Th. We find systematic evidence of shell-driven\\nstructure in every fission mass distribution. The change in shape of the mass\\ndistributions with $Z_\\\\mathrm{CN}$ is consistent with the results of\\nquantitative simultaneous fitting in mass and total kinetic energy,\\ndemonstrating that fragment proton shell gaps at $Z_\\\\mathrm{FF} = 34, 36$ and\\n$Z_\\\\mathrm{FF} = 44, 46$ are \\\\textit{both} major drivers of fission mass\\ndistributions below the actinide region. The mass distributions show enhanced\\nyields at mass symmetry for values of $Z_\\\\mathrm{CN}$ equal to two times these\\nfavoured $Z_\\\\mathrm{FF}$ values. Thus, the same shell gaps that are drivers of\\nmass-asymmetric fission also affect mass distributions at and near\\nmass-symmetry. For all systems a second, more mass-asymmetric, fission mode is\\nrequired to fit the fission mass distributions. If driven by a single shell\\ngap, it appears to be in the light fragment around $Z_\\\\mathrm{FF} = 28, 30$.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:02:02Z\"}"}
