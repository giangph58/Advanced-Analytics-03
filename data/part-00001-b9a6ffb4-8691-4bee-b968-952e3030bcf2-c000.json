A major challenge threatening the\\nscalability of this platform is the limited qubit connectivity due to the\\nfinite range of interactions between atoms. We discuss an approach to realize\\ndynamical all-to-all connectivity between qubits with the use of moving atoms,\\nwhich we referred to as messenger qubits, that interact with the computational\\nqubits of the processor. We propose four specific architectures capitalizing on\\nthis idea and compare them one to another, as well as to alternative\\napproaches. We argue that the use of messenger qubits, while posing new\\ntechnological challenges, promises further development of the\\nRydberg-atom-based platform.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:57:24Z\"}"}
