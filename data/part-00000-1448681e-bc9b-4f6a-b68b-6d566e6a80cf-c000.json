However, we find that\\nonly U-spin symmetry cannot provide effective predictions, particularly for\\n$\\\\Lambda_b$ decays. For giving more useful predictions, we also give a simple\\ndynamic analysis. By counting the\\npower($\\\\lambda=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda_{QCD}}{m_b}}$) of each topological diagram,\\nwe find that for the specific decay $B_b^2\\\\to R(B_1^2 M^2 M^{\\\\bar 2})M^2$, only\\none U-spin amplitude can contribute in the leading power. Then the effective\\nprediction can be given as \\\\begin{align}\\n  A_{CP}^{dir}(\\\\Lambda_b^0 \\\\to R( p \\\\pi^- \\\\pi^+ )\\\\pi^-) = (-12.98 \\\\pm\\n2.85)\\\\%.\\\\notag \\\\end{align} Considering the $\\\\Lambda_b$ can effectively produced\\nin LHCb, we strongly encourage a more precise experimental investigation of it.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:05:00Z\"}"}
