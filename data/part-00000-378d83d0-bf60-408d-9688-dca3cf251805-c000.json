Formally this means\\nthat the variance of the parameter to be estimated decreases faster than\\n$N^{-1}$, where $N$ is the number of particles forming the quantum system. In\\npractice such scaling is challenging to achieve as the underlying many-body\\ncorrelations are fragile. Moreover, devising the optimal measurements that\\nindeed tap the quantum enhancement is often rather involved. Here we show that\\nthe inefficient detection of the photo emission from a dissipative quantum\\nmany-body system is sufficient to reach quantum enhanced parameter estimation\\neven when some loss channels remain completely unmonitored. We illustrate our\\napproach by considering the so-called boundary time-crystal, which is a\\nnonequilibrium many-body system that has been realized recently experimentally\\nin cold atomic gases. By analyzing the structure of the temporal correlations\\nof its emission field, we are able to construct a family of near optimal\\nparameter estimation measurements with a simple interferometric setup.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:56:57Z\"}"}
