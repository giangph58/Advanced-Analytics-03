{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02251v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Lipschitz Bandits\", \"summary\": \"The Lipschitz bandit is a key variant of stochastic bandit problems where the\\nexpected reward function satisfies a Lipschitz condition with respect to an arm\\nmetric space. With its wide-ranging practical applications, various Lipschitz\\nbandit algorithms have been developed, achieving the cumulative regret lower\\nbound of order $\\\\tilde O(T^{(d_z+1)/(d_z+2)})$ over time horizon $T$. Motivated\\nby recent advancements in quantum computing and the demonstrated success of\\nquantum Monte Carlo in simpler bandit settings, we introduce the first quantum\\nLipschitz bandit algorithms to address the challenges of continuous action\\nspaces and non-linear reward functions. Specifically, we first leverage the\\nelimination-based framework to propose an efficient quantum Lipschitz bandit\\nalgorithm named Q-LAE. Next, we present novel modifications to the classical\\nZooming algorithm, which results in a simple quantum Lipschitz bandit method,\\nQ-Zooming. Both algorithms exploit the computational power of quantum methods\\nto achieve an improved regret bound of $\\\\tilde O(T^{d_z/(d_z+1)})$.\\nComprehensive experiments further validate our improved theoretical findings,\\ndemonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing Lipschitz\\nbandit methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:39:04Z\"}"}
