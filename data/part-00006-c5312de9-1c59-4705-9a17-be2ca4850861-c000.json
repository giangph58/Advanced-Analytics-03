In particular, we show that the\\ncanonical embedding as a linear transform has a condition number bounded above\\nby a polynomial in $n$. In addition, we describe a fast multiplication\\nalgorithm in the ring of integers of these real subfields. The multiplication\\nalgorithm uses the fast Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and has computational\\ncomplexity $\\\\mathcal{O}(n \\\\log n)$. Both the proof of the RLWE-PLWE equivalence\\nand the fast multiplication algorithm are generalizations of previous results\\nby Ahola et al., where the same claims are proved for a single prime $p = 3$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,math.NT,E.3.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:01:48Z\"}"}
