The required modelling is\\nstraightforward in Newtonian gravity -- where the tide can be represented in\\nterms of a sum involving the star's oscillation modes -- but not yet fully\\ndeveloped in general relativity -- where the mode-sum approach is problematic.\\nAs a step towards more realistic models, we are motivated to explore the\\npost-Newtonian (pN) approach to the problem (noting that the modes should still\\nprovide an adequate basis for a tidal expansion up to 2pN order). Specifically,\\nin this paper we develop the pN framework for neutron star oscillations and\\nexplore to what extent the results remain robust for stars in the strong-field\\nregime. Our numerical results show that the model is accurate for low-mass\\nstars ($\\\\lesssim 0.8M_{\\\\odot}$), but becomes problematic for more massive\\nstars. However, we demonstrate that the main issues can be resolved (at the\\ncost of abandoning the consistency of the pN expansion) allowing us to extend\\nthe calculation into the neutron star regime. For canonical neutron stars\\n($\\\\approx 1.4M_\\\\odot$) our adjusted formulation provides the fundamental mode\\nof the star with an accuracy comparable to that of the relativistic Cowling\\napproximation. For lower mass stars, our approach is significantly better.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:24:16Z\"}"}
