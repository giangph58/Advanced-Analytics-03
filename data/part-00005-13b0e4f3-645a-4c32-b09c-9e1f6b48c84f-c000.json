This\\nsensitivity enables fine-tuning of the resonance wavelength and near-field\\nenhancement, offering the potential for advanced optical applications. However,\\nconventional lithographic techniques for gap modulation are constrained to\\ndiscrete values and face challenges in achieving nanometer order of\\nseparations. Such limitations hinder the comprehensive study of plasmon\\ncoupling across varying interaction regimes. Overcoming these challenges is\\nessential for advancing nanoplasmonic research and its practical applications.\\nHerein, we demonstrate a tuneable plasmonic device in which real-time\\ntunability of this hybridization mode is achieved via manipulation of the\\ninter-droplet gap of liquid metal nanoparticles by macroscopic physical\\ndeformation. In particular, we show that the optical spectra obtained from the\\nsample shift towards higher energy on the application of a linear strain,\\nresulting in an increase of inter-droplet gaps leading to a direct probing of\\nthe bright modes in situ. Our method thus offers a novel means of exploring the\\nfundamental concept of real-time tuneable plasmon hybridization as well as\\ntuning of nanoparticle assembly with any desired gap in a controlled manner.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:04:39Z\"}"}
