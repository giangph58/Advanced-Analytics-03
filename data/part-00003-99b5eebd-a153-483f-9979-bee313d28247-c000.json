In this paper,\\nwe introduce a novel methodology for material identification using a\\nhigh-dimensional dataset consisting of AFM phase approach-curves collected from\\nfive distinct materials: silicon, silicon dioxide, platinum, silver, and gold.\\nEach measurement comprises 50 phase values obtained at progressively increasing\\ntip-sample distances, resulting in 50x50x50 voxel images that represent phase\\nvariations at different depths. Using this dataset, we compare k-nearest\\nneighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and feedforward neural network (FNN)\\nmethods for material segmentation. Our results indicate that the FNN provides\\nthe highest accuracy and F1 score, outperforming more traditional approaches.\\nFinally, we demonstrate the practical value of these segmented maps by\\ngenerating virtual scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy\\n(s-SNOM) images, highlighting how AFM phase approach-curves can be leveraged to\\nproduce detailed, predictive tools for nanoscale optical analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:42:03Z\"}"}
