Our result reveals that when the characteristic\\nrelaxation time of the fluid is much smaller than the inverse critical field\\nfrequency, the particle's rotation behavior aligns with that in Newtonian\\nfluids. Increasing the relaxation time enhances the time-averaged rotation\\nfrequency of the particle that undergo asynchronous rotation. Moreover, the\\ncritical frequency is shown to scale linearly with the magnetic field intensity\\nand inversely with the fluid's zero-shear viscosity. Our work is expected to\\nguide precise manipulation of ferromagnetic particles in biomedical systems\\nwhere viscoelastic environments dominate.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:31:09Z\"}"}
