To this end, resources available at the individual nodes for sensing\\nor computing, or both, can be leveraged. This results in approaches known as\\nparticipatory sensing and federated learning, respectively. We investigate the\\nsimultaneous implementation of both, through a distributed approach based on\\nempowering local nodes with game theoretic decision making. A global objective\\nof energy minimization is combined with the individual node's optimization of\\nlocal expenditure for sensing and transmitting data over multiple learning\\nrounds. We present extensive evaluations of this technique, based on both a\\ntheoretical framework and experiments in a simulated network scenario with real\\ndata. Such a distributed approach can reach a desired level of accuracy for\\nfederated learning without a centralized supervision of the data collector.\\nHowever, depending on the weight attributed to the local costs of the single\\nnode, it may also result in a significantly high Price of Anarchy (from 1.28\\nonwards). Thus, we argue for the need of incentive mechanisms, possibly based\\non Age of Information of the single nodes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:35:38Z\"}"}
