This answers a question by\\nBeresnevich--Nesharim--Yang and extends the main result of [Geometric and\\nFunctional Analysis, 31 (1), 1-33, 2021] to the inhomogeneous set-up.\\n  We also show for any nondegenerate curve and nondegenerate analytic manifold\\nthat almost every point is not weighted inhomogeneous badly approximable for\\nany weight. This is achieved by duality and the quantitative nondivergence\\nestimates from homogeneous dynamics motivated by [Acta Math. 231 (2023), 1-30],\\ntogether with the methods from [arXiv:2307.10109].\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:38:28Z\"}"}
