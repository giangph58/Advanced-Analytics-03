Similar paradigm shifts have occurred\\nin the past with the introduction of search engines and Wikipedia, which\\nreplaced or supplemented traditional information sources such as libraries and\\nbooks. This study investigates the potential for LLMs to represent the next\\nshift in learning, focusing on their role in information discovery and\\nsynthesis compared to existing technologies, such as search engines. Using a\\nwithin-subjects, counterbalanced design, participants learned new topics using\\na search engine (Google) and an LLM (ChatGPT). Post-task follow-up interviews\\nexplored students' reflections, preferences, pain points, and overall\\nperceptions. We present analysis of their responses that show nuanced insights\\ninto when, why, and how students prefer LLMs over search engines, offering\\nimplications for educators, policymakers, and technology developers navigating\\nthe evolving educational landscape.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:21:09Z\"}"}
