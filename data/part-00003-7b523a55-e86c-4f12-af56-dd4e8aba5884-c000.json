In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in\\nadvancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches\\noften face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To\\naddress this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as\\nthe intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the\\ncorridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to\\ntraverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios,\\nwe develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation,\\narchitecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further\\nintegrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending\\nthe differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory\\nto be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving\\nboth safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset\\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7%\\nreduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs,\\nsignificantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving. Additionally,\\nincorporating the corridor contributes to higher success rates in closed-loop\\nevaluations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T07:10:40Z\"}"}
