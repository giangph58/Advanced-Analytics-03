{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02456v1\", \"title\": \"The Amenability Framework: Rethinking Causal Ordering Without Estimating\\n  Causal Effects\", \"summary\": \"Who should we prioritize for intervention when we cannot estimate\\nintervention effects? In many applied domains (e.g., advertising, customer\\nretention, and behavioral nudging) prioritization is guided by predictive\\nmodels that estimate outcome probabilities rather than causal effects. This\\npaper investigates when these predictions (scores) can effectively rank\\nindividuals by their intervention effects, particularly when direct effect\\nestimation is infeasible or unreliable. We propose a conceptual framework based\\non amenability: an individual's latent proclivity to be influenced by an\\nintervention. We then formalize conditions under which predictive scores serve\\nas effective proxies for amenability. These conditions justify using non-causal\\nscores for intervention prioritization, even when the scores do not directly\\nestimate effects. We further show that, under plausible assumptions, predictive\\nmodels can outperform causal effect estimators in ranking individuals by\\nintervention effects. Empirical evidence from an advertising context supports\\nour theoretical findings, demonstrating that predictive modeling can offer a\\nmore robust approach to targeting than effect estimation. Our framework\\nsuggests a shift in focus, from estimating effects to inferring who is\\namenable, as a practical and theoretically grounded strategy for prioritizing\\ninterventions in resource-constrained environments.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:20:48Z\"}"}
