Large sky area,\\ndeep-field, and short timescale are the priority of time-domain observations.\\nSiTian is an ambitious ground-based project processing all sky optical\\nmonitoring, aiming for sky-survey timescale of less than 1 day. It is developed\\nby the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an integrated network of dozens of\\n1-m-class telescopes deployed worldwide. The Mini-SiTian Telescope Array is\\ncarried out for demonstrations on optical design, group scheduling, and\\nsoftware pipeline developments, to overcome the high technical and financial\\ndifficulties of SiTian project. One array contains three 300 mm F/3 telescope,\\nwith FOV of 5 degrees over 400-1000 nm wavelength range. The Mini-SiTian\\nTelescope Array is now under commissioning in Xinglong Observatory, and a\\nperfect platform for technical research and educational purposes.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:36Z\"}"}
