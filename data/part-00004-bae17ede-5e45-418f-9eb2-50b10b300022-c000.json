{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01351v1\", \"title\": \"Demonstration of Plate Analysis, an algorithm for precise relative\\n  astrometry\", \"summary\": \"Astrometry plays a crucial role in understanding the structure, dynamics, and\\nevolution of celestial objects by providing precise measurements of their\\npositions and motions. We propose a new approach to wide-field, relative\\nastrometry, Plate Analysis. Plate Analysis is an innovative algorithm that\\nestimates stellar coordinates and corrects geometric distortion based on\\nprecise reference sources, without relying on dedicated calibration fields. It\\nis implemented as a probabilistic framework using Stochastic Variational\\nInference to efficiently optimize the numerous parameters involved in the\\nmodel.\\n  The methodology was tested through a simplified simulation designed after the\\nGalactic center survey of the JASMINE mission. This simulation, called the\\nJASMINE mini-mock survey, covered three years of observation with 100 satellite\\norbits, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating the performance of\\nPlate Analysis. Although the observation model incorporated more than 30,000\\nparameters, the parameters were efficiently optimized through Plate Analysis.\\nThe results showed that the estimated coordinates closely match the expected\\nstellar motions, with an average positional error of about $70\\\\,\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu\\nas}$. These findings validate the potential of Plate Analysis for precise\\nwide-field astrometric applications, offering significant insights into\\nimproving the accuracy of stellar dynamics measurements.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:51:21Z\"}"}
