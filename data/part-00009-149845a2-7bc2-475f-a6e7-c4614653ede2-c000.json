In this work, we explore the application of\\ngenerative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation,\\nwhere classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a\\nnovel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which\\nenables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such\\nas energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic\\ngenerative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our\\napproach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic\\ninterpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark\\nturbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and\\nstability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional\\ndiffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable\\nresults for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic\\ninterpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative\\nmodels in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving\\nfundamental conservation properties.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cs.AI,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:29:01Z\"}"}
