{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07012v1\", \"title\": \"Assessing dominance in survival functions: A test for right-censored\\n  data\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a new statistical test to assess the dominance of\\nsurvival functions in the presence of right-censored data. Traditional methods,\\nsuch as the log-rank test, are inadequate for determining whether one survival\\nfunction consistently dominates another, especially when survival curves cross.\\nThe proposed test is based on the supremum of the difference between\\nKaplan-Meier estimators and allows for distinguishing between dominance and\\ncrossing survival curves. The paper presents the test's asymptotic properties,\\nalong with simulations and applications to real datasets. The results\\ndemonstrate that the test has high sensitivity for detecting crossings and\\ndominance compared to conventional methods.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:30:39Z\"}"}
