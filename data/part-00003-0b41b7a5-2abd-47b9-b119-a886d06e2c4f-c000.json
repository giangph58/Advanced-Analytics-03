Here we present a fiber-coupled\\nnitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center magnetometer capable of detecting iron oxide\\nsuspension (MagTrace from Endomagnetics Ltd.) used in breast cancer surgeries.\\nDetection of an iron mass as low as 0.56~mg has been demonstrated, 100 times\\nless than that of a recommended dose at a maximum distance of 5.8~mm. Detection\\nof an iron concentration as low as 2.8 mg/ml has also been demonstrated, 20\\ntimes less than a recommended dose. The maximum working distance from the\\nsensor can be as large as 14.6~mm for higher concentrations. The sensor head\\nhas a maximum diameter of 10~mm which would allow it to be used for endoscopy,\\nlaparoscopy and interoperative surgery.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:17:43Z\"}"}
