{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06867v1\", \"title\": \"xApp Conflict Mitigation with Scheduler\", \"summary\": \"Open RAN (O-RAN) fosters multi-vendor interoperability and data-driven\\ncontrol but simultaneously introduces the challenge of managing pre-trained\\nxApps that can produce conflicting actions. Although O-RAN specifications\\nmandate offline training and validation to prevent untrained models,\\noperational conflicts remain likely under dynamic, context-dependent\\nconditions. This work proposes a scheduler-based conflict mitigation framework\\nto address these challenges without requiring training xApps together or\\nfurther xApp re-training. By examining an indirect conflict involving power and\\nresource block allocation xApps and employing an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)\\napproach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we illustrate that a\\nstraightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance relative to\\nindependently deployed xApps and conflicting cases. Notably, augmenting the\\nsystem with baseline xApps and allowing the scheduler to select from a broader\\npool yields the best results, underscoring the importance of adaptive\\nscheduling mechanisms. These findings highlight the context-dependent nature of\\nconflicts in automated network management, as two xApps may conflict under\\ncertain conditions but coexist under others. Consequently, the ability to\\ndynamically update and adapt the scheduler to accommodate diverse operational\\nintents is vital for future network deployments. By offering dynamic scheduling\\nwithout re-training xApps, this framework advances practical conflict\\nresolution solutions while supporting real-world scalability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:16:48Z\"}"}
