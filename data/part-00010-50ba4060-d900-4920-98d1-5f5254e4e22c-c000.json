{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02586v1\", \"title\": \"Deep learning for music generation. Four approaches and their\\n  comparative evaluation\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces four different artificial intelligence algorithms for\\nmusic generation and aims to compare these methods not only based on the\\naesthetic quality of the generated music but also on their suitability for\\nspecific applications. The first set of melodies is produced by a slightly\\nmodified visual transformer neural network that is used as a language model.\\nThe second set of melodies is generated by combining chat sonification with a\\nclassic transformer neural network (the same method of music generation is\\npresented in a previous research), the third set of melodies is generated by\\ncombining the Schillinger rhythm theory together with a classic transformer\\nneural network, and the fourth set of melodies is generated using GPT3\\ntransformer provided by OpenAI. A comparative analysis is performed on the\\nmelodies generated by these approaches and the results indicate that\\nsignificant differences can be observed between them and regarding the\\naesthetic value of them, GPT3 produced the most pleasing melodies, and the\\nnewly introduced Schillinger method proved to generate better sounding music\\nthan previous sonification methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.AI,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:51:07Z\"}"}
