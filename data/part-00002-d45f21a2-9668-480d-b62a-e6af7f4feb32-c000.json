The non-symmetrical structure of the\\ncorrelators led us to derive an ansatz for the decomposition of the\\ndifferentiated Schur polynomials to calculate all the pair correlators. This\\nopens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character\\nexpansion.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:45:52Z\"}"}
