{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23813v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluation of a Virtual Laboratory Platform in General Education on\\n  Quantum Information Science\", \"summary\": \"Quantum information science and technology has been revolutionizing our daily\\nlife, which attracts the curiosity of young generations from diverse\\nbackgrounds. While it is quite challenging to teach and learn quantum\\ninformation science for non-physics majors due to the abstract and counter\\nintuitive nature of quantum mechanics. To address such challenges, virtual\\nlaboratories have offered an effective solution. This paper presents the\\nresults of pedagogical research on the efficacy of a virtual laboratory\\nplatform in general education courses on quantum information science.\\nSpecifically, a virtual lab activity on the Bell test was developed using the\\ncommercially available platform QLab. This activity aims to help undergraduates\\nfrom diverse disciplines grasp the counterintuitive yet fundamental concept of\\nquantum entanglement, famously referred to by Albert Einstein as \\\"spooky action\\nat a distance.\\\" Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted over\\nthree academic years, demonstrating that the virtual laboratory enabled over 80\\n\\\\% of students to comprehend the complex concept and characteristics of quantum\\nentanglement. This study provides an effective solution for addressing the\\nchallenges of teaching quantum information science in undergraduate general\\neducation courses, particularly for students from both science and non-science\\nbackgrounds.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:47:24Z\"}"}
