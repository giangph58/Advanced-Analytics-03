{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02516v1\", \"title\": \"A Planning Framework for Stable Robust Multi-Contact Manipulation\", \"summary\": \"While modeling multi-contact manipulation as a quasi-static mechanical\\nprocess transitioning between different contact equilibria, we propose\\nformulating it as a planning and optimization problem, explicitly evaluating\\n(i) contact stability and (ii) robustness to sensor noise. Specifically, we\\nconduct a comprehensive study on multi-manipulator control strategies, focusing\\non dual-arm execution in a planar peg-in-hole task and extending it to the\\nMulti-Manipulator Multiple Peg-in-Hole (MMPiH) problem to explore increased\\ntask complexity. Our framework employs Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to\\nparameterize desired trajectories and Black-Box Optimization (BBO) with a\\ncomprehensive cost function incorporating friction cone constraints, squeeze\\nforces, and stability considerations. By integrating parallel scenario\\ntraining, we enhance the robustness of the learned policies. To evaluate the\\nfriction cone cost in experiments, we test the optimal trajectories computed\\nfor various contact surfaces, i.e., with different coefficients of friction.\\nThe stability cost is analytical explained and tested its necessity in\\nsimulation. The robustness performance is quantified through variations of hole\\npose and chamfer size in simulation and experiment. Results demonstrate that\\nour approach achieves consistently high success rates in both the single\\npeg-in-hole and multiple peg-in-hole tasks, confirming its effectiveness and\\ngeneralizability.
