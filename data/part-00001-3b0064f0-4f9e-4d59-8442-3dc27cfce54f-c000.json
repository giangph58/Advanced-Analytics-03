In the first case our results lead to quantum elliptical\\nspirals converging to elliptical orbits where stars and other celestial bodies\\ncan form as the corresponding WIMP/molecular clouds condense. The examples\\ninevitably involve elliptic integrals as was the case in our earlier work on\\nequatorial orbits of toy neutron stars (see Ref. [27]). Hence this is the\\nexample on which we focus in this work on quantisation. The main part of our\\nanalysis which leans heavily on Hamilton-Jacobi theory is applicable to any\\nKLMN integrable planar periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems. The most useful\\nresults on Weierstrass elliptic functions needed in these two works we have\\nsummarised with complete proofs in the appendix. This has been one of the most\\nenjoyable parts of this research understanding in more detail the genius of\\nWeierstrass and Jacobi. However we have to say that the beautiful simplicity of\\nthe Euler two-centre results herein transcend even this as far as we are\\nconcerned. At the end of the paper we see how the Burgers-Zeldovich fluid model\\nrelates to our set-up through Nelson's stochastic mechanics.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,astro-ph.GA,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:34:33Z\"}"}
