{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06942v1\", \"title\": \"Density Approximation of Affine Jump Diffusions via Closed-Form Moment\\n  Matching\", \"summary\": \"We develop a recursive approach for deriving closed-form solutions to both\\nconditional and unconditional moments of affine jump diffusions with\\nstate-independent jump intensities. Using these moment solutions, we construct\\nclosed-form density approximations (up to a normalization constant) via moment\\nmatching for both conditional and unconditional distributions. Our framework\\nenables important financial applications, including efficient option pricing\\nand exact simulation for affine jump diffusions. Numerical experiments\\ndemonstrate the method's superior computational efficiency compared to existing\\nsimulation techniques, while preserving numerical precision.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:50:18Z\"}"}
