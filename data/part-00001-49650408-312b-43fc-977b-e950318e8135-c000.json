By introducing\\na physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and\\nestablishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative\\nGaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic\\nsine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\\\\beta^2 = 2\\\\pi$. The\\ndeterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear\\nestimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. Moreover, the\\nprobabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian\\nmultiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time\\nlight cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\\\\beta^2 = 6\\\\pi$ as a\\ncritical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite\\nsurprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold\\nat $\\\\beta^2 =8\\\\pi$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP,math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:53:59Z\"}"}
