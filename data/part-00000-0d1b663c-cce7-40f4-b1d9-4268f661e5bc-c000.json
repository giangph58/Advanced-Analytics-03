Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum\\ndroplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For\\nstronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as\\ncorrelations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a\\ncrystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The\\nspontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional\\nquantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the\\ndipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational\\nmolecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization\\ntakes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote\\ntwo-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments\\nwithout limitations from three-body recombination.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:23:58Z\"}"}
