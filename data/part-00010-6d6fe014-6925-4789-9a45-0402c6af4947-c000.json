The framework dynamically collects data, fine-tunes tasks\\nwith minimal samples, and leverages Meta-Learning for rapid adaptation. LoRA\\noptimizes fine-tuning, while Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) enhances\\nknowledge retention. Experimental results demonstrate improved adaptability and\\nmemory stability, positioning this approach as a scalable step toward\\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:13:31Z\"}"}
