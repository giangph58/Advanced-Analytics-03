Velocity Potential Field (VPF) planners offer real-time\\nadaptability but struggle with complex constraints and local minima, leading to\\nsuboptimal performance in cluttered spaces. Traditional approaches rely on\\npre-planned trajectories, but frequent recomputation is computationally\\nexpensive. This study proposes a hybrid motion planning approach, integrating\\nan improved VPF with a Sampling-Based Motion Planner (SBMP). The SBMP ensures\\noptimal path generation, while VPF provides real-time adaptability to dynamic\\nobstacles. This combination enhances motion planning efficiency, stability, and\\ncomputational feasibility, addressing key challenges in uncertain environments\\nsuch as warehousing and surgical robotics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:46:41Z\"}"}
