{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06836v1\", \"title\": \"Determining Fetal Orientations From Blind Sweep Ultrasound Video\", \"summary\": \"Cognitive demands of fetal ultrasound examinations pose unique challenges\\namong clinicians. With the goal of providing an assistive tool, we developed an\\nautomated pipeline for predicting fetal orientation from ultrasound videos\\nacquired following a simple blind sweep protocol. Leveraging on a pre-trained\\nhead detection and segmentation model, this is achieved by first determining\\nthe fetal presentation (cephalic or breech) with a template matching approach,\\nfollowed by the fetal lie (facing left or right) by analyzing the spatial\\ndistribution of segmented brain anatomies. Evaluation on a dataset of\\nthird-trimester ultrasound scans demonstrated the promising accuracy of our\\npipeline. This work distinguishes itself by introducing automated fetal lie\\nprediction and by proposing an assistive paradigm that augments sonographer\\nexpertise rather than replacing it. Future research will focus on enhancing\\nacquisition efficiency, and exploring real-time clinical integration to improve\\nworkflow and support for obstetric clinicians.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:51:15Z\"}"}
