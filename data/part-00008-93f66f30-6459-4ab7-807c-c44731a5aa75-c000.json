{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01886v1\", \"title\": \"GMAI-VL-R1: Harnessing Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Medical\\n  Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in general medical AI have made significant strides, but\\nexisting models often lack the reasoning capabilities needed for complex\\nmedical decision-making. This paper presents GMAI-VL-R1, a multimodal medical\\nreasoning model enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve its\\nreasoning abilities. Through iterative training, GMAI-VL-R1 optimizes\\ndecision-making, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy and clinical\\nsupport. We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating\\nstep-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the\\nmodel's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training,\\nGMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question\\nanswering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised\\nfine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization. Our work establishes new\\nevaluation benchmarks and paves the way for future advancements in medical\\nreasoning models. Code, data, and model will be released at\\n\\\\href{https://github.com/uni-medical/GMAI-VL-R1}{this link}.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:43:16Z\"}"}
