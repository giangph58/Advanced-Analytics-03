{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02599v1\", \"title\": \"Technical Overview of Recent Developments in Small Modular Reactors in\\n  the United States\", \"summary\": \"Small modular reactors (SMRs) are a class of advanced nuclear fission\\nreactors characterized by their compact core size (typically <300 MWe) and\\npassive safety systems. Their modular design enables on-site assembly, making\\nthem suitable for deployment in locations inaccessible to conventional\\nlarge-scale reactors. With rising global energy demand, particularly driven by\\nthe growth of AI, SMRs have recently gained attention as a potential solution\\nfor powering data centers. This technical review aims to provide the public and\\nrelevant stakeholders with a foundational understanding of SMR technology. It\\nbegins with an overview of SMR concepts, historical context, and their current\\nrole in the U.S. energy mix. Detailed technical summaries of nine selected SMR\\ndesigns are then presented, covering core design, fuel systems, reactivity\\ncontrol, and safety features. The report also outlines key regulatory\\nframeworks, including 10 CFR Part 50, Part 52, and the technology-inclusive,\\nrisk-informed, and performance-based framework currently under development.\\nFinally, major U.S. programs and legislative efforts supporting SMR deployment\\nover the past decade are summarized.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:01:32Z\"}"}
