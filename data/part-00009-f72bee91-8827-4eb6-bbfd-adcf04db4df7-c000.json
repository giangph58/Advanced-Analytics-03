{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02261v1\", \"title\": \"WonderTurbo: Generating Interactive 3D World in 0.72 Seconds\", \"summary\": \"Interactive 3D generation is gaining momentum and capturing extensive\\nattention for its potential to create immersive virtual experiences. However, a\\ncritical challenge in current 3D generation technologies lies in achieving\\nreal-time interactivity. To address this issue, we introduce WonderTurbo, the\\nfirst real-time interactive 3D scene generation framework capable of generating\\nnovel perspectives of 3D scenes within 0.72 seconds. Specifically, WonderTurbo\\naccelerates both geometric and appearance modeling in 3D scene generation. In\\nterms of geometry, we propose StepSplat, an innovative method that constructs\\nefficient 3D geometric representations through dynamic updates, each taking\\nonly 0.26 seconds. Additionally, we design QuickDepth, a lightweight depth\\ncompletion module that provides consistent depth input for StepSplat, further\\nenhancing geometric accuracy. For appearance modeling, we develop FastPaint, a\\n2-steps diffusion model tailored for instant inpainting, which focuses on\\nmaintaining spatial appearance consistency. Experimental results demonstrate\\nthat WonderTurbo achieves a remarkable 15X speedup compared to baseline\\nmethods, while preserving excellent spatial consistency and delivering\\nhigh-quality output.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:10:47Z\"}"}
