We use the simple update of\\nprojected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge to simulate the\\nstates of random quantum circuits (RQCs), which center around recent quantum\\nadvantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art\\nsuperconducting processors, our PEPS simulation is exact for circuit depths\\nless than $D_\\\\mathrm{tr}$ = $\\\\beta\\\\log_2\\\\chi$, where $\\\\chi$ is the maximum bond\\ndimension and $2 \\\\lesssim \\\\beta \\\\lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit\\ngates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling\\nbehaviors of the state fidelity by performing large-scale simulations for $n\\n\\\\leq 10^{4}$ or $\\\\chi \\\\leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has\\ncomputational cost scaling polynomially with $n$ for circuit depth $D =O(\\\\log\\nn)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state (MPS) approaches if $n$\\nis large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking\\nquantum algorithms, with future potential for sampling applications using\\nadvanced contraction techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:47:48Z\"}"}
