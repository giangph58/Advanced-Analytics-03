This technology is carried out non-invasively by taking images\\nso as to avoid direct touch with the wound thereby reducing the possibility of\\ninfection. The images obtained using the RGB camera will be used for color\\nsegmentation which will measure the wound dimensions. However, the image data\\nis in the form of a raster, the distance will affect the pixel size. Therefore,\\nit is necessary to consider the distance of the camera measurement to the\\nobject. The time-of-flight (ToF) method with a lidar sensor is used to\\ncalculate the distance of the camera to the object. It is necessary to\\ncalculate the ratio of the distance to the number of pixels obtained so that\\nthe value is always consistent. This study analyzed the use of appropriate\\nratios and regression systems on a webcam and a lidar sensor for measuring\\nwound dimensions. The results of the study show that there is a regression\\nmodel with a second-order polynomial relationship for the distance and number\\nof pixels obtained consistently with an error value of less than 5% which shows\\nvery good results\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:42:20Z\"}"}
