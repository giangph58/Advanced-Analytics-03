First, we study agents'\\nbehavior in linear quadratic mean field games (LQMFGs) under heterogeneous\\nerroneous information of the initial mean field state (MF-S), and formulate the\\nrelationships between initial errors and systemic deviations. Next, by\\ncapturing the initial error affection on the private trajectory of an agent, we\\ngive a distributed error estimation method based on maximum likelihood\\nestimation (MLE), where each agent estimates information errors only based on\\ndiscrete observations on its private trajectory. Furthermore, we establish an\\nerror-based segmented state estimation method, design the initial error\\ntolerant distributed mean field control method (IET-DMFC), and demonstrate the\\nconsistent property of state estimation as observation frequency increases.\\nFinally, simulations are performed to verify the efficiency of the algorithm\\nand the consistent properties.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:21:17Z\"}"}
