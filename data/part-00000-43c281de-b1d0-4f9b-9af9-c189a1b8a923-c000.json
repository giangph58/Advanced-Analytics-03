Using an NLP-based\\ninductive topic modeling approach, we identify recurring themes that have\\nshaped the physics education literature, including content-based topics,\\nteaching methodologies, laboratory practices, curriculum development, and the\\ninfluence of Physics Education Research (PER). Our findings reveal both\\noverarching trends and distinct thematic preferences between the journals.\\nPhysics Education has historically emphasized curriculum structures, social\\naspects of education, and interdisciplinary connections, whereas The Physics\\nTeacher has focused more on pedagogical strategies, demonstrations, and\\npractical teaching tools. Over the past three decades, both journals have\\nincreasingly incorporated discussions on technology, computation, and\\nPER-driven instructional practices. By tracing these developments over five\\ndecades, this study provides a broader perspective on how physics education has\\nresponded to changing educational priorities, technological advancements, and\\nresearch developments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:38:34Z\"}"}
