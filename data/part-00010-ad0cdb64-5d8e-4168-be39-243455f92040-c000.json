{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01872v1\", \"title\": \"CoMatcher: Multi-View Collaborative Feature Matching\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a multi-view collaborative matching strategy for reliable\\ntrack construction in complex scenarios. We observe that the pairwise matching\\nparadigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation\\nwhen the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme\\nviewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty\\nin interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations,\\nas the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address\\nthis, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage\\ncomplementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene\\nunderstanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a\\nreliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise\\nframework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching\\ntasks. Extensive experiments on various complex scenarios demonstrate the\\nsuperiority of our method over the mainstream two-view matching paradigm.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:27:44Z\"}"}
