In response to this challenge, we introduce an End-to-End Neural\\nCoreference Resolution system tailored for large-scale applications. Our system\\nefficiently identifies and resolves coreference links in text, ensuring minimal\\ncomputational overhead without compromising on performance. By utilizing\\nadvanced neural network architectures, we incorporate various contextual\\nembeddings and attention mechanisms, which enhance the quality of predictions\\nfor coreference pairs. Furthermore, we apply optimization strategies to\\naccelerate processing speeds, making the system suitable for real-world\\ndeployment. Extensive evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate\\nthat our model achieves improved accuracy compared to existing approaches,\\nwhile effectively maintaining rapid inference times. Rigorous testing confirms\\nthe ability of our system to deliver precise coreference resolutions\\nefficiently, thereby establishing a benchmark for future advancements in this\\nfield.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:06:52Z\"}"}
