Existing methods often struggle to provide the nuanced complexity of\\nhuman movement, resulting in perceptual inconsistencies and motion artifacts.\\nTo tackle these issues, we introduce FlowMotion, a novel approach that\\nleverages Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for improved motion synthesis.\\nFlowMotion incorporates an innovative training objective that more accurately\\npredicts target motion, reducing the inherent jitter associated with CFM while\\nenhancing stability, realism, and computational efficiency in generating\\nanimations. This direct prediction approach enhances the perceptual quality of\\nanimations by reducing erratic motion and aligning the training more closely\\nwith the dynamic characteristics of human movement. Our experimental results\\ndemonstrate that FlowMotion achieves higher balance between motion smoothness\\nand generalization capability while maintaining the computational efficiency\\ninherent in flow matching compared to state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:55:21Z\"}"}
