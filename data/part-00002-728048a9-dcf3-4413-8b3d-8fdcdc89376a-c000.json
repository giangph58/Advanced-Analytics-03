However, using their strict definition makes\\ncomputation costly. As both 2D and 3D microscopy imaging datasets grow larger,\\nthere is an increased demand for efficient algorithms that can quantify\\nmultiple objects in large volumes. We propose a novel approach for extracting\\nsphericity and roundness based on the output of a local thickness algorithm.\\nFor sphericity, we simplify the surface area computation by modeling objects as\\nspheroids/ellipses of varying lengths and widths of mean local thickness. For\\nroundness, we avoid a complex corner curvature determination process by\\napproximating it with local thickness values on the contour/surface of the\\nobject. The resulting methods provide an accurate representation of the exact\\nmeasures while being significantly faster than their existing implementations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:40:50Z\"}"}
