However, for\\nbulk-optics systems, where size, cost, stability, and reliability are factors,\\nthis remains either impractical or highly challenging to implement. In this\\npaper we present a framework to engineer continuous-variable entanglement\\nproduced through nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion in\\n\\\\chi^(2) nonlinear photonic lattices in spatial and spectral degrees of freedom\\nthat can solve the scalability challenge. We show how spatio-spectral pump\\nshaping produce cluster states that are naturally distributable in quantum\\ncommunication networks and a resource for measurement-based quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:24:00Z\"}"}
