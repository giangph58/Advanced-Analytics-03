Although\\nvarious techniques have been developed to create robustness test suites,\\nrequirements-based testing for DNNs remains largely unexplored -- yet such\\ntests are recognized as an essential component of software validation of\\ncritical systems. In this work, we propose a requirements-based test suite\\ngeneration method that uses structured natural language requirements formulated\\nin a semantic feature space to create test suites by prompting text-conditional\\nlatent diffusion models with the requirement precondition and then using the\\nassociated postcondition to define a test oracle to judge outputs of the DNN\\nunder test. We investigate the approach using fine-tuned variants of\\npre-trained generative models. Our experiments on the MNIST, CelebA-HQ,\\nImageNet, and autonomous car driving datasets demonstrate that the generated\\ntest suites are realistic, diverse, consistent with preconditions, and capable\\nof revealing faults.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:24:49Z\"}"}
