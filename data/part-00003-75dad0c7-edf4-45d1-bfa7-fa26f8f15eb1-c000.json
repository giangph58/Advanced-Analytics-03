It provides information complementary to the\\nother established techniques: it extends the limited view of scanning probe\\nmicroscopies from nanometers to micrometers and measurement time down to tens\\nof milliseconds, enabling to visualize the changes during sample treatment,\\ne.g., annealing, deposition, and gas or light exposure. From the point of\\nstructural analysis, it allows the measurement of diffraction patterns from an\\narea of diameter below 200 nm and imaging of phase distribution on the surfaces\\neither through dark-filed imaging or LEEM-I(V) fingerprinting. The advanced\\nmodes provide local angle-resolved photoelectron spectra and surface potential\\ndistribution. In this review, we aim to describe the utilization of LEEM to\\nstudy self-assembled molecular structures on solid surfaces. We present the\\nLEEM instrumentation and analysis of measured data in a tutorial way to provide\\nthe necessary background knowledge to enter the field. In the second part, we\\nsummarize the knowledge obtained by LEEM for several selected systems, which\\npoints to the strength of LEEM in understanding the self-assembled molecular\\nsystems and its synergy with other surface science techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:51:52Z\"}"}
