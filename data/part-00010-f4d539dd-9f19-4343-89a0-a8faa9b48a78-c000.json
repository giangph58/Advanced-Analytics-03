Using the\\nclassification of cubic graphs of small degree, we restrict possible local\\nstructure of such a graph $G$. After that, we exhaustively enumerate possible\\nneighbourhoods of a maximal $3$-clique of $G$ and check them against a variety\\nof conditions, including the combinatorial ones, coming from $\\\\lambda=3$ and\\n$\\\\mu=2$, as well as the linear algebra ones, utilising the Euclidean\\nrepresentation of $G$. These conditions yield contradiction in all cases, and\\nhence, no $\\\\mathrm{srg}(85,14,3,2)$ exists.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:13:09Z\"}"}
