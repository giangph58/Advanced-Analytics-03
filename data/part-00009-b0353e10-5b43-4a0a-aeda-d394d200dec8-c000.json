{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05878v1\", \"title\": \"KAN-SAM: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Guided Segment Anything Model for\\n  RGB-T Salient Object Detection\", \"summary\": \"Existing RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) methods aim to\\nidentify visually significant objects by leveraging both RGB and thermal\\nmodalities to enable robust performance in complex scenarios, but they often\\nsuffer from limited generalization due to the constrained diversity of\\navailable datasets and the inefficiencies in constructing multi-modal\\nrepresentations. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning-based RGB-T\\nSOD method, named KAN-SAM, which reveals the potential of visual foundational\\nmodels for RGB-T SOD tasks. Specifically, we extend Segment Anything Model 2\\n(SAM2) for RGB-T SOD by introducing thermal features as guiding prompts through\\nefficient and accurate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) adapters, which\\neffectively enhance RGB representations and improve robustness. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce a mutually exclusive random masking strategy to reduce reliance on\\nRGB data and improve generalization. Experimental results on benchmarks\\ndemonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:07:02Z\"}"}
