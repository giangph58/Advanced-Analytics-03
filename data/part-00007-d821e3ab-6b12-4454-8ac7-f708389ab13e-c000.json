Beginning with a factorization of the density\\ndistribution function of the particles to two component vectors in\\nconfiguration space, we impose very simple conditions on them such as\\ntranslational invariance of space-time and the conservation of flux under a\\ngiven potential function. A real-valued path-integral is formulated as a Green\\nfunction for the real-valued Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation. (2) We then study a\\nquantum stochastic path dynamics in a manner compatible with the\\nSchr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation. The relation between them is like the Langevin\\ndynamics with the diffusion equation. Each quantum path describes a\\n\\\\textquotedblleft trajectory\\\\textquotedblright\\\\ in configuration space\\nrepresenting, for instance, a singly launched electron in the double-slit\\nexperiment that leaves a spot one by one at the measurement board, while\\naccumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern as predicted by the absolute\\nsquare of the Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger function. We start from the relationship between\\nthe Ito stochastic differential equation, the Feynman-Kac formula, and the\\nassociated parabolic partial differential equations, to one of which\\\\ the\\nSchr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger equation is transformed. The physical significance of the\\nquantum intrinsic stochasticity and the indirect correlation among the quantum\\npaths and so on are discussed. The self-referential nonlinear interrelationship\\nbetween the Schr\\\\\\\"{o}dinger functions (regarded as a whole) and the quantum\\npaths (as its parts) is identified as the ultimate mystery in quantum dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:38:05Z\"}"}
