{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23699v1\", \"title\": \"Vapor-mediated wetting and imbibition control on micropatterned surfaces\", \"summary\": \"Wetting of micropatterned surfaces is ubiquitous in nature and key to many\\ntechnological applications like spray cooling, inkjet printing, and\\nsemiconductor processing. Overcoming the intrinsic, chemistry- and\\ntopography-governed wetting behaviors often requires specific materials which\\nlimits applicability. Here, we show that spreading and wicking of water\\ndroplets on hydrophilic surface patterns can be controlled by the presence of\\nthe vapor of another liquid with lower surface tension. We show that delayed\\nwicking arises from Marangoni forces due to vapor condensation, competing with\\nthe capillary wicking force of the surface topography. Thereby, macroscopic\\ndroplets can be brought into an effective apparent wetting behavior, decoupled\\nfrom the surface topography, but coexisting with a wicking film, cloaking the\\npattern. We demonstrate how modulating the vapor concentration in space and\\ntime may guide droplets across patterns and even extract imbibed liquids,\\ndevising new strategies for coating, cleaning and drying of functional surface\\ndesigns.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:00:45Z\"}"}
