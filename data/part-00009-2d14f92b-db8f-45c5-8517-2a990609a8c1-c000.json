More precisely, a recursive use of bi-submersions, a tool\\ncoming from non-commutative geometry and invented by Androulidakis and\\nSkandalis, allows us to integrate any universal Lie $\\\\infty$-algebroid of a\\nsingular foliation to a Kan simplicial manifold, where all components are made\\nof non-connected manifolds which are all the same finite dimension that can be\\nchosen to be equal to the ranks of a given geometric resolution. Its\\n1-truncation is the Androulidakis-Skandalis holonomy groupoid.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:20:32Z\"}"}
