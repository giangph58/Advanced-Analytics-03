We also\\nconstruct a full cohomology complex for restricted Poisson algebras in\\ncharacteristic 2 that captures formal deformations and prove that it is\\nisomorphic to the cohomology complex of a suitable restricted Lie-Rinehart\\nalgebra, under certain assumptions. A number of examples are provided in order\\nto illustrate our constructions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:54:29Z\"}"}
