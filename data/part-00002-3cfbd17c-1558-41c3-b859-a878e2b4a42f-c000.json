{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07495v1\", \"title\": \"Bottleneck Identification in Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling via\\n  Constraint Relaxation\", \"summary\": \"In realistic production scenarios, Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS)\\ntools often require manual intervention by production planners, as the system\\nworks with incomplete information, resulting in suboptimal schedules. Often,\\nthe preferable solution is not found just because of the too-restrictive\\nconstraints specifying the optimization problem, representing bottlenecks in\\nthe schedule. To provide computer-assisted support for decision-making, we aim\\nto automatically identify bottlenecks in the given schedule while linking them\\nto the particular constraints to be relaxed. In this work, we address the\\nproblem of reducing the tardiness of a particular project in an obtained\\nschedule in the resource-constrained project scheduling problem by relaxing\\nconstraints related to identified bottlenecks. We develop two methods for this\\npurpose. The first method adapts existing approaches from the job shop\\nliterature and utilizes them for so-called untargeted relaxations. The second\\nmethod identifies potential improvements in relaxed versions of the problem and\\nproposes targeted relaxations. Surprisingly, the untargeted relaxations result\\nin improvements comparable to the targeted relaxations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:53:10Z\"}"}
