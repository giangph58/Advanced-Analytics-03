{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24070v1\", \"title\": \"HACTS: a Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System for Robot Learning\", \"summary\": \"Teleoperation is essential for autonomous robot learning, especially in\\nmanipulation tasks that require human demonstrations or corrections. However,\\nmost existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability\\nto synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing\\nreal-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS\\n(Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes\\nbilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and\\nteleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a\\nsteering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene\\nseamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning.\\nImplemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors,\\nHACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS\\nsignificantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement\\nlearning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and\\nfacilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and\\ninteractive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the\\ncapabilities of robot manipulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:28:13Z\"}"}
