At 600{\\\\deg}C, austenite nucleates additionally at low-angle\\nGBs, exhibiting a temperature dependance. Correlative transmission Kikuchi\\ndiffraction /atom probe tomography reveals a misorientation-dependent\\nsegregation. While GB segregation has been reported to assist austenite\\nnucleation in medium manganese steels (3-12 wt.% Mn), an understanding of the\\ntemperature and misorientation dependance is lacking, which is the aim of\\ncurrent work. Since artifacts of atom probe can cause a broadening of the\\nsegregation width, we combined experiments with results from density functional\\ntheory (DFT) calculations that reveal that the Mn segregation is not limited to\\nthe GB plane but confined to a region in the range of approximately 1 nm.\\nConsequently, GB segregation alters both the GB interface energy and the free\\nenergy per unit volume corresponding to the transformation. We estimate the\\nlocal driving force for austenite nucleation accounting for the segregation\\nwidth of ~ 1 nm. Based on classical nucleation theory, we clarify the effect of\\nGB segregation on the critical radius and activation energy barrier for\\nconfined austenite nucleation at the GB.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:22:43Z\"}"}
