In this\\narticle, we propose a new asymptotic-preserving scheme based on the Unified Gas\\nKinetic Scheme (UGKS) for this model in two-dimensional space. This finite\\nvolume kinetic scheme follows the same approach as in our previous article and\\nrelies on a moment closure, at the numerical scale, of the microscopic flux of\\nUGKS. The method is developed for both structured and unstructured meshes, and\\nseveral techniques are introduced to ensure accurate fluxes in the diffusion\\nlimit. A second-order extension is also proposed. Several test cases validate\\nthe different aspects of the scheme and demonstrate its efficiency in\\nmultiscale simulations. In particular, the results demonstrate that this method\\naccurately captures non-local thermal effects.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:46:14Z\"}"}
