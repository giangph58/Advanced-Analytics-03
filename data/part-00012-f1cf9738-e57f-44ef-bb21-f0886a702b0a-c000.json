The architecture integrates NIST standardized\\nalgorithms CRYSTALS Kyber for encryption and CRYSTALS Dilithium for digital\\nsignatures with an immutable blockchain ledger to provide an auditable,\\ndecentralized storage mechanism. The system is modular, comprising a Sender\\nmodule for secure encryption and signing, a central User Storage module for\\ndecryption, reencryption, and blockchain logging, and a Requestor module for\\nauthenticated data access. We include detailed pseudocode, analyze security\\nrisks, and offer performance insights to demonstrate the system's robustness,\\nscalability, and transparency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:51:14Z\"}"}
