{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07008v1\", \"title\": \"Latent Diffusion U-Net Representations Contain Positional Embeddings and\\n  Anomalies\", \"summary\": \"Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing\\nrealistic images, spurring interest in using their representations for various\\ndownstream tasks. To better understand the robustness of these representations,\\nwe analyze popular Stable Diffusion models using representational similarity\\nand norms. Our findings reveal three phenomena: (1) the presence of a learned\\npositional embedding in intermediate representations, (2) high-similarity\\ncorner artifacts, and (3) anomalous high-norm artifacts. These findings\\nunderscore the need to further investigate the properties of diffusion model\\nrepresentations before considering them for downstream tasks that require\\nrobust features.
