{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21688v1\", \"title\": \"Global isotopic analysis of rotational spectroscopic data for barium\\n  monofluoride, BaF\", \"summary\": \"New high-precision microwave spectroscopic measurements and analysis of\\nrotational energy level transitions in the ground vibronic state of the\\nopen-shell BaF molecule are reported with the purpose of contributing to\\nstudies of physics beyond the Standard Model. BaF is currently among the key\\ncandidate molecules being examined in the searches for a measurable electron\\nelectric dipole moment, eEDM, as well as the nuclear anapole moment. Employing\\nFourier-transform microwave spectroscopy, these new pure rotational transition\\nfrequencies for the 138Ba19F, 137Ba19F, 136Ba19F, 135Ba19F, and 134Ba19F\\nisotopologues are analyzed here in a combined global fit with previous\\nmicrowave data sets for 138Ba19F (v = 0 - 4), 137Ba19F, and 136Ba19F using the\\nprogram SPFIT. As a result, hyperfine parameters are significantly improved,\\nand we observe a distinctive structure in a Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB)\\nanalysis of the primary rotational constant. This can be understood using the\\nnuclear field shifts due to the known isotopic variation in the size of barium\\nnuclei and in combination with the smaller linear mass-dependent BOB terms.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:54:53Z\"}"}
