For any asymptotic structure (e.g. AF/ALF, ALE, compact), we\\nprove that infinitesimal Einstein deformations admit a closed 2-form that\\nmeasures the perturbation to this charge. In the ALF and compact cases, we\\nfurthermore prove that a curve of metrics in the moduli space passing through\\nthe background instanton is conformally K\\\\\\\"ahler to second perturbative order.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:12:31Z\"}"}
