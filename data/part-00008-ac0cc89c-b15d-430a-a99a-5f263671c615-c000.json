A critical challenge\\nin QC emulation is managing numerical errors from finite arithmetic precision,\\nespecially truncation errors in resource-efficient fixed-point arithmetic.\\nDespite its importance, systematic studies quantifying how truncation errors\\nimpact quantum algorithm accuracy are limited. In this paper, we propose a\\nrigorous quantitative framework analyzing truncation error propagation in\\nfixed-point QC emulation, focusing on Grover's quantum search algorithm. First,\\nwe introduce a simplified two-value amplitude representation of quantum states\\nduring Grover's iterations and prove its theoretical validity. Using this\\nrepresentation, we derive explicit mathematical expressions characterizing\\ntruncation error accumulation across quantum gate operations. We quantify the\\noverall emulation error by the $\\\\ell_2$ distance between ideal and emulated\\nprobability distributions, obtaining asymptotic bounds scaling as $O(2^{n-f})$,\\nwhere $n$ is the number of qubits and $f$ is fractional-bit precision.\\nExtensive numerical simulations and empirical experiments on a practical\\nfixed-point QC emulator confirm that observed errors precisely match our\\ntheoretical predictions. Finally, we provide a closed-form formula to determine\\nthe minimal fractional-bit precision required to achieve a specified error\\nthreshold, offering clear guidelines for emulator designers balancing accuracy\\nand resource utilization.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:33:36Z\"}"}
