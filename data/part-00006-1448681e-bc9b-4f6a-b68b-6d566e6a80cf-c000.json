In this work we present\\na twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids.\\nFirst, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a\\ngiven subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for\\nmodels and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We\\nintroduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the\\noptimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals.\\nSecond, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to\\nderive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in\\nwhich the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like\\norbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective spin-bath\\nHamiltonian description for the system. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff\\ntransformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been\\nutilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the active space\\nHamiltonian of molecular chromium bromide.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:11:59Z\"}"}
