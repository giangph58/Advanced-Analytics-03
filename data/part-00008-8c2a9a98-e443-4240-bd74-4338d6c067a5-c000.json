Based on a sequence of noisy\\ninput-state data, we state a set-membership representation for the unknown\\nsystem dynamics. Then, we derive a sum-of-squares (SOS) program that minimizes\\nan upper bound on the worst-case cost over all bilinear systems consistent with\\nthe data. As a crucial technical ingredient, the SOS program involves a\\nrational controller parameterization to improve feasibility and tractability.\\nWe prove that the resulting data-driven MPC scheme ensures closed-loop\\nstability and constraint satisfaction for the unknown bilinear system. We\\ndemonstrate the practicality of the proposed scheme in a numerical example.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:24:56Z\"}"}
