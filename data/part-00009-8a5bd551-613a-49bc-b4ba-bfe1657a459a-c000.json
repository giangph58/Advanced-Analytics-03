{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01779v1\", \"title\": \"The Vertical Metallicity Gradient of the Galactic Disk for Mono-Age\\n  Stellar Populations in LAMOST\", \"summary\": \"The vertical metallicity gradient of the Galactic disk offers valuable\\ninsights into the disk's formation and chemical evolution over time. We\\nutilized the LAMOST-LRS young stellar sample to investigate this gradient and\\nfound that it approaches zero as stellar effective temperature (or age)\\nincreases (or decreases) across various Galactocentric distances. To validate\\nthis result, we analyzed 295 open clusters younger than 3 Gyr and 976 classical\\ncepheids within the Galactic disk. The findings confirmed that, within a given\\nnarrow age range, the vertical metallicity gradient is effectively zero. This\\nrelationship between metallicity and age supports the ``upside-down'' disk\\nformation theory, as it indicates that the youngest and most metal-rich stars\\ndominate the midplane, while older and more metal-poor stars formed at larger\\nvertical heights and currently tend to be at these heights. Overall, our\\nresults align well with theoretical predictions, offering further insight into\\nthe chemical evolution and structural properties of the Milky Way.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:43:02Z\"}"}
