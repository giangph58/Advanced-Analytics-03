Analyzing histological images of melanoma by localizing and\\nclassifying tissues and cell nuclei is considered the gold standard method for\\ndiagnosis and treatment options for patients. While many computerized\\napproaches have been proposed for automatic analysis, most perform tissue-based\\nanalysis and nuclei (cell)-based analysis as separate tasks, which might be\\nsuboptimal.\\n  In this work, using the PUMA challenge dataset, we proposed a novel\\nmulti-stage deep learning approach by combining tissue and nuclei information\\nin a unified framework based on the auto-context concept to perform\\nsegmentation and classification in histological images of melanoma. Through\\npre-training and further post-processing, our approach achieved second and\\nfirst place rankings in the PUMA challenge, with average micro Dice tissue\\nscore and summed nuclei F1-score of 73.40% for Track 1 and 63.48% for Track 2,\\nrespectively.
