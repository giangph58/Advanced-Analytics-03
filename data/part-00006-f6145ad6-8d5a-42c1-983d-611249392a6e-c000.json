{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02320v1\", \"title\": \"$\\u03b2$-decay properties of some astrophysically important Sc-isotopes\", \"summary\": \"In the late progressive stages of heavy stars, electron capture and\\n$\\\\beta^\\\\pm$-decay are the governing processes. The weak rates are essential\\ninputs for modeling the stages of high-mass stars before supernova explosions.\\nAs per results obtained from previous simulations, weak rates of Scandium\\nisotopes contribute substantially in changing the lepton-to-baryon ratio\\n($Y_e$) of the nuclear matter in the core. In the present analysis, we report\\nimportant $\\\\beta^-$-decay properties of crucial Sc isotopes in an astrophysical\\nenvironment with mass numbers $49 \\\\leq A \\\\leq 54$. The investigation includes\\nGamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions, terrestrial half-lives, and stellar\\nrates of electron capture (EC) and $\\\\beta^-$-decay reactions. The calculations\\nare performed using the proton-neutron (pn) quasi-particle random phase\\napproximation (QRPA) model over a wide temperature range ($10^7$-$3 \\\\times\\n10^{10}$ K) and density range ($10^1 - 10^{11}$ g/cm$^3$). Additionally, we\\ncompare our calculated results with available experimental and theoretical\\ndata. A good agreement is observed between our calculated half-lives and\\nexperimentally measured values. Our weak $\\\\beta^-$-decay and EC rates are\\ncompared with those from the Independent-Particle Model (IPM) and Large-Scale\\nShell Model (LSSM). At high stellar temperatures and densities, our calculated\\n$\\\\beta^-$-decay rates are smaller than those from the other models.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:47:40Z\"}"}
