We introduce a\\nmethod, novel for this application, based on diffusion generative models for\\nblind system identification, enabling the estimation of unknown nonlinear\\neffects using black- and gray-box models. This study compares this method with\\na previously proposed adversarial approach, analyzing the performance of both\\nmethods under different parameterizations of the effect operator and varying\\nlengths of available effected recordings.Through experiments on guitar\\ndistortion effects, we show that the diffusion-based approach provides more\\nstable results and is less sensitive to data availability, while the\\nadversarial approach is superior at estimating more pronounced distortion\\neffects. Our findings contribute to the robust unsupervised blind estimation of\\naudio effects, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models for system\\nidentification in music technology.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:56:51Z\"}"}
