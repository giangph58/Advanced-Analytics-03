{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05698v1\", \"title\": \"Point-based Instance Completion with Scene Constraints\", \"summary\": \"Recent point-based object completion methods have demonstrated the ability to\\naccurately recover the missing geometry of partially observed objects. However,\\nthese approaches are not well-suited for completing objects within a scene, as\\nthey do not consider known scene constraints (e.g., other observed surfaces) in\\ntheir completions and further expect the partial input to be in a canonical\\ncoordinate system, which does not hold for objects within scenes. While\\ninstance scene completion methods have been proposed for completing objects\\nwithin a scene, they lag behind point-based object completion methods in terms\\nof object completion quality and still do not consider known scene constraints\\nduring completion. To overcome these limitations, we propose a point\\ncloud-based instance completion model that can robustly complete objects at\\narbitrary scales and pose in the scene. To enable reasoning at the scene level,\\nwe introduce a sparse set of scene constraints represented as point clouds and\\nintegrate them into our completion model via a cross-attention mechanism. To\\nevaluate the instance scene completion task on indoor scenes, we further build\\na new dataset called ScanWCF, which contains labeled partial scans as well as\\naligned ground truth scene completions that are watertight and collision-free.\\nThrough several experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves improved\\nfidelity to partial scans, higher completion quality, and greater plausibility\\nover existing state-of-the-art methods.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T05:41:49Z\"}"}
