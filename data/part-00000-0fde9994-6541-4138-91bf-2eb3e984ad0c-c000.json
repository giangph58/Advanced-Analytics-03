In addition, charm production in\\nheavy-ion collisions addresses flavor-dependent quark transport properties in\\nboth hot and cold nuclear matter, helping to clarify the roles of coalescence\\nand fragmentation in heavy-flavor hadron formation. This contribution\\nsummarizes recent measurements from the ALICE experiment on charm production as\\na function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at various\\nenergies, including the measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production yield\\nratios in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions. New results on ${\\\\rm D}^0$\\nproduction in pp collisions as a function of the transverse spherocity of the\\nevent, as well as of the transverse event-activity classifier $R_{\\\\rm T}$, are\\nalso presented.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:55:52Z\"}"}
