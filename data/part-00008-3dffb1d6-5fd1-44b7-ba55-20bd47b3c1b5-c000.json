We show that there exist non-trivial semiflows on\\n$X$, unless $X$ is a minimal finite space. Specifically, non-trivial semiflows\\nexist if and only if $X$ contains down beat points, and a non-trivial semiflow\\nis essentially a strong deformation retraction. As a consequence of this\\nresult, we provide a new and concise proof that the only flow that can be\\ndefined on $X$ is the trivial flow. Finally, we discuss the number of different\\nsemiflows that can be defined on $X$ in terms of down beat points and other\\nspecial points.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GN\", \"categories\": \"math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:19:16Z\"}"}
