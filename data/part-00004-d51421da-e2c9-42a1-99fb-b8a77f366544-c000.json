{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05750v1\", \"title\": \"Radiative Backpropagation with Non-Static Geometry\", \"summary\": \"One of the core working principles of Radiative Backpropagation (RB) is that\\ndifferential radiance is transported like normal radiance. This report shows\\nthat this is only true if scene geometry is static. We suggest that static\\ngeometry is an implicit assumption in the current theory, leading to biased\\ngradients in implementations based on detached sampling, and demonstrate this\\nwith simple examples. We derive the general derivatives for non-static\\ngeometry: the RB-based derivatives with detached sampling are obtained either\\nby an algorithm similar to attached path replay backpropagation or by a\\nconstruction that reparameterizes the rendering integral over surfaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:26:50Z\"}"}
