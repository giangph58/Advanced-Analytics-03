{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05998v1\", \"title\": \"Can gravity mediate the transmission of quantum information?\", \"summary\": \"We propose an experiment to test the non-classicality of the gravitational\\ninteraction. We consider two optomechanical systems that are perfectly\\nisolated, except for a weak gravitational coupling. If a suitable resonance\\ncondition is satisfied, an optical signal can be transmitted from one system to\\nthe other over a narrow frequency band, a phenomenon that we call\\ngravitationally induced transparency. In this framework, the challenging\\nproblem of testing the quantum nature of gravity is mapped to the easier task\\nof determining the non-classicality of the gravitationally-induced optical\\nchannel: If the optical channel is not entanglement-breaking, then gravity must\\nhave a quantum nature. This approach is applicable without making any\\nassumption on the, currently unknown, correct model of gravity in the quantum\\nregime. In the second part of this work, we model gravity as a quadratic\\nHamiltonian interaction (e.g. a weak Newtonian force), resulting in a Gaussian\\nthermal attenuator channel between the two systems. Depending on the strength\\nof thermal noise, the system presents a sharp transition from an\\nentanglement-breaking to a non-classical channel capable not only of\\nentanglement preservation but also of asymptotically perfect quantum\\ncommunication.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:03:58Z\"}"}
