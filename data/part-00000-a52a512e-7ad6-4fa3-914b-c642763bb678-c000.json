These are languages of Vector Addition Systems with States with the\\nacceptance condition defined by the set of accepting states such that each\\naccepted word has at most k accepting runs. We develop tools for proving that a\\ngiven language is not accepted by any k-ambiguous VASS. Using them we show a\\nfew negative results: lack of some closure properties of languages of\\nk-ambiguous VASS and undecidability of the k-ambiguity problem, namely the\\nquestion whether a given VASS language is a language of some k-ambiguous VASS.\\nFinally, we show that the regularity problem is decidable for k-ambiguous VASS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:41:56Z\"}"}
