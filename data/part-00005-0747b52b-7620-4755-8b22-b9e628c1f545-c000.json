{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06681v1\", \"title\": \"Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero\\ntemperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a\\ncompetition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson\\ndensity is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic\\napproach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported\\nby recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of\\nboson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across\\nthe entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling.\\nOur stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass\\nratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal\\nstability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment\\nwith a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was\\ninsufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale\\nwas short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show\\nthat even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become\\nintrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum\\nphase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We\\nthus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase\\ntransition in a mechanically stable configuration.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:39:14Z\"}"}
