A scaling law for\\nnon-affinity is derived, showing it scales quadratically with activity and\\ninversely with density. At high activity, the non-affine parameter diverges,\\nsignaling defect proliferation and melting to a hexatic phase. This softening\\nis marked by reduced shear modulus, solid order, and hexatic order. At a higher\\nactivity, the hexatic melts to a fluid. We propose locally tuned activity to\\ncontrol non-affinity, demonstrated through numerical simulations. Our\\npredictions are testable in active colloids performing persistent random\\nmotion.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:21:35Z\"}"}
