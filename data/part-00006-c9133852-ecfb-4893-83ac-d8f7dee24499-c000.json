Here, we offer\\na novel approach to disentangling the complex stellar populations within ocen\\nbased on phylogenetics methodologies from evolutionary biology. These include\\nthe Gaussian Mixture Model and Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithms applied\\nto a set of chemical abundances of ocen stellar members. Instead of using the\\nclassical approach in astronomy of grouping them into separate populations, we\\nfocused on how the stars are related to each other. In this way, we could\\nidentify stars that likely formed in globular clusters versus those originating\\nfrom prolonged in-situ star formation and how these stars interconnect. Our\\nanalysis supports the hypothesis that ocen might be a nuclear star cluster of a\\ngalaxy accreted by the Milky Way with a mass of about 10^9M_sun. Furthermore,\\nwe revealed the existence of a previously unidentified in-situ stellar\\npopulation with a distinct chemical pattern unlike any known population found\\nin the Milky Way to date. Our analysis of ocen is an example of the success of\\ncross-disciplinary research and shows the vast potential of applying\\nevolutionary biology tools to astronomical datasets, opening new avenues for\\nunderstanding the chemical evolution of complex stellar systems.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:18:38Z\"}"}
