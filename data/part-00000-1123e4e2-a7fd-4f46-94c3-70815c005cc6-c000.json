{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07071v1\", \"title\": \"ASASSN-14dx: A cataclysmic variable harbouring a massive pulsating white\\n  dwarf\", \"summary\": \"We present the results of our study of ASASSN-14dx, a previously known but\\npoorly characterised cataclysmic variable (CV). The source was observed as part\\nof an ongoing high-time-resolution photometric survey of CVs, which revealed\\nthat, in addition to the known 82.8min orbital period, it also exhibits other\\ntransient periods, the strongest of which around 4 and 14 min. Here, we report\\nour findings resulting from a multifaceted follow-up programme consisting of\\noptical spectroscopy, spectropolarimetry, imaging polarimetry, and multicolour\\nfast photometry. We find that the source displays complex optical variability,\\nwhich is best explained by the presence of a massive white dwarf exhibiting\\nnon-radial pulsations. An intermediate polar-like scenario involving a spinning\\nmagnetic white dwarf can be ruled out based on the detected changes in the\\nobserved periods. Based on our optical spectroscopy, we can constrain the mass\\nand effective temperature of the white dwarf to be ~1.1 Msol and 16 100 K,\\nrespectively. The overall intrinsic flux level of the source is unusually high,\\nsuggesting that there remains significant residual emission from the accretion\\ndisc and/or the white dwarf even ten years after the 2014 outburst. Finally, we\\ncannot detect any spectroscopic signatures from the donor star, making\\nASASSN-14dx a possible period bouncer system evolving towards a longer orbital\\nperiod.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:40:24Z\"}"}
