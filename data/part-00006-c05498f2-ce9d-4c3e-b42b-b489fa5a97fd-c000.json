Fermionic chains with\\nextended nearest neighbor couplings have been observed to show unique\\ntopological transition at the multicritical points between distinct gapless\\nphases. In this work, we show that such topological gapless phases and the\\ntransition between them can be simulated in a quantum walk. We consider a\\nthree-step discrete-time quantum walk and identify various critical or gapless\\nphases and multicriticalities from the topological phase diagram along with\\ntheir distinguished energy dispersions. We reconstruct the scaling theory based\\non the curvature function to study transition between gapless phases in the\\nquantum walk. We show the interesting features observed in fermionic chains,\\nsuch as diverging, sign flipping and swapping properties of curvature function,\\ncan be simulated in the quantum walk. Moreover, the renormalization group flow\\nand Wannier state correlation functions also identify transition at the\\nmulticritical points between gapless phases. We observe the scaling law and\\noverlapping of critical and fixed point properties at the multicritical points\\nof the fermionic chains can also be observed in the quantum walk. Furthermore,\\nwe categorize the topological transitions at various multicritical points using\\nthe group velocity of the energy eigenstates. Finally, the topological\\ncharacters of various gapless phases are captured using winding number which\\nallows one to distinguish various gapless phases and also show the transitions\\nat the multicritical points.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.other,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:48:12Z\"}"}
