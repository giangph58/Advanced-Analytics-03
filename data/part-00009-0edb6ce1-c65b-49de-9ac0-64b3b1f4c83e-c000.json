The method uncovers the most effective instability\\nmitigation actions for both device-level and system-level investigations. The\\nparticular structure of the admittance and nodal models is exploited in the\\ndetailed derivation of the passivity sensitivity expressions. These proposed\\nsensitivities are validated for different parameters at device-level and at\\nsystem-level. Compared to previous stability and sensitivity methods, it does\\nnot require detailed system information, such as exact system eigenvalues,\\nwhile it provides valuable information for a less conservative stable system\\ndesign. In addition, we demonstrate how to utilize the proposed method through\\ncase studies with different converter controls and system-wide insights showing\\nits general applicability.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:23:23Z\"}"}
