We investigate how a\\nprivileged (\\\"smart\\\") species optimises its population by adopting advantageous\\nstrategies in one such model. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm, which\\nsuccessfully identifies optimal strategies based on a survival-of-the-weakest\\neffect, including directional incentives to avoid predators. We also\\ncharacterise the steady-state behaviour of the system in the presence of the\\nsmart species and compare with the symmetric case where all species are\\nequivalent.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:22:25Z\"}"}
