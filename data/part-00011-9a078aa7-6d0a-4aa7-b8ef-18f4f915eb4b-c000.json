{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01815v1\", \"title\": \"Multiplexed Control at Scale for Electrode Arrays in Trapped-Ion Quantum\\n  Processors\", \"summary\": \"The scaling up of trapped-ion quantum processors based on the quantum\\ncharge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is difficult owing to the extensive\\nelectronics and high-density wiring required to control numerous trap\\nelectrodes. In conventional QCCD architectures, each trap electrode is\\ncontrolled via a dedicated digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The conventional\\napproach places an overwhelming demand on electronic resources and wiring\\ncomplexity. This is because the number of trap electrodes typically exceeds the\\nnumber of trapped-ion qubits. This study proposes a method that leverages a\\nhigh-speed DAC to generate time-division multiplexed signals to control a\\nlarge-scale QCCD trapped-ion quantum processor. The proposed method replaces\\nconventional DACs with a single high-speed DAC that generates the complete\\nvoltage waveforms required to control the trap electrodes, thereby\\nsignificantly reducing the wiring complexity and overall resource requirements.\\nBased on realistic parameters and commercially available electronics, our\\nanalysis demonstrates that a QCCD trapped-ion quantum computer with 10,000 trap\\nelectrodes can be controlled using only 13 field-programmable gate arrays and\\n104 high-speed DACs. This is in stark contrast to the 10,000 dedicated DACs\\nrequired by conventional control methods. Consequently, employing this\\napproach, we developed a proof-of-concept electronic system and evaluated its\\nanalog output performance.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:21:31Z\"}"}
