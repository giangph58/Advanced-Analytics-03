{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23912v1\", \"title\": \"Certified Approximate Reachability (CARe): Formal Error Bounds on Deep\\n  Learning of Reachable Sets\", \"summary\": \"Recent approaches to leveraging deep learning for computing reachable sets of\\ncontinuous-time dynamical systems have gained popularity over traditional\\nlevel-set methods, as they overcome the curse of dimensionality. However, as\\nwith level-set methods, considerable care needs to be taken in limiting\\napproximation errors, particularly since no guarantees are provided during\\ntraining on the accuracy of the learned reachable set. To address this\\nlimitation, we introduce an epsilon-approximate Hamilton-Jacobi Partial\\nDifferential Equation (HJ-PDE), which establishes a relationship between\\ntraining loss and accuracy of the true reachable set. To formally certify this\\napproximation, we leverage Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to\\nbound the residual error of the HJ-based loss function across the domain of\\ninterest. Leveraging Counter Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), we\\nclose the loop around learning and verification, by fine-tuning the neural\\nnetwork on counterexamples found by the SMT solver, thus improving the accuracy\\nof the learned reachable set. To the best of our knowledge, Certified\\nApproximate Reachability (CARe) is the first approach to provide soundness\\nguarantees on learned reachable sets of continuous dynamical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:02:57Z\"}"}
