{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23752v1\", \"title\": \"StrokeFusion: Vector Sketch Generation via Joint Stroke-UDF Encoding and\\n  Latent Sequence Diffusion\", \"summary\": \"In the field of sketch generation, raster-format trained models often produce\\nnon-stroke artifacts, while vector-format trained models typically lack a\\nholistic understanding of sketches, leading to compromised recognizability.\\nMoreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar\\nelements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across\\nsketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage\\nframework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature\\nlearning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This\\nnetwork decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke\\nsequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as\\nsets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our\\nframework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously\\nadjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables\\nhigh-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing.\\nExtensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework\\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in\\npreserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be\\nmade publicly available upon publication.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:03:03Z\"}"}
