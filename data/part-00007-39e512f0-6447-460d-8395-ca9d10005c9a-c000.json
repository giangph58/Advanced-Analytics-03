These infinite\\nsequences, measures the diversity of subwords in Fibonacci words, showing\\nnon-decreasing growth for infinite sequences. Extends factor analysis to\\narithmetic progressions of symbols, highlighting generalized pattern\\ndistributions. Recent results link Sturmian sequences (including Fibonacci\\nwords) to unbounded binomial complexity and gap inequivalence, with\\nimplications for formal language theory and automata. This work underscores the\\ninterplay between substitution rules, algebraic number theory, and\\ncombinatorial complexity in infinite words, providing tools for applications in\\nfractal geometry and theoretical computer science.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:56:16Z\"}"}
