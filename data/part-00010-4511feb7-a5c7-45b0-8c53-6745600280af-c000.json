Ptychography is an imaging method where the complex\\namplitude of an object is estimated from a sequence of diffraction\\nmeasurements. We formulate this reconstruction as a Bayesian inverse problem\\nand derive an inference algorithm, termed \\\"Ptycho-EP,\\\" based on belief\\npropagation and Vector Approximate Message Passing from information theory.\\nPrior knowledge about the unknown object can be integrated into the\\nprobabilistic model, and the Bayesian framework inherently provides uncertainty\\nquantification of the reconstruction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,\\nwhen the probe's illumination function is known, our algorithm accurately\\nretrieves the object image at a sampling ratio approaching the information\\ntheoretic limit. In scenarios where the illumination function is unknown, both\\nthe object and the probe can be jointly reconstructed via an\\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our\\nalgorithm against conventional methods, highlighting its superior convergence\\nspeed.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:27:32Z\"}"}
