{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23971v1\", \"title\": \"Distortion of the CMB spectrum by the first molecules of the Dark Ages\", \"summary\": \"The formation of first stars and galaxies at the Cosmic Dawn had been\\npreceded by the chain of primordial chemistry reactions during Dark Ages which\\ngenerated first molecules, mostly H$_2$, HD, and HeH$^+$, so crucial for first\\nstars to emerge. These molecules absorbed and scattered CMB quanta this way\\ndistorting CMB spectrum. Estimate how much bound-bound transitions between the\\nrovibrational levels of H$_2$, HD, and HeH$^+$ molecules contribute to the\\ndistortion of CMB spectrum in the standard $\\\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We describe\\nthe kinetics of the formation of the first molecules with system of 166\\nchemical reactions involving 20 reagents. The system of differential equations\\nis solved to describe the processes of spontaneous and collisional transitions\\nbetween rovibrational levels of H$_2$, HD, and HeH$^+$ molecules. The\\npopulations of rovibrational levels and optical thickness of the gas in\\ntransition lines between these levels were used to estimate the differential\\nbrightness produced by the first molecules on the cosmic microwave background.\\nIt is shown that the signal from the first molecules in the standard\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM cosmology takes the form of an absorption profile in the CMB\\nspectrum and originates from the Dark Ages. H$_2$ shows multiple peaks, peaking\\nat $\\\\sim 10^{-3}$ Jy/sr between 50-120 GHz, with absorption from $300>z>200$.\\nHD has double peaks, reaching $\\\\sim 10^{-5}$ Jy/sr between 40-70 GHz, with\\nabsorption from $300>z>30$. HeH$^+$ has no features, peaks at $\\\\sim 10^{-7}$\\nJy/sr between 200-800 GHz, and absorbs mainly from $100>z>4$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:34:54Z\"}"}
