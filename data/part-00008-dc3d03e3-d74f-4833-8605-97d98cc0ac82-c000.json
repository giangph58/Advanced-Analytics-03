{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01914v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum-amplified global-phase spectroscopy on an optical clock\\n  transition\", \"summary\": \"Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology,\\noperating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing\\nquantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there\\nremain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution\\nrequirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a\\nnovel Rabi-type \\\"global-phase spectroscopy\\\" (GPS) that utilizes the\\ndetuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are\\nable to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that\\nachieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and\\n4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further\\nintroduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in\\nlight-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential\\nmeasurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our\\ntechnique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the\\nglobal nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to\\ntypical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to\\nnext-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the\\nfundamental quantum precision limits.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:18:18Z\"}"}
