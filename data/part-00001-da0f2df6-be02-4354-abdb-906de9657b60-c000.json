{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01818v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Constant-Space Multi-Vector Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"Multi-vector retrieval methods, exemplified by the ColBERT architecture, have\\nshown substantial promise for retrieval by providing strong trade-offs in terms\\nof retrieval latency and effectiveness. However, they come at a high cost in\\nterms of storage since a (potentially compressed) vector needs to be stored for\\nevery token in the input collection. To overcome this issue, we propose\\nencoding documents to a fixed number of vectors, which are no longer\\nnecessarily tied to the input tokens. Beyond reducing the storage costs, our\\napproach has the advantage that document representations become of a fixed size\\non disk, allowing for better OS paging management. Through experiments using\\nthe MSMARCO passage corpus and BEIR with the ColBERT-v2 architecture, a\\nrepresentative multi-vector ranking model architecture, we find that passages\\ncan be effectively encoded into a fixed number of vectors while retaining most\\nof the original effectiveness.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR,cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:22:23Z\"}"}
