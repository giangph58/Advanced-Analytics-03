The Rhodes-Wolhfarth\\nratio is found to be 13.29, while the coefficient of electronic heat capacity\\n($\\\\Gamma$) is 27 mJ-mol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ for Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC. Our x-ray\\nmagnetic circular dichorism measurement confirms that the magnetic moment\\narises from the Fe atom only, and Cr has negligible contribution towards the\\nordered moment. Our critical analysis indicates that the magnetic phase\\ntransition in Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC follows mean field theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:15:51Z\"}"}
