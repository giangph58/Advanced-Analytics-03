{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01936v1\", \"title\": \"Fermionic Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling\", \"summary\": \"Fermionic averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (FACES) is a protocol to\\nsimultaneously learn the averaged error rates of many fermionic linear optical\\n(FLO) gates simultaneously and self-consistently from a suitable collection of\\nFLO circuits. It is highly flexible, allowing for the in situ characterization\\nof FLO-averaged gate-dependent noise under natural assumptions on a family of\\ncontinuously parameterized one- and two-qubit gates. We rigorously show that\\nour protocol has an efficient sampling complexity, owing in-part to useful\\nproperties of the Kravchuk transformations that feature in our analysis. We\\nsupport our conclusions with numerical results. As FLO circuits become\\nuniversal with access to certain resource states, we expect our results to\\ninform noise characterization and error mitigation techniques on universal\\nquantum computing architectures which naturally admit a fermionic description.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:46:16Z\"}"}
