{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23927v1\", \"title\": \"Detecting Localized Density Anomalies in Multivariate Data via Coin-Flip\\n  Statistics\", \"summary\": \"Detecting localized density differences in multivariate data is a crucial\\ntask in computational science. Such anomalies can indicate a critical system\\nfailure, lead to a groundbreaking scientific discovery, or reveal unexpected\\nchanges in data distribution. We introduce EagleEye, an anomaly detection\\nmethod to compare two multivariate datasets with the aim of identifying local\\ndensity anomalies, namely over- or under-densities affecting only localised\\nregions of the feature space. Anomalies are detected by modelling, for each\\npoint, the ordered sequence of its neighbours' membership label as a\\ncoin-flipping process and monitoring deviations from the expected behaviour of\\nsuch process. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to provide an\\naccurate, entirely unsupervised estimate of the local signal purity. We\\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and\\nreal-world datasets. In synthetic data, EagleEye accurately detects anomalies\\nin multiple dimensions even when they affect a tiny fraction of the data. When\\napplied to a challenging resonant anomaly detection benchmark task in simulated\\nLarge Hadron Collider data, EagleEye successfully identifies particle decay\\nevents present in just 0.3% of the dataset. In global temperature data,\\nEagleEye uncovers previously unidentified, geographically localised changes in\\ntemperature fields that occurred in the most recent years. Thanks to its key\\nadvantages of conceptual simplicity, computational efficiency, trivial\\nparallelisation, and scalability, EagleEye is widely applicable across many\\nfields.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:20:04Z\"}"}
