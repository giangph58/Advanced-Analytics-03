{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711v1\", \"title\": \"Automated Archival Descriptions with Federated Intelligence of LLMs\", \"summary\": \"Enforcing archival standards requires specialized expertise, and manually\\ncreating metadata descriptions for archival materials is a tedious and\\nerror-prone task. This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and\\nlarge language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a\\nstandardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic\\nAI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions\\nof archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites\\nthe intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We\\nalso suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for\\nconsistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness\\nof our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world\\ndataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and\\ndata formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our\\ntechniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization\\napproach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and\\nreliability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.DL,cs.IR,cs.LG,I.2\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:11:05Z\"}"}
