{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06086v1\", \"title\": \"Investigating an Erupting Metric-decimetric Radio Depression and its\\n  Physical Origin\", \"summary\": \"We present direct metric-decimetric radio imaging observations of a\\nfascinating quiescent filament eruption on 2024 March 17 using data from the\\nDAocheng Radio Telescope (DART), with a combination of the Solar Dynamics\\nObservatory and the Chinese Ha Solar Explorer. At the radio band, even though\\nthe filament is difficult to identify in its early phase, it rapidly became\\ndistinct and formed a continuous loop-like dark structure during the eruption,\\ni.e., so-called radio depression. Compared with the fragmentation of the\\nerupting filament observed at the Ha and EUV bands, the radio depression\\nappeared more coherently. Based on synthetic radio images from a\\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a flux-rope-filament\\neruption, it is suggested that the radio depression originates from the\\nabsorption of cold and dense materials within the erupting flux rope to the\\nbackground emission. The absorption seems to be stronger than that at the Ha\\nand EUV bands, thus leading to their apparent discrepancies. Moreover, the\\nradio depression is also found to occupy the lower part but not the whole body\\nof the flux rope.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:27:36Z\"}"}
