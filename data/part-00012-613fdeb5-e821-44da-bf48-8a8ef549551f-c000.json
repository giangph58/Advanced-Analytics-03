{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06626v1\", \"title\": \"Localization of deformation in the central hub of hub-and-spoke kirigami\", \"summary\": \"A recent approach to the design of flexible electronic devices consists of\\ncutting a two-dimensional sheet to form a central hub connected to several\\ntapered `spokes', resembling the hub-and-spoke of a bicycle wheel. When\\nradially compressed, the resulting cut sheet buckles out-of-plane forming a\\nstructure whose three-dimensional shape can be chosen by designing the tapering\\nof the spokes. While the deformation of the spokes in this `hub-and-spoke'\\nkirigami are approximately cylindrical (i.e.~zero Gaussian curvature and hence\\nsmall elastic strain), this is not the case in the central hub. The central hub\\nis deformed radially because of continuity with the spokes but, because of its\\nown circular symmetry, it must develop Gaussian curvature, and hence strain. In\\nthis article we quantify this strain, focussing in particular on its magnitude\\nand its location. We find that the strain is localized in a boundary layer near\\nthe edge of the hub region, whose size is controlled by the moment applied on\\nit by the deformed spokes. We discuss the implications of our results for\\navoiding material failure in flexible-electronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:00:28Z\"}"}
