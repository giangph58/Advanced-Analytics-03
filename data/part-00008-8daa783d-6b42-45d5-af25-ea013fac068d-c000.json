{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205v1\", \"title\": \"The H\\u00f6rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function\", \"summary\": \"We characterize the function $\\\\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all\\nfunctions $f$ of exponential type at most $\\\\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This\\nfunction, studied by H\\\\\\\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real\\nzeros $\\\\pm \\\\tau_n$, $n=1,2, \\\\ldots$. Starting from the fact that\\n$n+\\\\frac12-\\\\tau_n$ is an $\\\\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of\\nours, we identify $\\\\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\\\\varphi(z)$ as\\n$\\\\Phi(z)\\\\Phi(-z)$, where $\\\\Phi(z)=\\n\\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty(1+(-1)^n\\\\frac{z}{\\\\tau_n})$ and show that $\\\\Phi$ satisfies a\\ncertain second order linear differential equation along with a functional\\nequation either of which characterizes $\\\\Phi$. We use these facts to establish\\nan odd power series expansion of $n+\\\\frac12-\\\\tau_n$ in terms of\\n$(n+\\\\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of\\n$\\\\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\\\\\\\"{o}rmander and\\nBernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\\\\Phi$ arises from a commutation\\nrelation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential\\noperators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical\\ncomputations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.CV,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:54:58Z\"}"}
