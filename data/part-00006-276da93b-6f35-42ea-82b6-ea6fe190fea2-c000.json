{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07812v1\", \"title\": \"Numerical instability of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolutions\", \"summary\": \"The extreme sensitivity of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibiting the\\nnon-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has been extensively studied in recent years\\nwith well-established theoretical explanations. However, this sensitivity is\\noften overlooked in numerical calculations, as seen in Refs.\\n\\\\cite{NHSEEPTKawabata, Schiro}. In this work, we examine the solvable\\nHatano-Nelson and symplectic Hatano-Nelson models, comparing our high-precision\\nresults with those in Ref. \\\\cite{NHSEEPTKawabata}. We systematically\\ninvestigate inaccuracies in physical results arising from neglecting numerical\\nerrors during diagonalization and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution.\\nMoreover, we attribute these numerical instabilities to the large condition\\nnumber, which grows exponentially with system size due to NHSE, indicating\\nstrong normality. Interestingly, it is found that a reliable spectrum alone is\\ninsufficient for accurate non-Hermitian evolution, while the reliability of\\nwavefunctions plays a more critical role. To ensure the accuracy of numerical\\nresults for non-Hermitian systems exhibiting NHSE, our work underscores the\\nimportance of estimating the condition number before performing numerical\\ncomputations.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:50:22Z\"}"}
