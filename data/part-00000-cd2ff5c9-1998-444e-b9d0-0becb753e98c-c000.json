{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24243v1\", \"title\": \"Music Information Retrieval on Representative Mexican Folk Vocal\\n  Melodies Through MIDI Feature Extraction\", \"summary\": \"This study analyzes representative Mexican folk vocal melodies using MIDI\\nfeature extraction, examining ambitus, pitch-class entropy, and interval\\ndistribution. It also explores the relationship between these features and song\\npopularity, as measured by Spotify plays. The study employs MATLAB and the MIDI\\nToolbox for extracting musical features and performing statistical analysis.\\nThe findings reveal a significant variation in ambitus, with values ranging\\nfrom 8 to 27 semitones, indicating a diverse compositional style and vocal\\ndemand across the genre. The analysis of pitch-class entropy showcases a broad\\nspectrum of melodic complexity, with Armando Manzanero's `Somos Novios'\\ndisplaying the highest entropy, suggesting varied and complex melodic\\nstructures, while traditional pieces like `La Bamba' exhibit lower entropy,\\nindicating simpler, more repetitive patterns. The interval distribution\\npredominantly features prime intervals (P1), major and minor seconds (M2, m2),\\npointing to a compositional preference for close, contiguous intervals that\\ncontribute to the melodies' accessibility and appeal. Statistical analysis do\\nnot establish a significant correlation between the ambitus or entropy and the\\nnumber of Spotify plays.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:57:28Z\"}"}
