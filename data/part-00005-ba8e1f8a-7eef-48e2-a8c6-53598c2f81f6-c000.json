{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06995v1\", \"title\": \"Broadband Optical Modulation and Control at Millikelvin Temperatures\", \"summary\": \"A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on\\ncryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the\\nposition-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We\\nhave developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be\\nused to generate O({\\\\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy\\nrange of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber\\noptic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at\\ncryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of\\nany photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can\\nbe used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the\\nposition sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and\\nstudy the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe\\nthe design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained\\nwith a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin\\ntemperatures.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det,astro-ph.IM,hep-ex,nucl-ex,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:08:39Z\"}"}
