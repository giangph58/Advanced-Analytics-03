Magnetars are one of the main contenders. Some sources,\\nthe repeaters, produce multiple events but so far generally without the\\ncharacteristic periodicity that one could associate with the spin of a neutron\\nstar. We fit a geometrical model to the two main repeaters of the CHIME/FRB\\ncatalogue, namely FRB 20180814A and FRB 20180916B. Assuming the bursts\\noriginate from a magnetar's magnetosphere, we constrain the spin and magnetic\\nparameters of the star which are encoded into burst spectro-temporal\\nmorphologies. We estimate that a very strong toroidal magnetic component\\ntogether with spin periods of respectively $2.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5} ~ \\\\rm s$ and\\n$0.8_{-0.2}^{+0.1} ~ \\\\rm s$ best explain the data. We argue that this points\\ntowards young magnetars with super-twisted magnetospheres.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:33:25Z\"}"}
