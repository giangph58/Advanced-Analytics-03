However, the growing inter-dependencies have\\nintroduced numerous attack vectors, making supply chains a prime target for\\nexploitation. In particular, advanced persistent threats (APTs) frequently\\nleverage supply chain vulnerabilities (SCVs) as entry points, benefiting from\\ntheir inherent stealth. Current defense strategies primarly focus on prevention\\nthrough blockchain for integrity assurance or detection using plain-text source\\ncode analysis in open-source software (OSS). However, these approaches overlook\\nscenarios where source code is unavailable and fail to address detection and\\ndefense during runtime. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that\\nintegrates multi-source data, constructs a comprehensive dynamic provenance\\ngraph, and detects APT behavior in real time using temporal graph learning.\\nGiven the lack of tailored datasets in both industry and academia, we also aim\\nto simulate a custom dataset by replaying real-world supply chain exploits with\\nmulti-source monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:42:26Z\"}"}
