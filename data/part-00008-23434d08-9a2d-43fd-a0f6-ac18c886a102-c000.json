There is always a phase where\\nthe unique Gibbs state exhibits intermittent behavior. It is the only phase for\\na specific range of values of the H\\\\\\\"older exponent. For the remaining values\\nof the H\\\\\\\"older exponent, a second phase with stationary behavior emerges. In\\nthis case, a co-dimension 1 submanifold separates the intermittent and\\nstationary phases. It coincides with the set of potentials at which the\\npressure function fails to be real-analytic. We also describe the relationship\\nbetween the phase transition locus, (persistent) phase transitions in\\ntemperature, and ground states.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:40:05Z\"}"}
