Traditional\\ncomputational methods face a critical trade-off between computational cost and\\nefficiency.We present an enhanced machine-learning Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS)\\nmethod for improved electronic structure, DeePKS-ES, that overcomes this\\ndilemma. By incorporating the Hamiltonian matrix and their eigenvalues and\\neigenvectors into the loss function, we establish a universal model for water\\nsystems, which can reproduce high-level hybrid functional (HSE06) electronic\\nproperties from inexpensive generalized gradient approximation (PBE)\\ncalculations. Validated across molecular clusters and liquid-phase simulations,\\nour approach reliably predicts key electronic structure properties such as band\\ngaps and density of states, as well as total energy and atomic forces. This\\nwork bridges quantum-mechanical precision with scalable computation, offering\\ntransformative opportunities for modeling aqueous systems in catalysis, climate\\nscience, and energy storage.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,physics.atm-clus,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:13:47Z\"}"}
