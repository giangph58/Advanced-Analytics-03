{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01623v1\", \"title\": \"Log-concavity of characters of parabolic Verma modules, and of\\n  restricted Kostant partition functions\", \"summary\": \"In 2022, Huh-Matherne-Meszaros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur\\npolynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete)\\nlog-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type-$A$ root\\ndirections). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of\\nfinite-dimensional simple representations of $\\\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\\\\mathbb{C})$\\nare denormalized Lorentzian. In the same paper, these authors also showed that\\nshifted characters of Verma modules over $\\\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\\\\mathbb{C})$ are\\ndenormalized Lorentzian.\\n  In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that\\nsubsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic\\nVerma modules over $\\\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\\\\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized\\nLorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we\\nexplain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition\\nfunction of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and\\nnormalizing. In contrast, we show that a larger universal family of highest\\nweight modules, the higher order Verma modules, do not have discretely\\nlog-concave characters. Finally, we extend all of these results to parabolic\\n(i.e. \\\"first order\\\") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie\\nalgebras $\\\\oplus_{t=1}^T \\\\mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\\\\mathbb{C})$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:30:23Z\"}"}
