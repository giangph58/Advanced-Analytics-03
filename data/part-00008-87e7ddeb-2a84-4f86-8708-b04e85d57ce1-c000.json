{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05235v1\", \"title\": \"IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations\", \"summary\": \"The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing\\nanalyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions\\nand galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust\\ncosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods\\nthat break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce\\nIAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy\\nposition-position ($\\\\xi$), position-orientation ($\\\\omega$), and\\norientation-orientation ($\\\\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties\\nusing mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework.\\nCompared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\\\\xi$ and ~5% for\\n$\\\\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\\\\eta$ without overfitting. The\\nemulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify\\nregions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate\\ngeneralization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG\\nhydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu\\nenables $\\\\sim$10,000$\\\\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation\\nfunctions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration\\nfacilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a\\npowerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct\\napplications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:19:50Z\"}"}
