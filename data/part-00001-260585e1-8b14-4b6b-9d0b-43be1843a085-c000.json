In this study, we focus on probabilistic\\nimaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the\\ncontext of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are\\ndirectly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the\\nresults with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables\\nthrough repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the\\nHeisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We\\nfurther demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a\\nstate-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential\\nof error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations\\nfor near-term digital quantum simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:45:31Z\"}"}
