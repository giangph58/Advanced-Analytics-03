{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06087v1\", \"title\": \"Accurate Ab-initio Neural-network Solutions to Large-Scale Electronic\\n  Structure Problems\", \"summary\": \"We present finite-range embeddings (FiRE), a novel wave function ansatz for\\naccurate large-scale ab-initio electronic structure calculations. Compared to\\ncontemporary neural-network wave functions, FiRE reduces the asymptotic\\ncomplexity of neural-network variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) by $\\\\sim\\nn_\\\\text{el}$, the number of electrons. By restricting electron-electron\\ninteractions within the neural network, FiRE accelerates all key operations --\\nsampling, pseudopotentials, and Laplacian computations -- resulting in a\\nreal-world $10\\\\times$ acceleration in now-feasible 180-electron calculations.\\nWe validate our method's accuracy on various challenging systems, including\\nbiochemical compounds, conjugated hydrocarbons, and organometallic compounds.\\nOn these systems, FiRE's energies are consistently within chemical accuracy of\\nthe most reliable data, including experiments, even in cases where\\nhigh-accuracy methods such as CCSD(T), AFQMC, or contemporary NN-VMC fall\\nshort. With these improvements in both runtime and accuracy, FiRE represents a\\nnew `gold-standard' method for fast and accurate large-scale ab-initio\\ncalculations, potentially enabling new computational studies in fields like\\nquantum chemistry, solid-state physics, and material design.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cs.LG,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:28:54Z\"}"}
