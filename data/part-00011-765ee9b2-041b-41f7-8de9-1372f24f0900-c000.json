However, previous\\nmethods utilize 3D priors that lack detailed and complex structural\\ninformation, limiting them to generating simple objects and presenting\\nchallenges for creating intricate structures such as bonsai. In this paper, we\\npropose 3DBonsai, a novel text-to-3D framework for generating 3D bonsai with\\ncomplex structures. Technically, we first design a trainable 3D space\\ncolonization algorithm to produce bonsai structures, which are then enhanced\\nthrough random sampling and point cloud augmentation to serve as the 3D\\nGaussian priors. We introduce two bonsai generation pipelines with distinct\\nstructural levels: fine structure conditioned generation, which initializes 3D\\nGaussians using a 3D structure prior to produce detailed and complex bonsai,\\nand coarse structure conditioned generation, which employs a multi-view\\nstructure consistency module to align 2D and 3D structures. Moreover, we have\\ncompiled a unified 2D and 3D Chinese-style bonsai dataset. Our experimental\\nresults demonstrate that 3DBonsai significantly outperforms existing methods,\\nproviding a new benchmark for structure-aware 3D bonsai generation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:27:02Z\"}"}
