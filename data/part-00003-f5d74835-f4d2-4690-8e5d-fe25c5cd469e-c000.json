This paper\\nintroduces a multi-level grading and classification system that combines\\nBayesian probabilistic modeling with scenario-based performance thresholds to\\nassess the reusability of end-of-life modular components. By grading components\\nacross a five-tier scale, the system supports strategic decisions for reuse,\\nup-use, or down-use, ensuring alignment with engineering standards and\\nsustainability objectives. The model's development is grounded in empirical\\ndata from precast concrete wall panels, and its explainability is enhanced\\nthrough decision tree logic and Sankey visualizations that trace the influence\\nof contextual scenarios on classification outcomes. MGCS addresses the\\nenvironmental, economic, and operational challenges of EoL management--reducing\\nmaterial waste, optimizing value recovery, and improving workflow efficiency.\\nThrough dynamic feature weighting and transparent reasoning, the system offers\\na practical yet rigorous pathway to embed circular thinking into construction\\nindustry practices.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,cs.NA,math.NA,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:14:02Z\"}"}
