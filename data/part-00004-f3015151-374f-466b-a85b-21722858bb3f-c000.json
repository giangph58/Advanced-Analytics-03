All of them\\ncan be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions.\\nNevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the\\nsame sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign\\ncomponents, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic\\nmodel remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{S}|{\\\\bf t}\\n\\\\}$, combining the shift ${\\\\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices\\nto each other with the spin flip $\\\\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure\\nremains Kramers-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing\\na possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic\\nsplitting of bands, breaking the $\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{S}|{\\\\bf t}\\\\}$ symmetry, does not\\nplay a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain,\\nresponsible for finite values of AHE and OM.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:15:47Z\"}"}
