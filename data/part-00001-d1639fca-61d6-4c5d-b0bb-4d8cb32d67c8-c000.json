This approach is\\nbased on lifting the given polynomial coefficient functionals $J(f) =\\nJ(c_{m_1}, \\\\dots, c_{m_s}), 2 < c_{m_1} < \\\\dots < c_{m_s} < \\\\infty$, onto the\\nBers fiber space over universal Teichmuller space and applying the analytic and\\ngeometric features of Teichm\\\\\\\"{u}ller spaces, especially the Bers isomorphism\\ntheorem for Teichmuller spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces.\\n  In this paper, we extend this approach to more general classes of functions.\\nIn particular, this provides a strengthening of de Branges' theorem solving the\\nBieberbach conjecture.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:12:22Z\"}"}
