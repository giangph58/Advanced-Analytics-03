As these AI systems become increasingly integrated into\\nworkflows, they offer unprecedented opportunities for augmenting human thinking\\nwhile simultaneously risking cognitive erosion through passive consumption of\\ngenerated answers. This tension is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks,\\nwhere effective solutions require deep contextualization and integration of\\ndomain knowledge. Unlike structured tasks with established metrics, measuring\\nthe quality of human-LLM interaction in such open-ended tasks poses significant\\nchallenges due to the absence of ground truth and the iterative nature of\\nsolution development. To address this, we present a framework that analyzes\\ninteraction patterns along two dimensions: cognitive activity mode (exploration\\nvs. exploitation) and cognitive engagement mode (constructive vs. detrimental).\\nThis framework provides systematic measurements to evaluate when LLMs are\\neffective tools for thought rather than substitutes for human cognition,\\nadvancing theoretical understanding and practical guidance for developing AI\\nsystems that protect and augment human cognitive capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:20:36Z\"}"}
