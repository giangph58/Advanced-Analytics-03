We extend this\\nresult to the renormalized entanglement entropy of a non-minimally coupled\\nscalar field. From the on-shell perspective, entropy emerges as a bulk\\ncontribution, whereas from the off-shell viewpoint, it manifests as a boundary\\n(horizon) contribution. As a result, in de Sitter space, generalized entropy\\ncan be understood in two distinct ways: either as a bulk or as a boundary\\ncontribution.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:48:35Z\"}"}
