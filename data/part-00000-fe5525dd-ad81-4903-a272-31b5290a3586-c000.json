Using\\nthis formula, we classify distance one surgeries between lens spaces of the\\nform $L(n,1)$. This classification has direct applications to band surgeries\\nbetween torus links $T(2,n)$, with connections to DNA topology. In particular,\\nwe show that chirally cosmetic banding of torus links can possibly occur only\\nwhen $n=1,5,9$ or $10$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:56:26Z\"}"}
