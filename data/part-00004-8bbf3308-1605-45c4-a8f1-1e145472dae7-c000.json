{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01671v1\", \"title\": \"Anomaly Detection for Hybrid Butterfly Subspecies via Probability\\n  Filtering\", \"summary\": \"Detecting butterfly hybrids requires knowledge of the parent subspecies, and\\nthe process can be tedious when encountering a new subspecies. This study\\nfocuses on a specific scenario where a model trained to recognize hybrid\\nspecies A can generalize to species B when B biologically mimics A. Since\\nspecies A and B share similar patterns, we leverage BioCLIP as our feature\\nextractor to capture features based on their taxonomy. Consequently, the\\nalgorithm designed for species A can be transferred to B, as their hybrid and\\nnon-hybrid patterns exhibit similar relationships. To determine whether a\\nbutterfly is a hybrid, we adopt proposed probability filtering and color\\njittering to augment and simulate the mimicry. With these approaches, we\\nachieve second place in the official development phase. Our code is publicly\\navailable at https://github.com/Justin900429/NSF-HDR-Challenge.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:18:44Z\"}"}
