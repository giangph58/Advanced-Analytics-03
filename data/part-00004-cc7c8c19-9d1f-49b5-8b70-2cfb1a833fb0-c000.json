{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05780v1\", \"title\": \"Magnetic Memory Driven by Orbital Current\", \"summary\": \"Spin-orbitronics, based on both spin and orbital angular momentum, presents a\\npromising pathway for energy-efficient memory and logic devices. Recent studies\\nhave demonstrated the emergence of orbital currents in light transition metals\\nsuch as Ti, Cr, and Zr, broadening the scope of spin-orbit torque (SOT). In\\nparticular, the orbital Hall effect, which arises independently of spin-obit\\ncoupling, has shown potential for enhancing torque efficiency in spintronic\\ndevices. However, the direct integration of orbital current into magnetic\\nrandom-access memory (MRAM) remains unexplored. In this work, we design a light\\nmetal/heavy metal/ferromagnet multilayer structure and experimentally\\ndemonstrate magnetization switching by orbital current. Furthermore, we have\\nrealized a robust SOT-MRAM cell by incorporating a reference layer that is\\npinned by a synthetic antiferromagnetic structure. We observed a tunnel\\nmagnetoresistance of 66%, evident in both magnetic field and current-driven\\nswitching processes. Our findings underscore the potential for employing\\norbital current in designing next-generation spintronic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:03:31Z\"}"}
