We also use improved mass estimates from FLAMES, and we add refinements\\nto previous modelling of the triple and other populations and the\\nmodel-fitting. We fit histograms of observed vs Newtonian velocity differences\\nto a flexible mixture of binary + triple populations with realistic\\neccentricity distributions, plus unbound flyby and random-chance populations.\\nWe find as before that Newtonian models provide a significantly better fit than\\nMOND, though improved understanding of the triple population is necessary to\\nmake this fully decisive.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:00:49Z\"}"}
