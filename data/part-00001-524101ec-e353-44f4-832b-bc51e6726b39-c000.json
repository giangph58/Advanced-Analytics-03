We\\nalso show that the initial ideal with respect to the degree reverse\\nlexicographical ordering of the annihilator ideal of the complete symmetric\\nform has this property, by determining a minimal Gr\\\\\\\"obner basis of it.\\nMoreover, we determine the total Betti numbers for a class of strongly stable\\nmonomial ideals and show that these numbers agree with those for the degree\\nreverse lexicographical initial ideals of the ideal generated by a sufficiently\\nlarge number of generic forms, and of the annihilator ideal of a generic form.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:10:14Z\"}"}
