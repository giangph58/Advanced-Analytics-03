The calculations\\ncan be performed in the presence of dc magnetic fields, dc electric fields and\\nfar off-resonant optical fields. We additionally include functions to calculate\\nthe polarisability of the molecule and the transition dipole moment between\\ndifferent energy eigenstates. The package is applicable to many of the\\nmolecules which can be laser cooled, specifically the alkaline earth fluorides.\\nWe provide a constants file which includes many of the required literature\\nvalues for CaF, SrF and BaF. Additional species can easily be added by updating\\nthis file.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:31:06Z\"}"}
