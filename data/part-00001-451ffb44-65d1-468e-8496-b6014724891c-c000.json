{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06007v1\", \"title\": \"CAMulator: Fast Emulation of the Community Atmosphere Model\", \"summary\": \"We introduce CAMulator version 1, an auto-regressive machine-learned (ML)\\nemulator of the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) that simulates the\\nnext atmospheric state given the prescribed sea surface temperatures and\\nincoming solar radiation. CAMulator explicitly conserves global dry air mass,\\nmoisture, and total atmospheric energy while remaining numerically stable over\\nindefinite climate integrations. It successfully reproduces the annual CAM6\\nclimatology and key modes of climate variability, including the El\\nNi\\\\~no-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the\\nPacific-North American pattern, with slightly muted variability. When forced\\nwith sea surface temperature (SST) outside the training distribution, CAMulator\\nexhibits a systematic cold bias in high-latitude regions, particularly in\\nboreal winter, likely due to the absence of interactive land and sea ice.\\nNonetheless, CAMulator achieves these results with a 350 times speedup over\\nCAM6, making it an efficient alternative for generating large ensembles.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:15:48Z\"}"}
