We show that many known aggregation\\noperations can be interpreted as (double) functors on appropriate (double)\\ncategories. Such functorial aggregations are amenable to parallel\\nimplementation via straightforward extensions of Blelloch's parallel scan\\nalgorithm. In addition to providing a unified viewpoint on existing operations,\\nit allows us to propose new aggregation operations for time-series and image\\ndata.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CT\", \"categories\": \"math.CT,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:12:20Z\"}"}
