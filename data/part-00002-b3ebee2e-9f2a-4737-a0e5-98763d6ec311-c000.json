{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05848v1\", \"title\": \"Relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of a\\n  quantum clock\", \"summary\": \"We provide a brief discussion regarding relativistic limits on the\\ndiscretization and temporal resolution of time values in a quantum clock. Our\\nclock is characterized by a time observable chosen to be the complement of a\\nbounded and discrete Hamiltonian which can have an equally-spaced or a generic\\nspectrum. In the first case the time observable can be described by an\\nHermitian operator and we find a limit in the discretization for the time\\neigenvalues. Nevertheless, in both cases, the time observable can be described\\nby a POVM and, by increasing the number of time states, we can arbitrarily\\nreduce the bound on the minimum time quantum, demonstrating that we can safely\\ntake the time values as continuous when the number of time states tends to\\ninfinity. Finally, we find a limit for temporal resolution of our time\\nobservable when the clock is used (together with light signals) in a\\nrelativistic framework for measuring spacetime distances.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:27:41Z\"}"}
