{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06985v1\", \"title\": \"M-theory boundaries beyond supersymmetry\", \"summary\": \"The chiral worldvolume theory of an M-theory boundary (the so-called M9\\nbrane) is uniquely determined by supersymmetry and anomaly inflow. In this\\nbrief note we investigate whether alternative chiral boundary field contents\\nmay be allowed by anomaly cancellation once supersymmetry is dropped. Even\\nthen, anomaly inflow places stringent constraints on the gauge group $G$ and\\nmatter content of the boundary worldvolume theory, which we determine\\nexplicitly. We find the most general solution to these constraints in the case\\nwhere all matter fields are of the same chirality, for all simple Lie algebras\\nexcept $\\\\mathfrak{sp}_2$, $\\\\mathfrak{su}_{n\\\\leq5}$, and $\\\\mathfrak{so}_{n}$\\nwith $7\\\\leq n\\\\leq 12$, and find no solutions other than the supersymmetric\\n$E_8$ boundary of Ho\\\\v{r}ava and Witten. However, when we extend our search to\\nallow for any chirality in the matter fields, we find one minimal solution with\\ngauge group $G_2$, charged matter in the $\\\\mathsf{14}$, $\\\\mathsf{27}$ and\\n$\\\\mathsf{77}$ representations, which satisfies all constraints in a non-trivial\\nway. Therefore, it could in principle describe the low-energy theory of a novel\\nnonsupersymmetric M-theory boundary condition, different from the\\nHo\\\\v{r}ava-Witten proposal. We briefly discuss some consequences if this was\\nindeed the case, such as the existence of a non-supersymmetric, exotic\\n\\\"$G_2$-string\\\" CFT in 6d, and a novel, non-perturbative, heterotic-like 10d\\nstring with gauge group $G_2\\\\times G_2$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:45:46Z\"}"}
