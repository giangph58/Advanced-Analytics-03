Nonlinear pulsations of stripped helium stars\", \"summary\": \"It is shown for the first time that the stripped helium stars with masses 2\\nto 7 solar mass which are formed in close binary systems in the so-called case\\nB of mass-exchange and retained low-mass hydrogen-helium envelopes, experience\\nnonlinear radial pulsations. Pulsations are excited by the kappa-mechanism due\\nto helium ionization. The region of pulsation instability extends over\\nHertzsprung-Russel diagram from the red giants branch to the region of\\neffective temperatures from about 30,000 K to about 50,000 K. Variations of\\nstellar luminosity should be observed mostly in the ultraviolet. The amplitudes\\nof pulsations of the studied models reach 0.8 stellar magnitude and increase,\\nas the stellar radii decrease. Pulsation periods of stars with effective\\ntemperatures exceeding 10,000 K range from 0.17 to 8.5 day and decrease with\\ndecreasing radii. The stars have substantially larger effective temperatures\\nthan their companions, which could be Be-stars. They are components of\\nrelatively wide binaries with orbital periods up to several years. The number\\nof pulsating moderate-mass stripped helium stars in the Galaxy is about 1000.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:34:42Z\"}"}
