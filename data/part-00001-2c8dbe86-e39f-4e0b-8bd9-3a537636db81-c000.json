{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720v1\", \"title\": \"On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals\", \"summary\": \"We present a systematic method for the construction of canonical bases for\\nunivariate elliptic Feynman integrals with multiple kinematic scales, which\\nfrequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The\\nconstruction is performed in the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where\\nthe geometric propoerties of the curves are simple and explicit and further\\nkinemtic singularities are present as marked points. The canonical bases are\\nconstructed using Abelian differentials of three kinds with a universal linear\\ntransformation. The bases constructed in the normal form can be mapped to\\ngeneric integral families via an appropriate M\\\\\\\"obius transformation. As a\\ndemonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete\\nexamples, where we show that the $\\\\varepsilon$-factorization of sub-sector\\ndependence can also be simply done. Our method can be readily applied to more\\ncomplicated integral families straightforwardly.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:42:54Z\"}"}
