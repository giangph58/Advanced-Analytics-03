A locally\\npolynomial estimator is constructed, where an orthonormal basis and various\\ntuning parameters remain to be selected. We provide a general asymptotic upper\\nbound on the estimation error and show that this procedure achieves polynomial\\nconvergence rates under appropriate tuning and supersmoothness of the\\nregression function. Such polynomial convergence rates have usually been\\nconsidered to be non-attainable in nonparametric functional regression without\\nany additional strong structural constraints such as linearity of the\\nregression function.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:02:02Z\"}"}
