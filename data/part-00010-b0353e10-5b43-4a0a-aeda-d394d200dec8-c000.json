The $p$-Sobolev and Gagliardo-Nirenberg\\ninequalities, as well as the spectral gap in $W^{1,p}_0(\\\\Sigma)$ are derived as\\ncorollaries. Using these PSIs, we prove a sharp $p$-Log-Sobolev inequality for\\nminimal submanifolds in codimension one and two. The asymptotic sharpness of\\nboth the multiplicative constant appearing in PSIs and the assumption on the\\ntotal mean curvature bound as $n\\\\to \\\\infty$ is provided. A second equivalent\\nversion of our PSIs is presented in the appendix of this paper, introducing the\\nnotion of model space $(\\\\mathbb{R}^+,\\\\mathfrak{m}_{n,K})$ of dimension $n$ and\\ntotal mean curvature bounded by $K$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:07:34Z\"}"}
