{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04767v1\", \"title\": \"Extended URDF: Accounting for parallel mechanism in robot description\", \"summary\": \"Robotic designs played an important role in recent advances by providing\\npowerful robots with complex mechanics. Many recent systems rely on parallel\\nactuation to provide lighter limbs and allow more complex motion. However,\\nthese emerging architectures fall outside the scope of most used description\\nformats, leading to difficulties when designing, storing, and sharing the\\nmodels of these systems. This paper introduces an extension to the widely used\\nUnified Robot Description Format (URDF) to support closed-loop kinematic\\nstructures. Our approach relies on augmenting URDF with minimal additional\\ninformation to allow more efficient modeling of complex robotic systems while\\nmaintaining compatibility with existing design and simulation frameworks. This\\nmethod sets the basic requirement for a description format to handle parallel\\nmechanisms efficiently. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by\\nproviding an open-source collection of parallel robots, along with tools for\\ngenerating and parsing this extended description format. The proposed extension\\nsimplifies robot modeling, reduces redundancy, and improves usability for\\nadvanced robotic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:42:27Z\"}"}
