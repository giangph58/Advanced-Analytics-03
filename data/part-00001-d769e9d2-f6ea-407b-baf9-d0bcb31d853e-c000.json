We find ansatzes reducing system of partial differential\\nequations to system of ordinary differential equations. The method is applied\\nto system related to Korteweg -- de Vries (KdV) equation, and\\nreaction-diffusion equations. We have also shown the possibility of\\nconstructing solution to system of non-evolutionary equations, which contains\\none or two arbitrary functions.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,math-ph,math.AP,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:43:36Z\"}"}
