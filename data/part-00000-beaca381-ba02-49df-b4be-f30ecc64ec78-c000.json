Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and\\nMgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio\\nstructure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as\\naround 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal\\ntransition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being\\napplicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a\\nnon-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the\\nstability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing\\nwith He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa\\ndown to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a\\nsimple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas\\nsubstitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He\\npreferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He\\ndemonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under\\nultra-high pressures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.other,physics.chem-ph,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:25:09Z\"}"}
