In this work, we present\\nan approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds\\nacquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the\\nrobot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and\\napplies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with\\nadditional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and\\nlow-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification\\nto distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal\\nstrategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is\\nvalidated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the\\nvelocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental\\nresults show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the\\nmotion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:57:51Z\"}"}
