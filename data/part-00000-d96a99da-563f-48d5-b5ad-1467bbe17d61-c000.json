By integrating these arbitrary polarization retarders with\\narbitrary polarization rotators, we develop a versatile device capable of\\nperforming arbitrary-to-arbitrary polarization transformations. While some of\\nthe proposed devices are documented in the literature, others are novel and, to\\nthe best of our knowledge, have not been previously presented. The continuous\\nadjustment of retardance and rotation in these devices is achieved by altering\\nthe relative orientation of the wave plates in the sequence.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:38:10Z\"}"}
