In this paper\\nwe propose an alternative perspective to study this problem by comparing the\\ndecidabilities of LU equivalence (also known as LU decidabilities for short)\\nbetween entanglement witnesses and states. We introduce a relation between sets\\nof Hermitian operators in terms of the LU decidability. Then we compare the LU\\ndecidability for the set of entanglement witness to those decidabilities for\\nseveral sets of states, and establish a hierarchy on LU decidabilities for\\nthese sets. Moreover, we realize that the simultaneous LU (SLU) equivalence\\nbetween tuples of mutually orthogonal projectors is crucial to LU equivalent\\noperators. We reveal by examples that for two tuples of projectors, the partial\\nSLU equivalence cannot ensure the overall SLU equivalence. Generally, we\\npresent a necessary and sufficient condition such that two tuples of states are\\nSLU equivalent.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:05:53Z\"}"}
