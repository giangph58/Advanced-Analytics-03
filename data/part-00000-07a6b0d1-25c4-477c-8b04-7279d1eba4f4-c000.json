{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21673v1\", \"title\": \"A friendly introduction to triangular transport\", \"summary\": \"Decision making under uncertainty is a cross-cutting challenge in science and\\nengineering. Most approaches to this challenge employ probabilistic\\nrepresentations of uncertainty. In complicated systems accessible only via data\\nor black-box models, however, these representations are rarely known. We\\ndiscuss how to characterize and manipulate such representations using\\ntriangular transport maps, which approximate any complex probability\\ndistribution as a transformation of a simple, well-understood distribution. The\\nparticular structure of triangular transport guarantees many desirable\\nmathematical and computational properties that translate well into solving\\npractical problems. Triangular maps are actively used for density estimation,\\n(conditional) generative modelling, Bayesian inference, data assimilation,\\noptimal experimental design, and related tasks. While there is ample literature\\non the development and theory of triangular transport methods, this manuscript\\nprovides a detailed introduction for scientists interested in employing measure\\ntransport without assuming a formal mathematical background. We build intuition\\nfor the key foundations of triangular transport, discuss many aspects of its\\npractical implementation, and outline the frontiers of this field.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.CO\", \"categories\": \"stat.CO,physics.ao-ph,stat.ME,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:41:14Z\"}"}
