We combine\\nexperiments and numerical simulations to investigate their shape dynamics under\\nvarying levels of confinement and particle flexibility. A transition from an\\noblate to a bullet-like shape is observed at a confinement threshold,\\nindependent of flexibility. A fluid-structure interaction analysis reveals two\\nregimes: a pressure-dominated and a viscous-dominated regime. For highly\\nflexible particles, the pressure-dominated regime prevails and the deformation\\nis enhanced. These findings offer new insights into the transport of flexible\\nparticles in confined environments, with implications for biomedical\\napplications, filtration technologies, and multiphase fluid mechanics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:38:07Z\"}"}
