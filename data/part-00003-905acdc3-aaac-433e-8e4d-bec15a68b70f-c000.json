The magnetic susceptibility, $\\\\chi(T)$, follows the\\nCurie--Weiss law from 300 K to 20 K, as expected for a free Pr$^{3+}$ ion. As\\nthe temperature decreases below 5 K, $\\\\chi(T)$ approaches a constant,\\nindicating van-Vleck paramagnetic behavior. The specific heat, $C(T)$, displays\\na broad shoulder at around 4 K, which can be reproduced by a doublet triplet\\ntwo-level model with an energy gap of 12 K. These results suggest a\\nnon-magnetic $\\\\Gamma_3$ doublet ground state of the Pr$^{3+}$ ion in the cubic\\ncrystalline electric field. $C(T)$ exhibits a peak at $T_{\\\\rm O}$ = 1.0 K and\\nthis peak remains robust against magnetic fields up to 5 T. In powder neutron\\ndiffraction measurements, no magnetic reflection was observed at 0.32 K $<$\\n$T_{\\\\rm O}$. Two anomalies at $B$ = 2.1 and 5.3 T in magnetoresistance\\n$\\\\rho(B)$ at 0.05 K likely originate from switching in the order parameter.\\nThese results suggest that the phase transition at $T_{\\\\rm O}$ is ascribed to\\nan antiferro-type order of the electric quadrupole or magnetic octupole of the\\n$\\\\Gamma_3$ doublet in the 4$f^2$ fcc lattice.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:45:38Z\"}"}
