Its\\nreal part, the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), has a\\nmeasurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguishability.\\nHowever, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental\\ninaccessibility of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here\\nwe introduce a counterpart to the QGT that includes measurement operators,\\ntermed the \\\\textit{semi-classical} geometric tensor (SCGT). We show that the\\nSCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover,\\nwe use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss\\nextensions of the Berry phase.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:06:57Z\"}"}
