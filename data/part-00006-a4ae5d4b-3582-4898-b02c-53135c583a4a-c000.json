However, a gap remains in comprehending how\\nmutations, both additive and multiplicative, as well as institutional\\nincentives, influence these dynamics. In this paper, we study the\\nreplicator-mutator dynamics, with combined additive and multiplicative\\nmutations, for public goods games both in the absence or presence of\\ninstitutional incentives. For each model, we identify the possible number of\\n(stable) equilibria, demonstrate their attainability, as well as analyse their\\nstability properties. We also characterise the dependence of these equilibria\\non the model's parameters via bifurcation analysis and asymptotic behaviour.\\nOur results offer rigorous and quantitative insights into the role of\\ninstitutional incentives and the effect of combined additive and multiplicative\\nmutations on the evolution of cooperation in the context of public goods games.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:20:11Z\"}"}
