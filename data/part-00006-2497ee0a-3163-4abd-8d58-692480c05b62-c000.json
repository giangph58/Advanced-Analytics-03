In\\nprior work, we developed a new approach for identifying and preventing\\ncascading failures in power systems. The approach uses supervisory control\\ntechnique of discrete event systems (DES) by incorporating both on-line\\nlookahead control and forcible events. In this paper, we use modular\\nsupervisory control of DES to reduce computation complexity and increase the\\nrobustness and reliability of control. Modular supervisory control allows us to\\npredict and mitigate cascading failures in power systems more effectively. We\\nimplemented the proposed control technique on a simulation platform developed\\nin MATLAB and applied the proposed DES controller. The calculations of modular\\nsupervisory control of DES are performed using an external tool and imported\\ninto the MATLAB platform. We conduct simulation studies for the IEEE 30-bus,\\n118-bus and 300-bus systems, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour proposed approach.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T06:53:35Z\"}"}
