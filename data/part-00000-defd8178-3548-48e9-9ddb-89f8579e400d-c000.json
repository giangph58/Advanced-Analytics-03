{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23793v1\", \"title\": \"Pan-LUT: Efficient Pan-sharpening via Learnable Look-Up Tables\", \"summary\": \"Recently, deep learning-based pan-sharpening algorithms have achieved notable\\nadvancements over traditional methods. However, many deep learning-based\\napproaches incur substantial computational overhead during inference,\\nespecially with high-resolution images. This excessive computational demand\\nlimits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, particularly\\nin the absence of dedicated computing devices such as GPUs and TPUs. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose Pan-LUT, a novel learnable look-up table (LUT)\\nframework for pan-sharpening that strikes a balance between performance and\\ncomputational efficiency for high-resolution remote sensing images. To finely\\ncontrol the spectral transformation, we devise the PAN-guided look-up table\\n(PGLUT) for channel-wise spectral mapping. To effectively capture fine-grained\\nspatial details and adaptively learn local contexts, we introduce the spatial\\ndetails look-up table (SDLUT) and adaptive aggregation look-up table (AALUT).\\nOur proposed method contains fewer than 300K parameters and processes a 8K\\nresolution image in under 1 ms using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU,\\ndemonstrating significantly faster performance compared to other methods.\\nExperiments reveal that Pan-LUT efficiently processes large remote sensing\\nimages in a lightweight manner, bridging the gap to real-world applications.\\nFurthermore, our model surpasses SOTA methods in full-resolution scenes under\\nreal-world conditions, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:13:59Z\"}"}
