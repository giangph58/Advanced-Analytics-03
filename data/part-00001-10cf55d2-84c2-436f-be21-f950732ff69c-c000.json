Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum\\ntreatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum\\ntreatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of\\nunknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when\\nsimulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the\\ndisruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs\\nwhen truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects\\nas regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates\\nintimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators. In addition,\\nwe discuss the relevance of choosing an adequate primitive basis set within the\\npresent context with respect to its variational convergence properties. Such\\nfundamental, yet consequential, aspects are illustrated numerically in the\\npresent work on a one-dimensional anharmonic Hamiltonian model corresponding to\\na double-well potential showing strong tunneling, of interest both for\\nvibrational spectroscopy and chemical reactivity.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:52:04Z\"}"}
