We discuss which\\nelements shall be considered and the role they play to achieve a robust control\\nin a variety of conditions. In particular, four different studies are reviewed,\\neach of them investigating in detail important elements encountered in crowd\\nsteering and control. More specifically synchronization, compliance, crowd (or\\nswarm) density and human perception are studied showing the role they play in\\ncombination. Ultimately, the success of a control strategy is determined by\\ncarefully considering the effect each element has on individuals, but also on\\nthe interactions between them, leading to the creation of a collective\\nbehavior. We will also highlight the importance of psychological and cognitive\\nfactors when dealing with human crowds, hinting at the fact that automatic\\ncontrol systems may achieve optimal performance, but may be not necessarily\\nwell perceived by people in terms of comfort. The discussion aims at showing\\nrecent trends and potentialities of crowd control systems, but should also warn\\non the risk in choosing a solution prioritizing optimization toward people's\\nsafety or comfort.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:46:36Z\"}"}
