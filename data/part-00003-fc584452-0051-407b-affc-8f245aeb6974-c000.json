{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23724v1\", \"title\": \"Colossal enhancement of spin transmission through magnon confinement in\\n  an antiferromagnet\", \"summary\": \"Since Felix Bloch's introduction of the concept of spin waves in 1930,\\nmagnons (the quanta of spin waves) have been extensively studied in a range of\\nmaterials for spintronics, particularly for non-volatile logic-in-memory\\ndevices. Controlling magnons in conventional antiferromagnets and harnessing\\nthem in practical applications, however, remains a challenge. In this letter,\\nwe demonstrate highly efficient magnon transport in an\\nLaFeO$_3$/BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$ all-antiferromagnetic system which can be\\ncontrolled electrically, making it highly desirable for energy-efficient\\ncomputation. Leveraging spin-orbit-driven spin-charge transduction, we\\ndemonstrate that this material architecture permits magnon confinement in\\nultrathin antiferromagnets, enhancing the output voltage generated by magnon\\ntransport by several orders of magnitude, which provides a pathway to enable\\nmagnetoelectric memory and logic functionalities. Additionally, its\\nnon-volatility enables ultralow-power logic-in-memory processing, where\\nmagnonic devices can be efficiently reconfigured via electrically controlled\\nmagnon spin currents within magnetoelectric channels.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:52:59Z\"}"}
