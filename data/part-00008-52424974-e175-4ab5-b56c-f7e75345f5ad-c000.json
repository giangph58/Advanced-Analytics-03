In this paper, we present a novel framework for\\nrobust topology optimization with partial differential equation constraints to\\naddress this challenge. The robust optimization problem is formulated as a\\nmin-max optimization problem, where the inner maximization is the worst case\\nwith respect to predefined uncertainties, while the outer minimization aims to\\nfind an optimal topology that remains robust under these uncertainties using\\nthe topological derivative. The shape of the domain is represented by a level\\nset function, which allows for arbitrary perturbation of the domain. The robust\\noptimization problem is solved using a theorem of Clarke to compute\\nsubgradients of the worst case function. This allows the min-max problem to be\\nsolved efficiently and ensures that we find a design that performs well even in\\nthe presence of uncertainty. Finally, numerical results for a two-material\\npermanent magnet synchronous machine demonstrate both the effectiveness of the\\nmethod and the improved performance of robust designs under uncertain\\nconditions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:38:20Z\"}"}
