Two\\ninfinite-dimensional subspaces $V,W \\\\subseteq E$ are almost disjoint if $V \\\\cap\\nW$ is finite-dimensional. This paper provides some improvements on results\\nabout the definability of maximal almost disjoint families (mad families) of\\nsubspaces in [17]. We show that a full mad family of block subspaces exists\\nassuming either $\\\\frak{p} = \\\\max\\\\{\\\\frak{b},\\\\frak{s}\\\\}$ or a positive answer to\\na problem in [17], improving Smythe's construction assuming $\\\\frak{p} =\\n\\\\frak{c}$. We also discuss the abstract Mathias forcing introduced by Di\\nPrisco-Mijares-Nieto in [11], and apply it to show that in the Solovay's model\\nobtained by the collapse of a Mahlo cardinal, there are no full mad families of\\nblock subspaces over $\\\\mathbb{F}_2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:24:19Z\"}"}
