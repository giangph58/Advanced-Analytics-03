{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02808v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum theory does not need complex numbers\", \"summary\": \"The longstanding debate over whether quantum theory fundamentally requires\\ncomplex numbers--or if their use is merely a convenient choice--has persisted\\nfor decades. Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in\\n[M.-O. Renou et al, Nature 600, 625-629, 2021], a decisive argument was\\npresented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers. In this work, we\\ndemonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers\\nis indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation\\nlocality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to\\nthe states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We\\nobserve that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was\\nderived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By\\nstarting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive\\na combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties\\nanalogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that\\nthe conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and\\nrepresentation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the\\nstate space. We thus conclude that complex numbers are a mere convenience in\\nquantum theory.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:53:19Z\"}"}
