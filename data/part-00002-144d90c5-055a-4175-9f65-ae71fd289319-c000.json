{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01905v1\", \"title\": \"Accelerating IoV Intrusion Detection: Benchmarking GPU-Accelerated vs\\n  CPU-Based ML Libraries\", \"summary\": \"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) may face challenging cybersecurity attacks\\nthat may require sophisticated intrusion detection systems, necessitating a\\nrapid development and response system. This research investigates the\\nperformance advantages of GPU-accelerated libraries (cuML) compared to\\ntraditional CPU-based implementations (scikit-learn), focusing on the speed and\\nefficiency required for machine learning models used in IoV threat detection\\nenvironments. The comprehensive evaluations conducted employ four machine\\nlearning approaches (Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) across\\nthree distinct IoV security datasets (OTIDS, GIDS, CICIoV2024). Our findings\\ndemonstrate that GPU-accelerated implementations dramatically improved\\ncomputational efficiency, with training times reduced by a factor of up to 159\\nand prediction speeds accelerated by up to 95 times compared to traditional CPU\\nprocessing, all while preserving detection accuracy. This remarkable\\nperformance breakthrough empowers researchers and security specialists to\\nharness GPU acceleration for creating faster, more effective threat detection\\nsystems that meet the urgent real-time security demands of today's connected\\nvehicle networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:04:53Z\"}"}
