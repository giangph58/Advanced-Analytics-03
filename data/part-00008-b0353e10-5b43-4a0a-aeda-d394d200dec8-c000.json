Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated\\ncombs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we\\npropose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency\\ncomb-that does not rely on intrinsic non-linearity. By periodically modulating\\nthe resonance frequency of a cavity, a giant-mode cavity with multiple equally\\nspaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the\\npre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach\\noffers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner,\\nobviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation thresholds. We implement\\nthis on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr\\noptomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal\\nfar from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection\\nis reduced by approximately a factor of ($10^6$), providing a promising\\nplatform for frequency comb generation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:05:20Z\"}"}
