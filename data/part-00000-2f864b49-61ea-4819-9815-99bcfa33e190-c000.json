{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24045v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluating Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Dynamics\\n  Algorithms on the Advection-Diffusion Equation\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving\\npartial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional\\nadvection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a\\nground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three\\nleading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum\\nImaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics\\nSimulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While\\nTrotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms\\nthat reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.\\nHowever, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due\\nto noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance\\nbaseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector\\nsimulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as\\n${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming\\nhardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\\\\gtrsim 10^{-2}$. By\\ncomparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess\\ntheir accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum\\nPDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential\\nextensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and\\nfinance.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CE,cs.ET\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:09:59Z\"}"}
