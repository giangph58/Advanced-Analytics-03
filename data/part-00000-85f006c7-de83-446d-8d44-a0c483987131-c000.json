{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06924v1\", \"title\": \"Longitudinal Assessment of Lung Lesion Burden in CT\", \"summary\": \"In the U.S., lung cancer is the second major cause of death. Early detection\\nof suspicious lung nodules is crucial for patient treatment planning,\\nmanagement, and improving outcomes. Many approaches for lung nodule\\nsegmentation and volumetric analysis have been proposed, but few have looked at\\nlongitudinal changes in total lung tumor burden. In this work, we trained two\\n3D models (nnUNet) with and without anatomical priors to automatically segment\\nlung lesions and quantified total lesion burden for each patient. The 3D model\\nwithout priors significantly outperformed ($p < .001$) the model trained with\\nanatomy priors. For detecting clinically significant lesions $>$ 1cm, a\\nprecision of 71.3\\\\%, sensitivity of 68.4\\\\%, and F1-score of 69.8\\\\% was\\nachieved. For segmentation, a Dice score of 77.1 $\\\\pm$ 20.3 and Hausdorff\\ndistance error of 11.7 $\\\\pm$ 24.1 mm was obtained. The median lesion burden was\\n6.4 cc (IQR: 2.1, 18.1) and the median volume difference between manual and\\nautomated measurements was 0.02 cc (IQR: -2.8, 1.2). Agreements were also\\nevaluated with linear regression and Bland-Altman plots. The proposed approach\\ncan produce a personalized evaluation of the total tumor burden for a patient\\nand facilitate interval change tracking over time.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:30:43Z\"}"}
