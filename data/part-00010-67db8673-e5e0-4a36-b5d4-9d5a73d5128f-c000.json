The dynamics\\nof these biological appendages have inspired the design of many types of\\nartificial microswimmers. The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion\\ndepends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in\\nturn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In\\nthis work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical\\n(bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using\\nmathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a\\nslender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the\\noptimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the\\ntime-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing\\na specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based\\nvariational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of\\nbending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff\\nnear the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that\\ndepends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure. These\\nfindings may guide the optimal design of future artificial swimmers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:28:32Z\"}"}
