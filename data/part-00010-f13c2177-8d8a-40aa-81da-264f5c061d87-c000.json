{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566v1\", \"title\": \"Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor\\n  Structure\", \"summary\": \"Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio\\noptimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and\\nsmall data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that\\nintegrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes,\\nbridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of\\nthe curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By\\nexploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we\\ndecompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using\\ntime-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated\\ninto the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical\\nguarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation\\nat O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4}\\nn^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather\\nthan the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the\\nclassical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable\\nfor markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior\\nperformance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical\\nanalysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in\\nconstructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work\\npresents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion\\nmodels, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial\\nsimulation with limited data.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.ST,cs.LG,q-fin.MF\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:01:35Z\"}"}
