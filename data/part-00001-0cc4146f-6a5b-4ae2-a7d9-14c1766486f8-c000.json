The differential production rate of\\n$K^+K^-$ is related to the self-energy of the $\\\\phi$ meson, incorporating the\\ncontributions of the quark loop at leading order and the kaon loop at\\nnext-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We numerically evaluate the\\ninvariant mass spectrum of the $K^+K^-$ pair both in vacuum and at finite\\ntemperature. The inclusion of the kaon loop results in a finite width of the\\nspectrum, improving agreement with experimental data. We also investigate the\\nspin alignment of the $\\\\phi$ meson induced by its motion relative to the\\nthermal background. In the NJL model with only chiral condensates, we find that\\ndeviations from the unpolarized limit of 1/3 are negligible.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:08:18Z\"}"}
