Given an undirected simple graph, our algorithm either\\nfinds a set of fewer than $k$ vertices whose removal disconnects the graph or\\nreports that no such set exists. The algorithm runs in $O(m \\\\cdot\\n\\\\text{poly}(k, \\\\log n))$ work and $O(\\\\text{poly}(k, \\\\log n))$ depth, which is\\nnearly optimal for any $k = \\\\text{poly}(\\\\log n)$. Prior to our work, algorithms\\nwith near-linear work and polylogarithmic depth were known only for $k=3$\\n[Miller, Ramachandran, STOC'87]; for $k=4$, sequential algorithms achieving\\nnear-linear time were known [Forster, Nanongkai, Yang, Saranurak,\\nYingchareonthawornchai, SODA'20], but no algorithm with near-linear work could\\nachieve even sublinear (on $n$) depth.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:35:38Z\"}"}
