{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23743v1\", \"title\": \"DUNE Software and Computing Research and Development\", \"summary\": \"The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep\\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility\\n(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy toward the implementation of this\\nleading-edge, large-scale science project. The ambitious physics program of\\nPhase I and Phase II of DUNE is dependent upon deployment and utilization of\\nsignificant computing resources, and successful research and development of\\nsoftware (both infrastructure and algorithmic) in order to achieve these\\nscientific goals. This submission discusses the computing resources\\nprojections, infrastructure support, and software development needed for DUNE\\nduring the coming decades as an input to the European Strategy for Particle\\nPhysics Update for 2026. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main\\ncontributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics\\nprocess. This submission to the 'Computing' stream focuses on DUNE software and\\ncomputing. Additional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector\\ntechnologies and R&D, and European contributions to Fermilab accelerator\\nupgrades and facilities for the DUNE experiment, are also being submitted to\\nother streams.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.data-an\", \"categories\": \"physics.data-an,hep-ex,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:47:08Z\"}"}
