{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06960v1\", \"title\": \"Higher-Order Color Voronoi Diagrams and the Colorful Clarkson-Shor\\n  Framework\", \"summary\": \"Given a set $S$ of $n$ colored sites, each $s\\\\in S$ associated with a\\ndistance-to-site function $\\\\delta_s \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$, we\\nconsider two distance-to-color functions for each color: one takes the minimum\\nof $\\\\delta_s$ for sites $s\\\\in S$ in that color and the other takes the maximum.\\nThese two sets of distance functions induce two families of higher-order\\nVoronoi diagrams for colors in the plane, namely, the minimal and maximal\\norder-$k$ color Voronoi diagrams, which include various well-studied Voronoi\\ndiagrams as special cases. In this paper, we derive an exact upper bound\\n$4k(n-k)-2n$ on the total number of vertices in both the minimal and maximal\\norder-$k$ color diagrams for a wide class of distance functions $\\\\delta_s$ that\\nsatisfy certain conditions, including the case of point sites $S$ under convex\\ndistance functions and the $L_p$ metric for any $1\\\\leq p \\\\leq\\\\infty$. For the\\n$L_1$ (or, $L_\\\\infty$) metric, and other convex polygonal metrics, we show that\\nthe order-$k$ minimal diagram of point sites has $O(\\\\min\\\\{k(n-k), (n-k)^2\\\\})$\\ncomplexity, while its maximal counterpart has $O(\\\\min\\\\{k(n-k), k^2\\\\})$\\ncomplexity. To obtain these combinatorial results, we extend the Clarkson--Shor\\nframework to colored objects, and demonstrate its application to several\\nfundamental geometric structures, including higher-order color Voronoi\\ndiagrams, colored $j$-facets, and levels in the arrangements of piecewise\\nlinear/algebraic curves/surfaces. We also present an iterative approach to\\ncompute higher-order color Voronoi diagrams.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:12:28Z\"}"}
