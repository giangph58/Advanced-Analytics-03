To address this challenge, this paper explores an intelligent\\ncontrol framework leveraging fuzzy logic, a foundational AI technique, to\\nsuppress oscillations in suspension systems. Inspired by learning based\\nmethodologies, the proposed approach utilizes fuzzy inference and Gaussian\\nmembership functions to emulate adaptive, human like decision making. By\\nminimizing the need for explicit mathematical models, the method demonstrates\\nrobustness in both linear and nonlinear systems. Experimental validation\\nhighlights the controllers ability to adapt to varying suspension lengths,\\nreducing oscillation amplitudes and improving stability under dynamic\\nconditions. This research bridges the gap between traditional control systems\\nand learning inspired techniques, offering a scalable, data efficient solution\\nfor modern transportation challenges\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:09:22Z\"}"}
