There has been an\\nincreasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene\\nexpression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image\\nfoundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream\\nanalysis, their performances on gene-expression prediction are still limited.\\nExplicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help\\nimage models to address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of\\nfoundation models can be expensive. In the work, we propose Parameter Efficient\\nKnowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine\\nAdaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses\\nfor cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression\\nprediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123\\nimage tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that encompassed various\\ntypes of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5\\\\% performance improvement over\\nbaseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We will release the code, datasets\\nand aligned models after peer-review to facilitate broader adoption and further\\ndevelopment for parameter efficient model alignment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:24:41Z\"}"}
