To address these issues, we propose a detail-aware multi-view stereo\\nnetwork (DA-MVSNet) with a coarse-to-fine framework. The geometric depth clues\\nhidden in the coarse stage are utilized to maintain the geometric structural\\nrelationships between object surfaces and enhance the expressive capability of\\nimage features. In addition, an image synthesis loss is employed to constrain\\nthe gradient flow for detailed regions and further strengthen the supervision\\nof object boundaries and texture-rich areas. Finally, we propose an adaptive\\ndepth interval adjustment strategy to improve the accuracy of object\\nreconstruction. Extensive experiments on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets\\ndemonstrate that our method achieves competitive results.
