However, generating time series of tabular\\ndata, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely\\nunexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly\\nsolving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular\\ndata (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable\\nlength of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers\\n(DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the\\nrecent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework\\nto deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive\\nexperiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms\\nprevious work by a large margin.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:56:09Z\"}"}
