{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06772v1\", \"title\": \"Towards Efficient Roadside LiDAR Deployment: A Fast Surrogate Metric\\n  Based on Entropy-Guided Visibility\", \"summary\": \"The deployment of roadside LiDAR sensors plays a crucial role in the\\ndevelopment of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). However, the\\nhigh cost of LiDAR sensors necessitates efficient placement strategies to\\nmaximize detection performance. Traditional roadside LiDAR deployment methods\\nrely on expert insight, making them time-consuming. Automating this process,\\nhowever, demands extensive computation, as it requires not only visibility\\nevaluation but also assessing detection performance across different LiDAR\\nplacements. To address this challenge, we propose a fast surrogate metric, the\\nEntropy-Guided Visibility Score (EGVS), based on information gain to evaluate\\nobject detection performance in roadside LiDAR configurations. EGVS leverages\\nTraffic Probabilistic Occupancy Grids (TPOG) to prioritize critical areas and\\nemploys entropy-based calculations to quantify the information captured by\\nLiDAR beams. This eliminates the need for direct detection performance\\nevaluation, which typically requires extensive labeling and computational\\nresources. By integrating EGVS into the optimization process, we significantly\\naccelerate the search for optimal LiDAR configurations. Experimental results\\nusing the AWSIM simulator demonstrate that EGVS strongly correlates with\\nAverage Precision (AP) scores and effectively predicts object detection\\nperformance. This approach offers a computationally efficient solution for\\nroadside LiDAR deployment, facilitating scalable smart infrastructure\\ndevelopment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:53:03Z\"}"}
