First, the reduction of $\\\\mathbf{k}$-points in the Brillouin zone can\\nreduce the number of Kohn-Sham equations to be solved. This necessitates the\\ncorrect implementation of the rotation relation between the density matrices of\\nequivalent $\\\\mathbf{k}$-points within the representation of atomic orbitals.\\nSecond, the reduction of the real-space sector can accelerate the construction\\nof the exact-exchange part of the Hamiltonian in real space. We have\\nimplemented this algorithm in the ABACUS software interfaced with LibRI, and\\ntested its performance for several types of crystal systems with different\\nsymmetries. The expected speed-up is achieved in both aspects: the time of\\nsolving the Kohn-Sham equations decreases in proportion with the reduction of\\n$\\\\mathbf{k}$-points, while the construction of the Hamiltonian in real space is\\nsped up by several times, with the degree of acceleration depending on the size\\nand symmetry of the system.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:23:32Z\"}"}
