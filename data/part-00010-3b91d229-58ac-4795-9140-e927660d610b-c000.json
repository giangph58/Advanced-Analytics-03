{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06215v1\", \"title\": \"Randomization Inference in Two-Sided Market Experiments\", \"summary\": \"Randomized experiments are increasingly employed in two-sided markets, such\\nas buyer-seller platforms, to evaluate treatment effects from marketplace\\ninterventions. These experiments must reflect the underlying two-sided market\\nstructure in their design (e.g., sellers and buyers), making them particularly\\nchallenging to analyze. In this paper, we propose a randomization inference\\nframework to analyze outcomes from such two-sided experiments. Our approach is\\nfinite-sample valid under sharp null hypotheses for any test statistic and\\nmaintains asymptotic validity under weak null hypotheses through\\nstudentization. Moreover, we provide heuristic guidance for choosing among\\nmultiple valid randomization tests to enhance statistical power, which we\\ndemonstrate empirically. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our\\nmethodology through a series of simulation studies.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:00:42Z\"}"}
