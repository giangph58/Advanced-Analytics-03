Notably, we find that the\\npotential for axion forces scales from $1/r^3$ in a vacuum-only context to\\n$1/r$ when the background effect is considered. Also, the magnitude of the\\naxion force is substantially amplified in proportion to the number density of\\naxion DM particles. These enhancements significantly improve the constraints on\\nthe axion decay constant by several orders of magnitude, across a broad range\\nof axion masses, based on the fifth-force experiments such as the Casimir-less\\nand torsion balance tests. This suggests that such experiments are more\\neffective than previously understood in detecting axions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:37:46Z\"}"}
