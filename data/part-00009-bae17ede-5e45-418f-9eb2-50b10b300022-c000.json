In biomedical research, scientific codebases can\\nlack scalability and are not easily transferable to work beyond what they were\\nintended. xML-workFlow addresses this issue by providing a rapid, robust, and\\ntraceable end-to-end workflow that can be adapted to any ML project with\\nminimal code rewriting.\\n  Results: We show a practical, end-to-end workflow that integrates\\nscikit-learn, MLflow, and SHAP. This template significantly reduces the time\\nand effort required to build and iterate on ML models, addressing the common\\nchallenges of scalability and reproducibility in biomedical research. Adapting\\nour template may save bioinformaticians time in development and enables\\nbiomedical researchers to deploy ML projects.\\n  Availability and implementation: xML-workFlow is available at\\nhttps://github.com/MedicalGenomicsLab/xML-workFlow.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:01:12Z\"}"}
