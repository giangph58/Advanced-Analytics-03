{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24381v1\", \"title\": \"UniOcc: A Unified Benchmark for Occupancy Forecasting and Prediction in\\n  Autonomous Driving\", \"summary\": \"We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark for occupancy\\nforecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical\\ninformation) and current-frame occupancy prediction from camera images. UniOcc\\nunifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and\\nhigh-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D\\noccupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative\\nautonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely\\non suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics\\nthat do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of\\nadditional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on\\nstate-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data\\nand explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and\\nforecasting performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.MA,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:59:24Z\"}"}
