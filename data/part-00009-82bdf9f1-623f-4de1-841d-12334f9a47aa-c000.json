While any such space is classically\\nisomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers, the\\ncomputable-isomorphism types of computably discrete represented spaces exhibit\\na rich structure. We show that the widely studied class of computably\\nenumerable equivalence relations (ceers) corresponds precisely to the\\ncomputably Quasi-Polish computably discrete spaces. We employ computably\\ndiscrete spaces to exhibit several separating examples in computable topology.\\nWe construct a computably discrete computably Quasi-Polish space admitting no\\ndecidable properties, a computably discrete and computably Hausdorff\\nprecomputably Quasi-Polish space admitting no computable injection into the\\nnatural numbers, a two-point space which is computably Hausdorff but not\\ncomputably discrete, and a two-point space which is computably discrete but not\\ncomputably Hausdorff. We further expand an example due to Weihrauch that\\nseparates computably regular spaces from computably normal spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,cs.LO,math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:36:11Z\"}"}
