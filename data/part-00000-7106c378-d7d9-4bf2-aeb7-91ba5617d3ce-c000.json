{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24338v1\", \"title\": \"Spontaneous Emission from Electronic Metastable Resonance States\", \"summary\": \"We demonstrate that calculating the spontaneous emission decay rate from\\nmetastable resonance states (states with finite lifetimes embedded in the\\ncontinuum) requires considering transitions to all continuum states, not just\\nto lower states. This holds even when the lifetimes of the metastable states\\nare very long and might be effectively considered as bound states in the\\ncontinuum. However, employing complex-scaling transformations, this\\ncomputationally prohibitive task becomes feasible by utilizing methods\\noriginally designed for excited bound states for calculation of complex poles\\nof the scattering matrix. As an illustrative example, these methods are applied\\nto calculate the spontaneous emission decay rates of metastable resonance\\nstates in a double-barrier potential. The rapid numerical convergence of this\\napproach highlights a new avenue for studying spontaneous emission from\\nmetastable states in real-life systems, particularly in many-electron systems,\\nwhere calculation of the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable\\nresonances (e.g., autoionization states) is computationally difficult, if not\\nimpossible, using the standard (Hermitian) formalism of quantum mechanics.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:24:32Z\"}"}
