Our algorithm outperforms previous work by polylog factors and\\nnearly saturates the known lower bound. We find an algorithm that uses\\n$O\\\\left(n \\\\log \\\\frac{d}{\\\\delta}\\\\right)$ to achieve precision\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\text{tr } \\\\Sigma}}{n}$ in $\\\\lVert \\\\rVert_\\\\infty$ norm and hence\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{d \\\\text{ tr } \\\\Sigma}}{n}$ in $\\\\lVert \\\\rVert_2$ norm, where $d$ is\\nthe dimension and $\\\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. We also presented another\\nalgorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\\\\frac{1}{4}$ in\\ncomplexity. The idea originates from the previous observations that the Grover\\ngate, when generalized to allow for arbitrary phases instead of $\\\\pm 1$,\\nbecomes a good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion. The only\\nremaining $\\\\log \\\\frac{d}{\\\\delta}$ as opposed to $\\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}$ is due\\nto the phase estimation primitive we employed, which so far is the only major\\nknown method to tackle the problem. Our results demonstrates that our\\nmethodology with generalized Grover gate can be used locate the optimal\\nalgorithm, without polylog overhead, for different taks relating to mean value\\nestimation.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:48:23Z\"}"}
