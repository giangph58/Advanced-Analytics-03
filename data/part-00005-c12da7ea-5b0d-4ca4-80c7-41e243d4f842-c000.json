Then, we show that single-trajectory mean-field methods\\ncompletely fail to capture electronic population transfer in the vicinity of\\nconical intersections between potential energy surfaces associated with\\nelectronic states of different symmetry (i.e., belonging to different\\nirreducible representations of the molecular point group). The underlying cause\\nof this limitation suggests that the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics can be\\nuseful for studying nonadiabatic dynamics close to conical intersections of\\nelectronic states of the same symmetry, which have been understudied owing to\\nthe difficulty in locating them. Using a model of this type of intersection, we\\ncompare the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics with exact quantum dynamics and\\nfind that the approximate mean-field approach yields a molecular wavefunction\\nthat remains qualitatively similar to the exact one even after crossing and\\nrecrossing the conical intersection.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:27:20Z\"}"}
