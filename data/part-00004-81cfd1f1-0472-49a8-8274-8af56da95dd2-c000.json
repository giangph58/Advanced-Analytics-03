A dataset of 116,066\\ntrajectories harvested from Mode S radar returns in UK airspace was used to\\ntrain and test the model. Thirteen aircraft types with varying performance\\ncharacteristics were investigated. It was found that the error in the mean\\nprediction of time to reach the bottom of descent for the proposed method was\\nless than that of the the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model by a factor of 10.\\nFurthermore, the method was capable of generating a range of trajectories that\\nwere similar to the held out test dataset when analysed in distribution. The\\nproposed method is hybrid, with aircraft drag and calibrated airspeed functions\\ngenerated probabilistically to parameterise the BADA equations, ensuring the\\nphysical plausibility of generated trajectories.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:33:48Z\"}"}
