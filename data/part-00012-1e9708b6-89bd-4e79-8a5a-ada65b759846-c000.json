This cut-off size is much smaller than the typical distance\\nto the nearest neighbour. In particular, for typical initial data, we show\\nconvergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the\\nVlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the\\nmaximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate\\nmean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the\\nVlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force\\nterm arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.\", \"main_category\": \"math-ph\", \"categories\": \"math-ph,math.DS,math.MP,physics.class-ph,G.3\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:24:18Z\"}"}
