Numerical estimates of the phase of gravitational\\nwaves are provided for typical mass transfer rates. Our result can be used to\\nimprove the waveforms of gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries with\\nmass transfer.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:49:57Z\"}"}
