The nonlinearities\\nhave been analyzed, and solitons have been studied. The theory is built using\\nthe quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model, incorporating the effects of Fermi\\npressure, quantum Bohm potential, and exchange-correlation potentials. The\\ndispersion relation for the coupling is established. A set of nonlinear\\nevolution equations has been derived using the two-time scale theory, and a\\nsoliton solution for the coupled nonlinear evolution equations is obtained\\nusing the modified quantum Zakharov equations. The solitons are found to have a\\ncusp profile. It is also found that the solitons' field amplitude increases\\nsignificantly with particle density and coupling strength in piezoelectric\\nsemiconductor quantum plasmas.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:24:38Z\"}"}
