{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23740v1\", \"title\": \"LANID: LLM-assisted New Intent Discovery\", \"summary\": \"Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TODS) often face the challenge of\\nencountering new intents. New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that\\naims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to\\nrecognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have\\nstruggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external\\nknowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their\\nscale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive\\nqueries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs,\\nwe propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of\\nlightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs\\nthe $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the\\ntraining set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between\\nthese pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a\\ncontrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with\\na contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy\\nof the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong\\nbaselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.
