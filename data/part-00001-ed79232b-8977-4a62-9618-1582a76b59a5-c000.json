{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01721v1\", \"title\": \"An Adaptive Proximal Inexact Gradient Framework and Its Application to\\n  Per-Antenna Constrained Joint Beamforming and Compression Design\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose an adaptive proximal inexact gradient (APIG)\\nframework for solving a class of nonsmooth composite optimization problems\\ninvolving function and gradient errors. Unlike existing inexact proximal\\ngradient methods, the proposed framework introduces a new line search condition\\nthat jointly adapts to function and gradient errors, enabling adaptive stepsize\\nselection while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that\\nthe proposed framework achieves an $\\\\epsilon$-stationary point within\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations for nonconvex objectives and an\\n$\\\\epsilon$-optimal solution within $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations for\\nconvex cases, matching the best-known complexity in this context. We then\\ncustom-apply the APIG framework to an important signal processing problem: the\\njoint beamforming and compression problem (JBCP) with per-antenna power\\nconstraints (PAPCs) in cooperative cellular networks. This customized\\napplication requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure\\nsuch as the tightness of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the\\ndifferentiability of the dual. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior\\nperformance of our custom-application over state-of-the-art benchmarks for the\\nJBCP.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:28:15Z\"}"}
