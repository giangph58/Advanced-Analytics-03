{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02645v1\", \"title\": \"Black Holes, Moduli Stabilisation and the Swampland\", \"summary\": \"In theories with moduli, extremal black holes behave such that for generic\\ninitial conditions, the distance traveled by the scalars from infinity to the\\nhorizon can grow with the size of the black hole. This, in turn, implies that\\nlarger black holes can probe more of the UV ingredients of the theory, in\\ncontrast with (naive) EFT expectations. We relate this discrepancy to the lack\\nof cosmological moduli stabilisation. Indeed, for would-be scale-separated\\nstring vacua with parametrically heavy stabilised scalars -- dubbed\\n\\\\emph{rigid} compactifications -- one recovers the EFT intuition where only\\nsmall black holes probe the UV. We make this explicit in a toy model and then\\nturn to top-down models and construct near-horizon solutions in IIA\\nscale-separated compactifications with stabilised moduli. In these top-down\\nmodels we still observe large field variations for large black holes which can\\nbe traced back to the absence of parametrically heavy moduli. We are led to\\nspeculate that needing UV physics to allow for non-local effects near the\\nhorizon of large black holes is at odds with having a rigid compactification,\\nhinting to the possibility that such compactifications are in the Swampland.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:38:46Z\"}"}
