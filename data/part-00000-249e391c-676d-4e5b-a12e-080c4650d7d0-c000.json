{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23984v1\", \"title\": \"Two-wheel-driven Electric Superbike Powertrain Optimization\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the powertrain design\\nof a two-wheel-driven electric superbike, minimizing energy consumption.\\nSpecifically, we jointly optimize the force distribution between the wheels\\nwith the gear ratio, and rear motor and battery sizing while explicitly\\nconsidering vehicle dynamics and performance constraints. First, we present an\\nenergy consumption model of the vehicle, including a scalable model of the\\nelectric machine based on data from the industry, accounting for iron, copper,\\nand mechanical losses. Then, we analyze the propulsive blending strategy to\\ndistribute the required power to the wheels while considering adherence limits.\\nFinally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing the\\ndesign of a superbike, based on regulatory driving cycles and a custom\\nhigh-performance circuit by comparing the force distribution approaches. The\\nresults underline the significance of joint optimization of powertrain\\ncomponents and propulsive bias, achieving a reduction of up to 22.36% in energy\\nconsumption for the Sport high-performance driving cycle.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,J.6\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:54:50Z\"}"}
