Here we study a quantum system which consists\\nof a coupled electron-moun spin state, i.e., muonium, a light isotope of\\nhydrogen. We demonstrate the most fundamental coherent control techniques by\\nmicrowave excitation of spin transitions, namely driven Rabi oscillations and\\nRamsey fringes upon free evolution. Unprecedented performance is achieved by\\nthe microwave hardware devised for these experiments, which enables coherent\\nspin manipulation of individual, isolated, muonium centers. For muonium formed\\nin SiO$_2$ with strong electron-muon hyperfine interaction, a virtually\\nundamped free precession signal is observed up to a 3.5 $\\\\mu$s time window. For\\nmuonium formed in Si with weak and anisotropic hyperfine interaction, a strong\\ndrive at the multi-quantum transition decouples the muonium center from its\\nmagnetic environment formed by the bath of $^{29}$Si nuclear spins at natural\\nabundance. We expect that these capabilities will provide a powerful tool to\\ninvestigate the effect of the environment on isolated coupled spins, uncover\\nthe details of coupled electron-muon systems in matter and validate quantum\\nelectrodynamics in the context of muonium spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:50:05Z\"}"}
