In this work, we propose and analyze\\na Measurement Device Independent (MDI) protocol designed to distribute keys\\namong three users in a pairwise manner. Each user randomly selects a basis,\\nencodes bit values in the phase of coherent states, and sends the resulting\\npulses to a central measurement unit (MU) composed of three beam splitters and\\nthree photon detectors. When the three pulses arrive simultaneously at the MU\\nand under the condition of successful detection of photons, a key bit is\\ndistributed to at least one pair of users. This protocol extends the\\nfoundational phase-encoding MDI protocol introduced by [K. Tamaki, et al.,\\nPhys. Rev. A 85, 042307 (2012)] to three users, but this comes at the cost of\\nintroducing a systematic error in the implementation of the honest protocol.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:01:49Z\"}"}
