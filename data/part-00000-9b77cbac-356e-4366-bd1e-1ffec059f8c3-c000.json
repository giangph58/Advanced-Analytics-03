{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24106v1\", \"title\": \"Computing and software for LHCb Upgrade II\", \"summary\": \"A second major upgrade of the LHCb experiment is necessary to allow full\\nexploitation of the High Luminosity LHC for flavour physics. The new experiment\\nwill operate in Run 5 of the LHC at a luminosity up to $1.5\\\\times\\n10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. The experiment will therefore experience extremely high\\nparticle fluences and data rates, posing a high challenge not only for the\\ndetector but also for the software and computing resources needed to readout,\\nreconstruct, select and analyse the data. This document presents these\\nchallenges and the ongoing and future R&D programme necessary to address them.\\nThis programme will benefit not only the LHCb Upgrade II experiment, but the\\nwhole particle physics community as similar challenges will be faced by the\\nnext generation of experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:57:27Z\"}"}
