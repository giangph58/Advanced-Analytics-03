{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07920v1\", \"title\": \"Directed Temporal Tree Realization for Periodic Public Transport: Easy\\n  and Hard Cases\", \"summary\": \"We study the complexity of the directed periodic temporal graph realization\\nproblem. This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public\\ntransport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that\\nthe fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a\\nspecified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While\\nprevious work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the\\napplication in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to\\nassign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem\\ninstance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least\\nshortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path\\ndistances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we\\nintroduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the\\nmaximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies\\nand provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to\\nthe period $\\\\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter~$k$, showing a sharp\\nthreshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We\\nalso provide hardness results for the special case of period $\\\\Delta = 2$ for\\ngeneral directed and undirected graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.CC,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:36:23Z\"}"}
