We study the rower model to uncover how cilia activity and\\ndissipation enable this precise motion. In this model, cilia motion is\\nrepresented by a micro-beads Brownian movement between two distant harmonic\\npotentials. At specific locations, energy pumps trigger potential switches,\\ncapturing cilia activity and generating oscillations. We quantify precision of\\noscillation using a quality factor, identifying its scaling with activity and\\noscillation amplitude, finding precision maximization at an optimal amplitude.\\nThe data collapse is not accurate for noisy oscillations. An exact analytic\\nexpression for the precision quality factor, based on first passage time\\nfluctuations, and derived in the small noise approximation, explains its\\noptimality and scaling. Energy budget analysis shows the quality factor's\\nconsistency with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:09:46Z\"}"}
