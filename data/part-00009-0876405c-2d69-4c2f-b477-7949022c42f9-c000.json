Using this\\nresult, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular\\nHamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea\\nto derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss\\nthe difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability\\nof the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an\\nanalog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:34:59Z\"}"}
