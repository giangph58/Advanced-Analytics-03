Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising\\nalternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known\\nto exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited\\nrepresentation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be\\ncarefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to\\nsynthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a\\nreal sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates\\nsynthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised\\nhistorical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to\\nsynthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite\\nmeasuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the\\ngroup (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional \\\"individual\\\" level.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on\\nthe alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an\\ninitial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and\\ncompare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications,\\nlimitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:41:51Z\"}"}
