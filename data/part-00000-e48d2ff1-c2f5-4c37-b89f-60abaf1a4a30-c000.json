{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24037v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Nudges Using Emotion Regulation to Reduce Online Disinformation\\n  Sharing\", \"summary\": \"Online disinformation often provokes strong anger, driving social media users\\nto spread it; however, few measures specifically target sharing behaviors\\ndriven by this emotion to curb the spread of disinformation. This study aimed\\nto evaluate whether digital nudges that encourage deliberation by drawing\\nattention to emotional information can reduce sharing driven by strong anger\\nassociated with online disinformation. We focused on emotion regulation, as a\\nmethod for fostering deliberation, which is activated when individuals'\\nattention is drawn to their current emotions. Digital nudges were designed to\\ndisplay emotional information about disinformation and emotion regulation\\nmessages. Among these, we found that distraction and perspective-taking nudges\\nmay encourage deliberation in anger-driven sharing. To assess their\\neffectiveness, existing nudges mimicking platform functions were used for\\ncomparison. Participant responses were measured across four dimensions: sharing\\nintentions, type of emotion, intensity of emotion, and authenticity. The\\nresults showed that all digital nudges significantly reduced the sharing of\\ndisinformation, with distraction nudges being the most effective. These\\nfindings suggest that digital nudges addressing emotional responses can serve\\nas an effective intervention against the spread disinformation driven by strong\\nanger.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CR,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:01:05Z\"}"}
