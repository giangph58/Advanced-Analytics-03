{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01641v1\", \"title\": \"Bridge 2D-3D: Uncertainty-aware Hierarchical Registration Network with\\n  Domain Alignment\", \"summary\": \"The method for image-to-point cloud registration typically determines the\\nrigid transformation using a coarse-to-fine pipeline. However, directly and\\nuniformly matching image patches with point cloud patches may lead to focusing\\non incorrect noise patches during matching while ignoring key ones. Moreover,\\ndue to the significant differences between image and point cloud modalities, it\\nmay be challenging to bridge the domain gap without specific improvements in\\ndesign. To address the above issues, we innovatively propose the\\nUncertainty-aware Hierarchical Matching Module (UHMM) and the Adversarial Modal\\nAlignment Module (AMAM). Within the UHMM, we model the uncertainty of critical\\ninformation in image patches and facilitate multi-level fusion interactions\\nbetween image and point cloud features. In the AMAM, we design an adversarial\\napproach to reduce the domain gap between image and point cloud. Extensive\\nexperiments and ablation studies on RGB-D Scene V2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks\\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method, making it a state-of-the-art\\napproach for image-to-point cloud registration tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:43:55Z\"}"}
