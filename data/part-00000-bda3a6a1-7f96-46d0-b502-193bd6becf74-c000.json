The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning\\nprocess to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the\\nvisible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables\\nthe generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage\\nplanning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control\\nproblem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive\\nreal-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed\\napproach.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:23:37Z\"}"}
