{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900v1\", \"title\": \"Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline\\n  states in open systems\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against\\nthermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of\\nthe period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and\\ndiscrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity\\nsystem, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for\\nprecise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred\\nintermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We\\ndemonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the\\ndriving frequency.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:19:55Z\"}"}
