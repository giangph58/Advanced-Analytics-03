Photometry\\n  Pipeline\", \"summary\": \"To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small\\nangular Einstein radius $\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{E}$, we build a new full-frame\\ndifference image for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey\\nbased on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes\\nof the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis,\\nand light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract the light curves\\nfor 483,068 stars with $I \\\\lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search\\nfor microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including\\nfive new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by\\nprevious KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline\\nare precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{E} \\\\sim\\n1~\\\\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year\\nKMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass\\nfunction. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system,\\nwith significantly reduced false positives.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:50:38Z\"}"}
