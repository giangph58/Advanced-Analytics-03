Wilf's inequality provides a spectral bound for the clique\\nnumber of simple graphs. Wilf's inequality is stated as follows: $\\\\frac{n}{n -\\n\\\\lambda_{1}} \\\\leq \\\\omega$, where $\\\\lambda_1$ is the largest eigenvalue of the\\nadjacency matrix $A(G)$, $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$, and $\\\\omega$ is\\nthe clique number of $G$. Strengthening this bound, Elphick and Wocjan proposed\\na conjecture in 2018, which is stated as follows: $\\\\frac{n}{n - \\\\sqrt{s^{+}}}\\n\\\\leq \\\\omega$, where $s^+ = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda_{i} > 0} \\\\lambda_{i}^2$ and\\n$\\\\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A(G)$. In this paper, we have settled this\\nconjecture for some classes of graphs, such as conference graphs, strongly\\nregular graphs with $\\\\lambda = \\\\mu$ (i.e., $srg(n, d, \\\\mu, \\\\mu)$) and $n\\\\geq\\n2d$, the line graph of $K_{n}$, the Cartesian product of strongly regular\\ngraphs, and Ramanujan graph with $n\\\\geq 11d$.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DM\", \"categories\": \"cs.DM,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:46:55Z\"}"}
