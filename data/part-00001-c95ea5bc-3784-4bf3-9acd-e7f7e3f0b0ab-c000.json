{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04828v1\", \"title\": \"Enumeration on polyominoes determined by Catalan words avoiding\\n  $(\\\\geq,\\\\geq)$\", \"summary\": \"A Catalan word of length $n$ that avoids the pattern $(\\\\geq, \\\\geq)$ is a\\nsequence $w=w_1\\\\cdots w_n$ with $w_1=0$ and $0\\\\leq w_i\\\\leq w_{i-1}+1$ for all\\n$i$, while ensuring that no subsequence satisfies $w_i \\\\geq w_{i+1}\\\\geq\\nw_{i+2}$ for $i=2,\\\\ldots,n$. These words are enumerated by the $n$-th Motzkin\\nnumber. From such a word, we associate a $n$-column Motzkin polyomino (called a\\n$(\\\\geq,\\\\geq)$-polyomino), where the $i$-th column contains $w_i+1$\\nbottom-aligned cells. In this paper, we derive generating functions for\\n$(\\\\geq,\\\\geq)$-polyominoes based on their length, area, semiperimeter, last\\nsymbol value, and number of interior points. We provide asymptotic analyses and\\nclosed-form expressions for the total area, total semiperimeter, sum of the\\nlast symbol values, and total number of interior points across all\\n$(\\\\geq,\\\\geq)$-polyominoes of a given length. Finally, we express all these\\nresults as linear combinations of trinomial coefficients.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:36:14Z\"}"}
