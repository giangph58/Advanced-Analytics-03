Unless time dependence is present\\nfrom the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce\\nnon-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that\\nwhich also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the\\nHamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing\\nliterature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent\\nlight-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so\\nit does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys.\\nRev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while\\nreaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev.
