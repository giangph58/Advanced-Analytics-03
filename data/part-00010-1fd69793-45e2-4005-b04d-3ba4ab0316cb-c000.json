{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02299v1\", \"title\": \"Asymmetric graph alignment and the phase transition for asymmetric tree\\n  correlation testing\", \"summary\": \"Graph alignment - identifying node correspondences between two graphs - is a\\nfundamental problem with applications in network analysis, biology, and privacy\\nresearch. While substantial progress has been made in aligning correlated\\nErd\\\\H{o}s-R\\\\'enyi graphs under symmetric settings, real-world networks often\\nexhibit asymmetry in both node numbers and edge densities. In this work, we\\nintroduce a novel framework for asymmetric correlated Erd\\\\H{o}s-R\\\\'enyi graphs,\\ngeneralizing existing models to account for these asymmetries. We conduct a\\nrigorous theoretical analysis of graph alignment in the sparse regime, where\\nlocal neighborhoods exhibit tree-like structures. Our approach leverages tree\\ncorrelation testing as the central tool in our polynomial-time algorithm,\\nMPAlign, which achieves one-sided partial alignment under certain conditions.\\n  A key contribution of our work is characterizing these conditions under which\\nasymmetric tree correlation testing is feasible: If two correlated graphs $G$\\nand $G'$ have average degrees $\\\\lambda s$ and $\\\\lambda s'$ respectively, where\\n$\\\\lambda$ is their common density and $s,s'$ are marginal correlation\\nparameters, their tree neighborhoods can be aligned if $ss' > \\\\alpha$, where\\n$\\\\alpha$ denotes Otter's constant and $\\\\lambda$ is supposed large enough. The\\nfeasibility of this tree comparison problem undergoes a sharp phase transition\\nsince $ss' \\\\leq \\\\alpha$ implies its impossibility. These new results on tree\\ncorrelation testing allow us to solve a class of random subgraph isomorphism\\nproblems, resolving an open problem in the field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,cs.DS,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T06:10:00Z\"}"}
