{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05834v1\", \"title\": \"Elongation-Induced Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic\\n  Channels\", \"summary\": \"We numerically investigate the motion of elongated microparticles in\\nmicrofluidic channels at low Reynolds numbers. In channels with smooth walls,\\nasymmetric initial conditions -- including particle orientation and lateral\\nposition -- lead to continuous variations in particle trajectories, potentially\\nexhibiting repeated behavior depending on the channel geometry and initial\\nconditions. However, we find that introducing periodically textured walls\\ninduces alignment of the particle with the channel centerline within a specific\\nrange of texture wavelengths. This occurs as the textured pattern disrupts the\\nuniformity of the flow, creating localized high-velocity nodes that repeatedly\\nguide the particle toward the centerline as it moves downstream. Notably, the\\ncharacteristic length scale over which this alignment forms reduces with\\nincreasing particle elongation and diverges with increasing Reynolds number.\\nOur findings reveal that elongation-induced alignment can be leveraged for\\nmicrofluidic filtering applications, enabling the efficient separation of\\nmicroparticles based on their geometric properties. This work opens new avenues\\nfor designing microfluidic devices tailored for high-precision particle\\nsorting, with broad implications for biomedical and industrial applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cond-mat.stat-mech,physics.comp-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:17:23Z\"}"}
