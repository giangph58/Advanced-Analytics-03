Regularized regression techniques,\\nsuch as lasso, are widely employed to enhance interpretability by reducing\\nmodel complexity and identifying significant variables. However, when applying\\nto biomedical datasets, e.g., immunophenotyping dataset, there are two major\\nchallenges that may lead to unsatisfactory results using these methods: 1) high\\ncorrelation between predictors, which leads to the exclusion of important\\nvariables with included predictors in variable selection, and 2) the presence\\nof skewness, which violates key statistical assumptions of these methods.\\nCurrent approaches that fail to address these issues simultaneously may lead to\\nbiased interpretations and unreliable coefficient estimates. To overcome these\\nlimitations, we propose a novel two-step approach, the Bootstrap-Enhanced\\nRegularization Method (BERM). BERM outperforms existing two-step approaches and\\ndemonstrates consistent performance in terms of variable selection and\\nestimation accuracy across simulated sparsity scenarios. We further demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of BERM by applying it to a human immunophenotyping dataset\\nidentifying important immune parameters associated the autoimmune disease, type\\n1 diabetes.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:10:42Z\"}"}
