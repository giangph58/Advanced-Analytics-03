This\\ninitial step is required to assess the presence of detailed balance, and to\\ncompute the entropy production rate, which is, otherwise, ambiguously defined.\\nIn this work we deal with stochastic processes whose underlying time-reversal\\nsymmetry cannot be reduced to the usual parity rules (namely, flip of the\\nmomentum sign). We provide a systematic method to build equilibrium Langevin\\ndynamics starting from their reversible deterministic counterparts: this\\nstrategy can be applied, in particular, to all stable one-dimensional\\nHamiltonian dynamics, exploiting the time-reversal symmetry unveiled in the\\naction-angle framework. The case of the Lotka-Volterra model is discussed as an\\nexample. We also show that other stochastic versions of this system violate\\ntime-reversal symmetry and are, therefore, intrinsically out of equilibrium.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:36:30Z\"}"}
