Our simulations reproduce observed $M_{\\\\rm\\nstar}$-SFR relations and $\\\\delta$ at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster\\n(PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar $M_{\\\\rm star}$-SFR\\nrelations, with PC galaxies extending to higher $M_{\\\\rm star}$ and SFR. (2)\\nUV-bright PC galaxies ($M_{\\\\rm UV}\\\\lesssim -20$~mag) have $>2$ mag higher UV\\nattenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) $\\\\delta$ increases\\nwith redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., $\\\\delta\\\\sim50$ at\\n$z=14$ to $\\\\delta\\\\sim3$ at $z=6$ for a search volume of $\\\\sim3000$~cMpc$^3$ and\\na limiting magnitude of $M_{\\\\rm UV}=-17$~mag). These results indicate that\\nenhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not\\nanomalously high specific SFR. While simulated $\\\\delta$ agrees with observed PC\\ncandidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable\\n$\\\\delta$. We propose a robust PC identification method using both $\\\\delta$ and\\n$M_{\\\\rm star}$ of the most massive member. Critical $M_{\\\\rm star}$ thresholds\\nfor Coma progenitors are estimated ($10^{7.1}$ to $10^{10.2}$ M$_\\\\odot$ from\\n$z=14$ to 6). Comparison with JWST observations suggests GS-z14-0 and GS-z14-1,\\nthe current highest redshift holders, are likely progenitors of Coma-type\\nclusters.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:20:49Z\"}"}
