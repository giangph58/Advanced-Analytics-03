{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07450v1\", \"title\": \"Synthetic CT Generation from Time-of-Flight Non-Attenutaion-Corrected\\n  PET for Whole-Body PET Attenuation Correction\", \"summary\": \"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging requires accurate attenuation\\ncorrection (AC) to account for photon loss due to tissue density variations. In\\nPET/MR systems, computed tomography (CT), which offers a straightforward\\nestimation of AC is not available. This study presents a deep learning approach\\nto generate synthetic CT (sCT) images directly from Time-of-Flight (TOF)\\nnon-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images, enhancing AC for PET/MR. We first\\nevaluated models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets for a\\nCT-to-CT reconstruction task, finding that the pre-trained model outperformed\\nthose trained solely on medical datasets. The pre-trained model was then\\nfine-tuned using an institutional dataset of 35 TOF NAC PET and CT volume\\npairs, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 74.49 HU and highest\\npeak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.66 dB within the body contour region.\\nVisual assessments demonstrated improved reconstruction of both bone and soft\\ntissue structures from TOF NAC PET images. This work highlights the\\neffectiveness of using pre-trained deep learning models for medical image\\ntranslation tasks. Future work will assess the impact of sCT on PET attenuation\\ncorrection and explore additional neural network architectures and datasets to\\nfurther enhance performance and practical applications in PET imaging.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:49:41Z\"}"}
