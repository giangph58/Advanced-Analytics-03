{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07739v1\", \"title\": \"Implicit Incompressible Porous Flow using SPH\", \"summary\": \"We present a novel implicit porous flow solver using SPH, which maintains\\nfluid incompressibility and is able to model a wide range of scenarios, driven\\nby strongly coupled solid-fluid interaction forces. Many previous SPH porous\\nflow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid\\ninterface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid\\nand solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows\\nus to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account\\nand results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can\\nsimulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid\\nand solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit\\nforces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces. These\\nwe solve as a linear system and strongly couple with fluid viscosity and solid\\nelasticity. We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely\\ndrag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic\\nbehavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening,\\nwe propose an extension to the elasticity model. We demonstrate the efficacy of\\nour model with various simulations that showcase the different aspects of\\nporous flow behavior. To summarize, our system of strongly coupled non-pressure\\nforces and enforced incompressibility across overlapping phases allows us to\\nnaturally model and stably simulate complex porous interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR,physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:30:22Z\"}"}
