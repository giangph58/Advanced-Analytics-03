In these studies, we aimed to synthesize single crystals\\nof the potentially topological semimetallic compound EuAgP, which up to this\\nday has only been obtained in polycrystalline form. The flux method was\\nemployed for the syntheses, using fluxes such as: Bi, Sn, Pb, and In, in their\\nvarious ratios. The purpose of using Bi flux was to try synthesizing an analog\\nof EuAgAs single crystals, by fully substituting arsenic with phosphorus. The\\nobtained crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron\\nmicroscopy. Despite many unsuccessful attempts to synthesize EuAgP single\\ncrystals, the study provides valuable insights into how different fluxes and\\ntheir ratios influence the final synthesis product. It also underscores the\\ncomplexity of designing analogs between arsenides and phosphides.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:10:04Z\"}"}
