However, a\\ndetailed numerical description remains challenging, even for simple toy models.\\nAs a consequence, previous numerical simulations for large systems were largely\\nlimited to $T=0$. To provide guidance for cold-atom experiments, numerical\\ncalculations at finite temperature are required. Here, we numerically study the\\nreal-time properties of a single mobile hole in the 2D $t$-$J$ model at finite\\ntemperature and draw a comparison to features observed at $T=0$. We find that a\\nthree-stage process of hole motion, which was reported at $T=0$, is valid even\\nat finite temperature. However, already at low temperatures, the average hole\\nvelocity at long times is not simply proportional to the spin coupling,\\ncontrary to the $T=0$ behavior. Comparing our finite-temperature numerical\\nresults with the experimental data from quantum gas microscopy we find a\\nqualitative disagreement: in experiment, hole spreading speeds up with\\nincreasing $J/t$, while in our numerics it slows down. The latter is consistent\\nwith the numerical findings previously reported at $T=0$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:08:51Z\"}"}
