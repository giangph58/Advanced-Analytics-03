Existing search-based methods\\nmight lose critical signals during behavior selection. To overcome these\\nlimitations, we propose CHIME: A Compressive Framework for Holistic Interest\\nModeling. It uses adapted large language models to encode complete user\\nbehaviors with heterogeneous inputs. We introduce multi-granular contrastive\\nlearning objectives to capture both persistent and transient interest patterns\\nand apply residual vector quantization to generate compact embeddings. CHIME\\ndemonstrates superior ranking performance across diverse datasets, establishing\\na robust solution for scalable holistic interest modeling in recommendation\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:08:49Z\"}"}
