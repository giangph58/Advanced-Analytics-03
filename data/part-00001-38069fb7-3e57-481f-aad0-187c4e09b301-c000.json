Although such experimental methods exist,\\nthey generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the\\nelectron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density\\nof modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using\\ntwo-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a\\nprocess-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy\\nmeasurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works,\\nwe also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the\\nnon-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of\\nthe simulated signal.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:53:56Z\"}"}
