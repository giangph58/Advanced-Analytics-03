The vast design space of CGRA implementations poses a\\nchallenge, which calls for fast exploration tools to prune it in advance of\\ntime-consuming syntheses. The proposed tool aims to simplify this process by\\nsimulating kernel execution and providing a characterization framework. The\\nestimator returns energy and latency values otherwise only available through a\\ntime-consuming post-synthesis simulation, allowing for instantaneous\\ncomparative analysis between different kernels and hardware configurations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:21:09Z\"}"}
