{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01902v1\", \"title\": \"Graphically Speaking: Unmasking Abuse in Social Media with Conversation\\n  Insights\", \"summary\": \"Detecting abusive language in social media conversations poses significant\\nchallenges, as identifying abusiveness often depends on the conversational\\ncontext, characterized by the content and topology of preceding comments.\\nTraditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this\\ncontext, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural\\nLanguage Processing (NLP) methods that integrate conversational context often\\ndepend on limited and simplified representations, and report inconsistent\\nresults. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural\\nnetworks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes\\nrepresent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically\\ninvestigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the\\noptimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic\\nbaselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements\\nin F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured\\nconversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing\\ncontext-aware abusive language detection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:03:37Z\"}"}
