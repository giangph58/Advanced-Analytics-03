In an attempt to study their ``motivic theory'', two objects of\\nsemilinear algebra are attached to an Anderson module: its motive and its dual\\nmotive. While the former is better suited to follow the analogy with\\nGrothendieck motives, the latter has proven much useful in the study of\\ntranscendence questions in positive characteristic. Despite sharing similar\\ndefinitions, the relationship between motives and dual motives has remained\\nnebulous. Over perfect fields, it was only proved recently by the second author\\nthat the finite generation of the motive is equivalent to the finite generation\\nof the dual motive, answering a long-standing open question in function field\\narithmetic (the ``abelian equals $A$-finite'' theorem). This work constructs a\\nperfect pairing among the motive and the dual motive of an Anderson module,\\nwith values in a module of differentials, thus answering a question raised by\\nHartl and Juschka. Our construction involves taking the residue of certain\\nformal power series in the Frobenius endomorphism. Although it may seem\\npeculiar, this pairing is natural and compatible with base change. It also\\ncomes with several new consequences in function field arithmetic; for example,\\nwe generalize the ``abelian equals A-finite'' theorem to a large class of\\nalgebras, including fields, perfect algebras and noetherian regular domains.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T17:37:05Z\"}"}
