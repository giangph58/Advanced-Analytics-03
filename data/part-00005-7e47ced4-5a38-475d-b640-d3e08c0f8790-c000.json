{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05060v1\", \"title\": \"Universal scaling laws of boundary-driven turbulence\", \"summary\": \"Turbulence is a fundamental flow phenomenon, typically anisotropic at large\\nscales and approximately isotropic at small scales. The classical Kolmogorov\\nscaling laws (2/3, -5/3 and 4/5) have been well-established for turbulence\\nwithout small-scale body forcing, describing second-order velocity structure\\nfunctions, energy spectra, and third-order velocity structure functions in an\\nintermediate small-scale range. However, their validity boundary remains\\nunclear. Here, we identify new 1 and -2 scaling laws (replacing 2/3 and -5/3\\nlaws) alongside the unchanged 4/5 law in the core region of boundary-driven\\nturbulence, where energy is injected solely through viscous friction at moving\\nboundaries. Local isotropy is recovered after high-pass filtering. Notably,\\nodd-order velocity structure functions with and without absolute value exhibit\\ndistinct scaling exponents. A characteristic speed in the inertial range,\\nderived from the constant ratio of third- to second-order structure functions,\\nquantifies the time-averaged projectile speed at the bulk interface. Based on\\nenergy dissipation rate and the characteristic speed, a phenomenological\\nframework for structure functions is developed together with a model for\\nprobability distributions of velocity increment at distinct small-scales. The\\nuniversal scaling laws formulated can produce the full set of scaling exponents\\nfor low- and high-order velocity structure functions, including both the\\nodd-orders' with and without absolute value, which are validated by direct\\nnumerical simulations and experimental datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:33:23Z\"}"}
