{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07049v1\", \"title\": \"Harnessing non-equilibrium forces to optimize work extraction\", \"summary\": \"While optimal control theory offers effective strategies for minimizing\\nenergetic costs in noisy microscopic systems over finite durations, a\\nsignificant opportunity lies in exploiting the temporal structure of\\nnon-equilibrium forces. We demonstrate this by presenting exact analytical\\nforms for the optimal protocol and the corresponding work for any driving force\\nand protocol duration. We also derive a general quasistatic bound on the work,\\nrelying only on the coarse-grained, time-integrated characteristics of the\\napplied forces. Notably, we show that the optimal protocols often automatically\\nact as information engines that harness information about non-equilibrium\\nforces and an initial state measurement to extract work. These findings chart\\nnew directions for designing adaptive, energy-efficient strategies in noisy,\\ntime-dependent environments, as illustrated through our examples of periodic\\ndriving forces and active matter systems. By exploiting the temporal structure\\nof non-equilibrium forces, this largely unexplored approach holds promise for\\nsubstantial performance gains in microscopic devices operating at the nano- and\\nmicroscale.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:06:15Z\"}"}
