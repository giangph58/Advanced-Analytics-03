{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06551v1\", \"title\": \"Bridging Queries and Tables through Entities in Table Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"Table retrieval is essential for accessing information stored in structured\\ntabular formats; however, it remains less explored than text retrieval. The\\ncontent of the table primarily consists of phrases and words, which include a\\nlarge number of entities, such as time, locations, persons, and organizations.\\nEntities are well-studied in the context of text retrieval, but there is a\\nnoticeable lack of research on their applications in table retrieval. In this\\nwork, we explore how to leverage entities in tables to improve retrieval\\nperformance. First, we investigate the important role of entities in table\\nretrieval from a statistical perspective and propose an entity-enhanced\\ntraining framework. Subsequently, we use the type of entities to highlight\\nentities instead of introducing an external knowledge base. Moreover, we design\\nan interaction paradigm based on entity representations. Our proposed framework\\nis plug-and-play and flexible, making it easy to integrate into existing table\\nretriever training processes. Empirical results on two table retrieval\\nbenchmarks, NQ-TABLES and OTT-QA, show that our proposed framework is both\\nsimple and effective in enhancing existing retrievers. We also conduct\\nextensive analyses to confirm the efficacy of different components. Overall,\\nour work provides a promising direction for elevating table retrieval,\\nenlightening future research in this area.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:16:33Z\"}"}
