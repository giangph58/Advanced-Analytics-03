There is a natural greedy algorithm for constructing a base of\\nrelatively small size. We write $\\\\mathcal{G}(G)$ the maximum size of a base it\\nproduces, and $b(G)$ for the size of the smallest base for $G$. In 1999, Peter\\nCameron conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that every\\nfinite primitive group $G$ satisfies $\\\\mathcal{G}(G)\\\\leq cb(G)$. We show that\\nif $G$ is $\\\\mathrm{S}_n$ or $\\\\mathrm{A}_n$ acting primitively then either\\nCameron's Greedy Conjecture holds for $G$, or $G$ falls into one class of\\npossible exceptions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:27:03Z\"}"}
