For this aim, we rely on projection-based model\\norder reduction (MOR), i.e., we approximate the large-scale problem by\\nprojecting it onto a suitable subspace and reducing it to one of a much smaller\\ndimension. Such a subspace is constructed by means of weak greedy-type\\nstrategies. After detailing the connections with the reduced basis method for\\nsource problems, we introduce a novel error estimate for the approximation\\nerror related to the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since\\nthe difference between the second smallest and the smallest eigenvalue, the\\nso-called spectral gap, is crucial for the reliability of the error estimate,\\nwe propose efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for higher eigenvalues\\nand for the spectral gap, which enable the assembly of a subspace for the MOR\\napproximation of the spectral gap. Based on that, a second subspace is then\\ngenerated for the MOR approximation of the eigenspace associated with the\\nsmallest eigenvalue. We also provide efficiently computable conditions to\\nensure that the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue is fully captured in\\nthe reduced space. This work is motivated by a specific application: the\\nrepeated identifications of the states with minimal energy, the so-called\\nground states, of parametric quantum spin system models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:14:08Z\"}"}
