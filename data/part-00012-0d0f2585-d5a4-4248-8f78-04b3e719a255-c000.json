{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06588v1\", \"title\": \"A Digital Twin of an Electrical Distribution Grid: SoCal 28-Bus Dataset\", \"summary\": \"We provide an open-access dataset of phasor & waveform measurement units\\n(PMUs/WMUs) of a real-world electrical distribution network. The network\\nconsists of diverse sets of generation resources (including solar panels, fuel\\ncells, natural gas generators, and utility interconnections), loads (including\\nlarge-scale electric vehicle charging, data centers, central cooling, offices),\\ntopology changes (such as line outages and load transfers), as well as a\\nmixture of single- and three-phase networks. We describe a densely deployed PMU\\nsensor network in a distribution grid, in which all buses with non-zero power\\ninjections are measured. This approach enables a range of applications such as\\nstate estimation, system identification, power flow optimization, and feedback\\ncontrol, several of which are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we provide\\na synchronized waveform dataset which allows the analysis of harmonics,\\ntransient events, dynamic grid impedance, and stability. Data collection\\nstarted in 2023 while new data is generated continuously and made available\\nonline. A characterization of measurement error is provided. Finally, we\\nprovide circuit topology and parameters as a part of the dataset. Together, the\\ncircuit and timeseries data offer an opportunity for researchers to develop and\\ntest algorithms on a real-world system.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:35:07Z\"}"}
