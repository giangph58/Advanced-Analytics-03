Our approach, based on the fixed\\npoint index theory in cones, guarantees the existence of a coexistence fixed\\npoint - that is, one with nontrivial components. As an application, we prove\\nthe existence of periodic solutions with strictly positive components for a\\nsystem of second-order differential equations. In particular, we address cases\\ninvolving singular nonlinearities and hybrid terms, characterized by sublinear\\nbehavior in one component and superlinear behavior in the other.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA,math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:14:48Z\"}"}
