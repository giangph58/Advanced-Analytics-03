Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates\\nthe feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)\\nsystems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this\\ntask. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block\\n(SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive\\nbistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according\\nto the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of\\northogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing\\ntoward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The\\nCramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and\\nvelocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB\\nsignals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:36:11Z\"}"}
