{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24058v1\", \"title\": \"Mechanical Squeezed Kerr Oscillator based on Tapered Ion Trap\", \"summary\": \"We propose the realization of a mechanically squeezed Kerr oscillator with a\\nsingle ion in a tapered trap. We show that the motion coupling between the\\naxial and radial modes caused by the trap geometry leads to Kerr nonlinearity\\nof the radial mode with magnitude controlled by the trap frequencies. This\\nallows the realization of non-Gaussian quantum gates, which play a significant\\nrole in the universal set of continuous variable quantum gates. Furthermore, we\\nshow that, because of the nonlinearity of the ion trap, applying an\\noff-resonant time-varying electric field along the trap axis causes a motion\\nsqueezing of the radial mode. Finally, we discuss the motion mode frequency\\nspectrum of an ion crystal in a tapered trap. We show that the frequency gap\\nbetween the motion modes increases with trap nonlinearity, which benefits the\\nrealization of faster quantum gates.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:19:09Z\"}"}
