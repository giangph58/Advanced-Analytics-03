However, with the rapid advancement of cloud\\ncomputing and AI-driven models for database optimization, traditional virtual\\nindex approaches face significant challenges. Cloud-native environments often\\nprohibit direct conducting query optimization process on production databases\\ndue to stability requirements and data privacy concerns. Moreover, while AI\\nmodels show promising progress, their integration with database systems poses\\nchallenges in system complexity, inference acceleration, and model hot updates.\\nIn this paper, we present VIDEX, a three-layer disaggregated architecture that\\ndecouples database instances, the virtual index optimizer, and algorithm\\nservices, providing standardized interfaces for AI model integration. Users can\\nconfigure VIDEX by either collecting production statistics or by loading from a\\nprepared file; this setup allows for high-accurate what-if analyses based on\\nvirtual indexes, achieving query plans that are identical to those of the\\nproduction instance. Additionally, users can freely integrate new AI-driven\\nalgorithms into VIDEX. VIDEX has been successfully deployed at ByteDance,\\nserving thousands of MySQL instances daily and over millions of SQL queries for\\nindex optimization tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:52:13Z\"}"}
