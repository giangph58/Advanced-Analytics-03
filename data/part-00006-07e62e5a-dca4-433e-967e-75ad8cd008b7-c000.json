{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07734v1\", \"title\": \"On-Chip and Off-Chip TIA Amplifiers for Nanopore Signal Readout Design,\\n  Performance and Challenges: A Review\", \"summary\": \"Advancements in biomedical research have driven continuous innovations in\\nsensing and diagnostic technologies. Among these, nanopore based single\\nmolecule sensing and sequencing is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile\\nsensing methodology. Advancements in nanopore based approaches require\\nconcomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the\\npoint of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current\\nsensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal\\nreadout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip\\ntransimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic\\ncapacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies.\\nThis review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures\\nclassified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design\\nimplementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay\\nbetween noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse\\ntransimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on\\ncharacterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and\\noperational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in\\nprior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance\\nrange limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B\\nsystem to the designs reported in literature. The findings offer valuable\\ninsights into optimizing TIA designs for enhanced signal integrity in high\\nspeed and high sensitivity applications focusing on noise reduction, impedance\\nmatching, DC blocking, and offset cancellation techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY,q-bio.BM,q-bio.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:29:08Z\"}"}
