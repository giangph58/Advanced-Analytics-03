In this system, each site\\nhas two spins, each spin being an XY spin, that is having orientation\\ncontinuously varying in 2\\\\pi radians. Nearest-neighbor sites are coupled by\\ntwo-spin and four-spin interactions. The phase diagram has ordered phases that\\nare ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic in each of the spins, and phases that\\nare ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic in the multiplicative spin variable.\\nThe phase diagram exhibits two symmetrically situated reverse bifurcation\\npoints of the phase boundaries. The renormalization-group flows are in terms of\\nthe doubly composite Fourier coefficients of the exponentiated energy of\\nnearest-neighbor spins.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:27:33Z\"}"}
