F\\\\\\\"{u}redi, Kostochka and Luo showed that\\nthese two graphs play the same role when ``number of edges'' is replaced by\\n``number of t-stars,'' and that two members of a more general graph family\\nmaximize the number of edges among non-$k$-edge-Hamiltonian graphs. In this\\npaper we generalize their former result from Hamiltonicity to related\\nproperties (traceability, Hamiltonian-connectedness, $k$-edge Hamiltonicity,\\n$k$-Hamiltonicity) and their latter result from edges to $t$-stars. We identify\\na family of extremal graphs for each property that is forbidden. This problem\\nwithout the minimum degree condition was also open; here we conjecture a\\ncomplete description of the extremal family for each property, and prove the\\ncharacterization in some cases. Finally, using a different family of extremal\\ngraphs, we find the maximum number of $t$-stars in non-$k$-connected graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:15:42Z\"}"}
