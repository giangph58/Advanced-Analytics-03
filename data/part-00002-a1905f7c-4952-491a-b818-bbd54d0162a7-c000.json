In this work, we study the alpha-HMM algorithm motivated\\nby the optimal online filtering formulation in settings where the true state\\nevolves as a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities. We quantify the\\ndynamics of the algorithm in stationary environments, revealing a trade-off\\nbetween inference and adaptation, showing how key parameters and the quality of\\nobservations affect performance. Comprehensive theoretical analysis on the\\nnonlinear dynamical system that governs the evolution of the log-belief ratio\\nover time and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\\neffectively balances adaptation and inference performance.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:16:13Z\"}"}
