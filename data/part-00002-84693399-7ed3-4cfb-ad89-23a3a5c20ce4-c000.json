We compare the\\neffectiveness of various AI algorithms, including FFNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM,\\nacross multiple datasets (CALCE, NASA, UDDS) and scenarios (e.g., varying\\ntemperatures and driving conditions). Additionally, we analyze the factors\\ninfluencing SoH fluctuations, such as temperature and charge-discharge rates,\\nand validate our findings through simulations. The results demonstrate that\\nBiLSTM achieves the highest accuracy, with an average RMSE reduction of 15%\\ncompared to LSTM, highlighting its robustness in real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:58:39Z\"}"}
