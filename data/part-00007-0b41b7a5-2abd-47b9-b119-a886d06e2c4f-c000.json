This paper presents a new open dataset called UVG-VPC\\nfor the development, evaluation, and validation of MPEG Visual Volumetric\\nVideo-based Coding (V3C) technology. The dataset is distributed under its own\\nnon-commercial license. It consists of 12 point cloud test video sequences of\\ndiverse characteristics with respect to the motion, RGB texture, 3D geometry,\\nand surface occlusion of the points. Each sequence is 10 seconds long and\\ncomprises 250 frames captured at 25 frames per second. The sequences are\\nvoxelized with a geometry precision of 9 to 12 bits, and the voxel color\\nattributes are represented as 8-bit RGB values. The dataset also includes\\nassociated normals that make it more suitable for evaluating point cloud\\ncompression solutions. The main objective of releasing the UVG-VPC dataset is\\nto foster the development of V3C technologies and thereby shape the future in\\nthis field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:27:53Z\"}"}
