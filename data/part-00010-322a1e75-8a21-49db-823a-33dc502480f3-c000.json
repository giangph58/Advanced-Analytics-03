{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05916v1\", \"title\": \"Multilevel Quantum Rabi Models\", \"summary\": \"The quantum Rabi model, which describes the interaction between a simplified\\natom and a mode of the electromagnetic field, is a cornerstone of modern\\nquantum optics. One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a\\nperfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom\\nto a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the\\nsame field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form\\ndistinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the\\nspacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the\\naverage spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random\\ncouplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the\\nsystem reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of\\ndifferent couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way\\nthat depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the\\ncoupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\\\\sqrt{n}$ for random\\ncouplings (in the limit of large $n$). Our work thus suggests that multilevel\\nRabi systems could provide an attractive alternative route to accessing regimes\\nof very strong coupling in light-matter systems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:10:19Z\"}"}
