When an infinite tower of\\ncorrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in\\nwhich the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the\\nearly-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole\\nsolutions.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:26:03Z\"}"}
