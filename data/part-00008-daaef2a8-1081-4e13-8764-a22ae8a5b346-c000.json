Currently, compliance checking is predominantly\\nmanual, requiring significant time and highly skilled experts, while still\\nbeing prone to errors caused by the human factor. Various approaches have been\\nexplored to automate compliance checking, however, representing regulations in\\nOWL DL language which enables compliance checking through OWL reasoning has not\\nbeen adopted. In this work, we propose an annotation schema and an algorithm\\nthat transforms text annotations into machine-interpretable OWL DL code. The\\nproposed approach is validated through a proof-of-concept implementation\\napplied to examples from the building construction domain.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:05:21Z\"}"}
