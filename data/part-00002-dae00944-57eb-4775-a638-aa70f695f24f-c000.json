{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02506v1\", \"title\": \"Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple\\n  Eavesdroppers\", \"summary\": \"This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user\\ncommunication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The\\ncommunication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and\\neavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user\\nscheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy\\noutage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is\\nderived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better\\nunderstanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole\\nparameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy\\nrate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system\\nmodel. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value\\nand does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the\\nsource-to-keyhole channel.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:38:08Z\"}"}
