We call such $S$ a DSC semigroup. It is well\\nknown that all finite groups are DSC, and easy to see that every DSC semigroup\\nmust be simple. Building on this, we show that for broad classes of semigroups\\n-- including periodic, stable, inverse and several well-known types of simple\\nsemigroups -- the only DSC members are groups. However, it turns out that there\\nexist non-group DSC semigroups, which we obtain utilising a construction\\nintroduced by Byleen for the purpose of constructing interesting\\ncongruence-free semigroups. Such examples can additionally be regular or\\nbisimple.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:33:50Z\"}"}
