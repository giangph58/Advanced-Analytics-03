Under mild technical assumptions, in this paper we\\nprove the non-existence of non-trivial finite $\\\\Lambda$-submodules of\\nPontryagin duals of signed Selmer groups of a $p$-supersingular rational\\nelliptic curve over the anticyclotomic $\\\\mathbb Z_p$-extension of $K$, where\\n$\\\\Lambda$ is the corresponding Iwasawa algebra. In particular, we work under\\nthe assumption that our plus/minus Selmer groups have $\\\\Lambda$-corank $1$, so\\nthey are not $\\\\Lambda$-cotorsion. Our main theorem extends to the supersinular\\ncase analogous non-existence results by Bertolini in the ordinary setting;\\nfurthermore, since we cover the case where $p$ is inert in $K$, we refine\\nprevious results of Hatley-Lei-Vigni, which deal with $p$-supersingular\\nelliptic curves under the assumption that $p$ splits in $K$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT,math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:55:15Z\"}"}
