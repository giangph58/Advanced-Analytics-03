{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05756v1\", \"title\": \"Interpretable Non-linear Survival Analysis with Evolutionary Symbolic\\n  Regression\", \"summary\": \"Survival Regression (SuR) is a key technique for modeling time to event in\\nimportant applications such as clinical trials and semiconductor manufacturing.\\nCurrently, SuR algorithms belong to one of three classes: non-linear black-box\\n-- allowing adaptability to many datasets but offering limited interpretability\\n(e.g., tree ensembles); linear glass-box -- being easier to interpret but\\nlimited to modeling only linear interactions (e.g., Cox proportional hazards);\\nand non-linear glass-box -- allowing adaptability and interpretability, but\\nempirically found to have several limitations (e.g., explainable boosting\\nmachines, survival trees). In this work, we investigate whether Symbolic\\nRegression (SR), i.e., the automated search of mathematical expressions from\\ndata, can lead to non-linear glass-box survival models that are interpretable\\nand accurate. We propose an evolutionary, multi-objective, and multi-expression\\nimplementation of SR adapted to SuR. Our empirical results on five real-world\\ndatasets show that SR consistently outperforms traditional glass-box methods\\nfor SuR in terms of accuracy per number of dimensions in the model, while\\nexhibiting comparable accuracy with black-box methods. Furthermore, we offer\\nqualitative examples to assess the interpretability potential of SR models for\\nSuR.
