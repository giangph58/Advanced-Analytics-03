The introduced model is described in detail, with a\\nfocus on its modular structure, and proposes various configurations that\\ninclude various building insulation, heating methods, occupancy patterns, and\\nweather data to analyze different scenarios, and the energy consumption, CO2\\nemissions, and heating costs are compared and analyzed across 36 introduced\\nscenarios. The thermodynamic behavior of the model is shown to be consistent\\nwith real-world conditions, and the comparison of the scenarios concludes that\\nthe use of heat pumps for indoor heating in well-insulated buildings has\\nsignificant economic and sustainability benefits, whereas the use of natural\\ngas-fueled boilers is more cost-effective for buildings with low energy\\nratings.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:33:31Z\"}"}
