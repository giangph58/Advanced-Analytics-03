{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05112v1\", \"title\": \"ABCDWaveNet: Advancing Robust Road Ponding Detection in Fog through\\n  Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy\", \"summary\": \"Road ponding presents a significant threat to vehicle safety, particularly in\\nadverse fog conditions, where reliable detection remains a persistent challenge\\nfor Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To address this, we propose\\nABCDWaveNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging Dynamic\\nFrequency-Spatial Synergy for robust ponding detection in fog. The core of\\nABCDWaveNet achieves this synergy by integrating dynamic convolution for\\nadaptive feature extraction across varying visibilities with a wavelet-based\\nmodule for synergistic frequency-spatial feature enhancement, significantly\\nimproving robustness against fog interference. Building on this foundation,\\nABCDWaveNet captures multi-scale structural and contextual information,\\nsubsequently employing an Adaptive Attention Coupling Gate (AACG) to adaptively\\nfuse global and local features for enhanced accuracy. To facilitate realistic\\nevaluations under combined adverse conditions, we introduce the Foggy Low-Light\\nPuddle dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABCDWaveNet establishes\\nnew state-of-the-art performance, achieving significant Intersection over Union\\n(IoU) gains of 3.51%, 1.75%, and 1.03% on the Foggy-Puddle, Puddle-1000, and\\nour Foggy Low-Light Puddle datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its processing\\nspeed of 25.48 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin confirms its suitability for\\nADAS deployment. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed\\nDynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy within ABCDWaveNet, offering valuable\\ninsights for developing proactive road safety solutions capable of operating\\nreliably in challenging weather conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:15:48Z\"}"}
