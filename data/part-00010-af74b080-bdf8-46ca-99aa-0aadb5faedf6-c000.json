This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where\\nvariations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across\\nviewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations\\nand view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view\\nsynthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D\\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel\\napproach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse\\nchallenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix\\nmapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including\\nlow-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the\\noriginal 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and\\n3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with\\nimproved reconstruction quality.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:54:57Z\"}"}
