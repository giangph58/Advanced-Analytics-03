{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06098v1\", \"title\": \"Extremely asymmetric bipolar magnetic field of the Bp star HD 57372\", \"summary\": \"Fossil magnetic fields of early-type stars are typically characterised by\\nsymmetric or slightly distorted oblique dipolar surface geometries. Contrary to\\nthis trend, the late-B magnetic chemically peculiar star HD 57372 exhibits an\\nunusually large rotational variation of its mean magnetic field modulus,\\nsuggesting a highly atypical field configuration. In this study, we present a\\nZeeman Doppler imaging analysis of HD 57372, revealing an exceptionally\\nasymmetric bipolar magnetic topology, rarely observed in early-type stars.\\nAccording to our magnetic field maps, reconstructed from the intensity and\\ncircular polarisation profiles of Fe, Cr, and Ti lines, approximately 66 per\\ncent of the stellar surface is covered by a diffuse outward-directed radial\\nfield, with local field strengths reaching 11.6 kG, while the remaining 34 per\\ncent hosts a highly concentrated inward-directed field with a strong horizontal\\ncomponent and a peak strength of 17.8 kG. These unusual surface magnetic field\\ncharacteristics make HD 57372 a notable object for testing fossil-field\\ntheories and interpreting phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations of\\nearly-type stars.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:40:25Z\"}"}
