This document summarizes why the SND@LHC\\nCollaboration intends to continue taking data at the High Luminosity LHC\\n(HL-LHC). The upgraded detector will instrument the regions of both the\\nneutrino vertex and the magnetized calorimeter with silicon microstrips. The\\nuse of this technology will allow us to continue the physics program of the\\ncurrent SND@LHC detector with higher statistics. It will also offer new\\npossibilities. For instance, the magnetization of the hadron calorimeter will\\nenable the separation between neutrinos and antineutrinos. This could lead to\\nthe first direct observation of tau antineutrinos. The use of ultrafast timing\\nlayers will enable triggers to be sent to ATLAS, potentially allowing the\\nidentification of the charm quark pair that produced the neutrino interacting\\nin the detector. Such tagging of the neutrino source would fulfill Pontecorvo\\noriginal proposal of a tagged neutrino beam. The experiment will perform unique\\nmeasurements with high energy neutrinos and will also provide a means to\\nmeasure gluon parton distribution functions in a previously unexplored domain\\n(Bjorkenx <10^-5). Furthermore, the technological advancements of the upgrade\\nand the experience that will be gained in the areas of operation and data\\nanalysis will play a crucial role in the design of the neutrino detector for\\nthe SHiP experiment.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:45:38Z\"}"}
