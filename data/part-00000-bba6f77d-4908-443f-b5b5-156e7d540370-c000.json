Our motivation for this study comes from\\nefficient usage of cross edges in relay networks for overall improvement in\\nnetwork performance. We first consider Bernoulli planar matchings with a\\nconstraint on the edge length and obtain deviation estimates for the maximum\\nsize of a planar matching. We then equip each edge of the complete bipartite\\ngraph with a positive random weight and obtain bounds on the minimum weight of\\na planar matching containing a given number of edges. We also use segmentation\\nand martingale methods to obtain~\\\\(L^2-\\\\)convergence of the minimum weight,\\nappropriately scaled and centred.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:09:54Z\"}"}
