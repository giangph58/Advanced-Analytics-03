{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02741v1\", \"title\": \"A Complete Classification of Fourier Summation Formulas on the real line\", \"summary\": \"We completely classify Fourier summation formulas of the form $$\\n  \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\widehat{\\\\varphi}(t) d\\\\mu(t)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\na(\\\\lambda_n)\\\\varphi(\\\\lambda_n), $$ that hold for any test function $\\\\varphi$,\\nwhere $\\\\widehat\\\\varphi$ is the Fourier transform of $\\\\varphi$, $\\\\mu$ is a fixed\\ncomplex measure on $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and $a:\\\\{\\\\lambda_n\\\\}_{n\\\\geq 0}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C}$ is\\na fixed function. We only assume the decay condition $$ \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\n\\\\frac{d |\\\\mu|(t)}{(1+t^2)^{c_1}} + \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 0} |a(\\\\lambda_n)|e^{-c_2\\n|\\\\lambda_n|}<\\\\infty, $$ for some $c_1,c_2>0$. This completes the work initiated\\nby the first author previously, where the condition $c_1\\\\leq 1$ was required.\\nWe prove that any such pair $(\\\\mu,a)$ can be uniquely associated with a\\nholomorphic map $F(z)$ in the upper-half space that is both almost periodic and\\nbelongs to a certain higher index Nevanlinna class. The converse is also true:\\nFor any such function $F$ it is possible to generate a Fourier summation pair\\n$(\\\\mu,a)$. We provide important examples of such summation formulas not\\ncontemplated by the previous results, such as Selberg's trace formula.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA,math.MG,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:28:18Z\"}"}
