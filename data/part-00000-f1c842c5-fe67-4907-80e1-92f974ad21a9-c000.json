{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21709v1\", \"title\": \"Redefining Network Topology in Complex Systems: Merging Centrality\\n  Metrics, Spectral Theory, and Diffusion Dynamics\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a novel framework that combines traditional centrality\\nmeasures with eigenvalue spectra and diffusion processes for a more\\ncomprehensive analysis of complex networks. While centrality measures such as\\ndegree, closeness, and betweenness have been commonly used to assess nodal\\nimportance, they provide limited insight into dynamic network behaviors. By\\nincorporating eigenvalue analysis, which evaluates network robustness and\\nconnectivity through spectral properties, and diffusion processes that model\\ninformation flow, this framework offers a deeper understanding of how networks\\nfunction under dynamic conditions. Applied to synthetic networks, the approach\\nidentifies key nodes not only by centrality but also by their role in diffusion\\ndynamics and vulnerability points, offering a multi-dimensional view that\\ntraditional methods alone cannot. This integrated analysis enables a more\\nprecise identification of critical nodes and potential weaknesses, with\\nimplications for improving network resilience in fields ranging from\\nepidemiology to cybersecurity. Keywords: Centrality measures, eigenvalue\\nspectra, diffusion processes, network analysis, network robustness, information\\nflow, synthetic networks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.OH\", \"categories\": \"cs.OH\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:21:46Z\"}"}
