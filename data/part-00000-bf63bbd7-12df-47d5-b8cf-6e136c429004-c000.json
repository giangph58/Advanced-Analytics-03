{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24340v1\", \"title\": \"Faster Rates for No-Regret Learning in General Games via Cautious\\n  Optimism\", \"summary\": \"We establish the first uncoupled learning algorithm that attains $O(n \\\\log^2\\nd \\\\log T)$ per-player regret in multi-player general-sum games, where $n$ is\\nthe number of players, $d$ is the number of actions available to each player,\\nand $T$ is the number of repetitions of the game. Our results exponentially\\nimprove the dependence on $d$ compared to the $O(n\\\\, d \\\\log T)$ regret\\nattainable by Log-Regularized Lifted Optimistic FTRL [Far+22c], and also reduce\\nthe dependence on the number of iterations $T$ from $\\\\log^4 T$ to $\\\\log T$\\ncompared to Optimistic Hedge, the previously well-studied algorithm with $O(n\\n\\\\log d \\\\log^4 T)$ regret [DFG21]. Our algorithm is obtained by combining the\\nclassic Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) with an adaptive,\\nnon-monotonic learning rate that paces the learning process of the players,\\nmaking them more cautious when their regret becomes too negative.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.LG,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:25:33Z\"}"}
