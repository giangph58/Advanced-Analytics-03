{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01895v1\", \"title\": \"Polynomially convex embeddings and CR singularities of real manifolds\", \"summary\": \"It is proved that any smooth manifold $\\\\mathcal M$ of dimension $m$ admits a\\nsmooth polynomially convex embedding into $\\\\mathbb C^n$ when $n\\\\geq \\\\lfloor\\n5m/4\\\\rfloor$. Further, such embeddings are dense in the space of smooth maps\\nfrom $\\\\mathcal M$ into $\\\\mathbb C^n$ in the $\\\\mathcal C^3$-topology. The\\ncomponents of any such embedding give smooth generators of the algebra of\\ncomplex-valued continuous functions on $\\\\mathcal M$. A key ingredient of the\\nproof is a coordinate-free description of certain notions of (non)degeneracy,\\nas defined by Webster and Coffman, for CR-singularities of order one of an\\nembedded real manifold in $\\\\mathbb C^n$. The main result is obtained by\\ninductively perturbing each stratum of degeneracy to produce a global\\npolynomially convex embedding.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CV\", \"categories\": \"math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:55:17Z\"}"}
