{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23828v1\", \"title\": \"High-Throughput Exploration of NV-like Color Centers Across Host\\n  Materials\", \"summary\": \"Point defects in semiconductors offer a promising platform for advancing\\nquantum technologies due to their localized energy states and controllable spin\\nproperties. Prior research has focused on a limited set of defects within\\nmaterials such as diamond, silicon carbide, and hexagonal boron nitride. We\\npresent a high-throughput study to systematically identify and evaluate point\\ndefects across a diverse range of host materials, aiming to uncover previously\\nunexplored defects in novel host materials suitable for use in quantum\\napplications. A range of host materials are selected for their desirable\\nproperties, such as appropriate bandgaps, crystal structure, and absence of d-\\nor f-electrons. The Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) software\\nframework is used to generate vacancies, substitutions with s- and p-elements,\\nand interstitials in these materials and use density functional theory to\\ncalculate key properties such as Zero-Phonon Lines (ZPLs), ionic displacements,\\nTransition Dipole Moments (TDMs), and formation energies. Special attention is\\ngiven to charge correction methods for materials with dielectric anisotropy. We\\nuncover new defect-host combinations with advantageous properties for quantum\\napplications: 28 defects across 11 isotropic and 2 anisotropic host materials\\nshow properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond.\\nBeryllium (Be) substitutional defects in SrS, MgS, and SrO emerge as particu-\\nlarly promising. These findings contribute to diversifying and enhancing the\\nmaterials available for quantum technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:22:24Z\"}"}
