Human hands are the primary tool for\\ninteracting with the environment and essential for realistic human behavior\\nmodeling, yet existing 3D hand and head avatar models often overlook the\\ncrucial aspect of hand-body interactions, such as between hand and face. We\\npresent InteracttAvatar, the first model to faithfully capture the\\nphotorealistic appearance of dynamic hand and non-rigid hand-face interactions.\\nOur novel Dynamic Gaussian Hand model, combining template model and 3D Gaussian\\nSplatting as well as a dynamic refinement module, captures pose-dependent\\nchange, e.g. the fine wrinkles and complex shadows that occur during\\narticulation. Importantly, our hand-face interaction module models the subtle\\ngeometry and appearance dynamics that underlie common gestures. Through\\nexperiments of novel view synthesis, self reenactment and cross-identity\\nreenactment, we demonstrate that InteracttAvatar can reconstruct hand and\\nhand-face interactions from monocular or multiview videos with high-fidelity\\ndetails and be animated with novel poses.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:55:43Z\"}"}
