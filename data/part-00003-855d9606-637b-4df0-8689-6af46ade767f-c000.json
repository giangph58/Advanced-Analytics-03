By investigating orbital torque and\\norbital pumping in W/Ni bilayers, we show that the charge-orbital\\ninterconversion in the bulk of the W layer exhibits opposite signs in the\\ndirect and inverse processes -- the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects\\nbeing positive and negative, respectively. This finding provides direct\\nevidence of local non-reciprocity in the charge-orbital interconversion, in\\nagreement with a theoretical prediction. These results highlight the unique\\ncharacteristics of charge-orbital coupled transport and offer fundamental\\ninsights into the mechanisms underlying orbital-current-driven phenomena.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:45:31Z\"}"}
