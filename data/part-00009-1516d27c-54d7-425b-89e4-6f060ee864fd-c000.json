Using\\n``energy'' techniques several new estimates are derived that together confine\\nthe spectrum to a subset of the complex plane. Importantly, a sufficient\\ncondition is obtained which ensures that the spectrum concentrates on the real\\naxis, and a bounded subset of the imaginary axis of the spectral variable as\\nthe semi-classical parameter tends to zero.\", \"main_category\": \"math.SP\", \"categories\": \"math.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:08:36Z\"}"}
