By\\nincorporating SU(2) symmetry transformations that couple explicitly to spin\\ndegrees of freedom, our model demonstrates distinct topological properties\\noriginating from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and gauge-induced\\nspin-orbit coupling. Exact diagonalization and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ)\\nanalyses reveal distinct spectral phases, characterized by complex-energy loops\\nunder periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and substantial localization\\nindicative of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundary\\nconditions (OBC). We define a gauge-invariant winding number for non-Hermitian\\nchiral symmetry, clarifying the topological transitions. Furthermore, we\\nuncover a novel self-healing phenomenon in response to dynamically introduced\\nscattering potentials, showing significant robustness enhancement induced by\\nappropriate non-Abelian SU(2) couplings. These findings clarify how non-Abelian\\ngauge interactions can control spin-dependent localization and dynamical\\nstability in non-Hermitian topological systems, guiding the development of\\ntunable quantum devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:41:35Z\"}"}
