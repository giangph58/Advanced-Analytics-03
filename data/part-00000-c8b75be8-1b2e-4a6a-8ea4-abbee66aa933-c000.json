{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24132v1\", \"title\": \"Banked Memories for Soft SIMT Processors\", \"summary\": \"Recent advances in soft GPGPU architectures have shown that a small (<10K\\nLUT), high performance (770 MHz) processor is possible in modern FPGAs. In this\\npaper we architect and evaluate soft SIMT processor banked memories, which can\\nsupport high bandwidth (up to 16 ports) while maintaining high speed (over 770\\nMHz). We compare 9 different memory architectures, including simpler multi-port\\nmemories, and run a total of 51 benchmarks (different combinations of\\nalgorithms, data sizes and processor memories) to develop a comprehensive set\\nof data which will guide the reader in making an informed memory architecture\\ndecision for their application. Our benchmarks are comprised of matrix\\ntranspositions (memory intensive) and FFTs (split between memory accesses,\\nfloating point, and integer computations) to provide a balanced evaluation. We\\nshow that the simpler (but more memory block intensive) multi-port memories\\noffer higher performance than the more architecturally complex banked memories\\nfor many applications, especially for smaller memories, but the effective\\nfootprint cost of the multi-port memories quickly becomes prohibitive as\\ndataset sizes increase. Our banked memory implementation results - high\\nbandwidth, high Fmax, and high density - can be used for other FPGA\\napplications as well, such as HLS (High Level Synthesis).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:17:12Z\"}"}
