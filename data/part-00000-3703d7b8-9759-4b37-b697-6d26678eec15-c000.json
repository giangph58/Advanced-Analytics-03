Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via\\ndynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area\\nof active current research. Here, we report a flocking transition sustained\\npurely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities in a system of\\nchemically interacting colloidal particles. The basic requirements to sustain\\nthe flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net\\nrepulsive torques, with the time scale individual colloids move a unit length\\nbeing dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals.\\nSwitching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline\\nstructure. The generality of this phenomenon is displayed for a range of\\nattractive translational forces to which the flock is robust. We rationalize\\nthese results with a phenomenological hydrodynamical model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:09:48Z\"}"}
