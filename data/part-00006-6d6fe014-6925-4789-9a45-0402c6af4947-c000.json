{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02485v1\", \"title\": \"Tilted dipolar bosons in the quasi-2D regime: from liquid stripes to\\n  droplets\", \"summary\": \"We characterize a system of tilted dipoles in a quasi two-dimensional\\n(flattened) geometry and in the thermodynamic limit. We consider a finite\\ntrapping in the z-axis achievable in current experiments. We compute the phase\\ndiagram of the system at its equilibrium density for high tilting angles, where\\nit becomes self-bound, and a striped liquid state emerges. To characterize the\\nsystem, we perform a variational calculation, which is benchmarked with the\\nsolution of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We connect the\\nphenomenology in the thermodynamic limit to the physics of the finite-size\\nsystem, provide parameters for the realization of potentially supersolid\\nstriped states and study the critical number for dipolar droplet formation. Our\\nresults are helpful to guide potential experiments in the study of dipolar\\natoms in quasi two-dimensional geometries in the dipole-dominated regime.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:07:48Z\"}"}
