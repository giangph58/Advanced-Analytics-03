{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07065v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Downstream Analysis in Genome Sequencing: Species\\n  Classification While Basecalling\", \"summary\": \"The ability to quickly and accurately identify microbial species in a sample,\\nknown as metagenomic profiling, is critical across various fields, from\\nhealthcare to environmental science. This paper introduces a novel method to\\nprofile signals coming from sequencing devices in parallel with determining\\ntheir nucleotide sequences, a process known as basecalling, via a\\nmulti-objective deep neural network for simultaneous basecalling and\\nmulti-class genome classification. We introduce a new loss strategy where\\nlosses for basecalling and classification are back-propagated separately, with\\nmodel weights combined for the shared layers, and a pre-configured ranking\\nstrategy allowing top-K species accuracy, giving users flexibility to choose\\nbetween higher accuracy or higher speed at identifying the species. We achieve\\nstate-of-the-art basecalling accuracies, while classification accuracies meet\\nand exceed the results of state-of-the-art binary classifiers, attaining an\\naverage of 92.5%/98.9% accuracy at identifying the top-1/3 species among a\\ntotal of 17 genomes in the Wick bacterial dataset. The work presented here has\\nimplications for future studies in metagenomic profiling by accelerating the\\nbottleneck step of matching the DNA sequence to the correct genome.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.GN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.GN,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:30:43Z\"}"}
