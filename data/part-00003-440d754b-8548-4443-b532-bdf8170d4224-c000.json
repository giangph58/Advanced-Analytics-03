Using a model of\\ncompeting s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known\\ncollective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a\\nsupercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of\\nBardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and\\nLeggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba\\nspin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes\\nare optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral\\nground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and\\ntransverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral\\np+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but\\ncontribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These\\nresults promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a\\nvariety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and\\nsuperconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order\\nparameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:32:42Z\"}"}
