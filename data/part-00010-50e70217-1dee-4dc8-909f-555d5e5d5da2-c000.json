{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06240v1\", \"title\": \"Dictionary-free Koopman Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicles in\\n  Mixed Traffic\", \"summary\": \"Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC) and Data-EnablEd Predictive Control\\n(DeePC) use linear models to approximate nonlinear systems and integrate them\\nwith predictive control. Both approaches have recently demonstrated promising\\nperformance in controlling Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed\\ntraffic. However, selecting appropriate lifting functions for the Koopman\\noperator in KMPC is challenging, while the data-driven representation from\\nWillems' fundamental lemma in DeePC must be updated to approximate the local\\nlinearization when the equilibrium traffic state changes. In this paper, we\\npropose a dictionary-free Koopman model predictive control (DF-KMPC) for CAV\\ncontrol. In particular, we first introduce a behavioral perspective to identify\\nthe optimal dictionary-free Koopman linear model. We then utilize an iterative\\nalgorithm to compute a data-driven approximation of the dictionary-free Koopman\\nrepresentation. Integrating this data-driven linear representation with\\npredictive control leads to our DF-KMPC, which eliminates the need to select\\nlifting functions and update the traffic equilibrium state. Nonlinear traffic\\nsimulations show that DF-KMPC effectively mitigates traffic waves and improves\\ntracking performance.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:40:54Z\"}"}
