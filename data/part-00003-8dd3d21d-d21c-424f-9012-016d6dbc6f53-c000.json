{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04720v1\", \"title\": \"Fractal Zeta Functions and Complex Dimensions of Ahlfors Metric Measure\\n  Spaces\", \"summary\": \"While classical analysis dealt primarily with smooth spaces, much research\\nhas been done in the last half century on expanding the theory to the nonsmooth\\ncase. Metric Measure spaces are the natural setting for such analysis, and it\\nis thus important to understand the geometry of subsets of these spaces. In\\nthis paper we will focus on the geometry of Ahlfors regular spaces, Metric\\nMeasure spaces with an additional regularity condition. Historically, fractals\\nhave been studied using different ideas of dimension which have all proven to\\nbe unsatisfactory to some degree. The theory of complex dimensions, developed\\nby M.L. Lapidus and a number of collaborators, was developed in part to better\\nunderstand fractality in the Euclidean case and seeks to overcome these\\nproblems. Of particular interest is the recent theory of complex dimensions in\\nhigher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, as studied by M.L.Lapidus, G. Radunovi\\\\'c,\\nand D. Zubrini\\\\'c, who introduced and studied the properties of the distance\\nzeta function $\\\\zeta_A$. We will show that this theory of complex dimensions\\nnaturally generalizes to the case of Ahlfors regular spaces, as the distance\\nzeta function can be modified to these spaces and all of its main properties\\ncarry over. We also provide a selection of examples in Ahlfors spaces, as well\\nas hints that the theory can be expanded to a more general setting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.MG\", \"categories\": \"math.MG,math.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:12:07Z\"}"}
