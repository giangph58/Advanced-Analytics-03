{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01348v1\", \"title\": \"Prompt-Guided Attention Head Selection for Focus-Oriented Image\\n  Retrieval\", \"summary\": \"The goal of this paper is to enhance pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT)\\nmodels for focus-oriented image retrieval with visual prompting. In real-world\\nimage retrieval scenarios, both query and database images often exhibit\\ncomplexity, with multiple objects and intricate backgrounds. Users often want\\nto retrieve images with specific object, which we define as the Focus-Oriented\\nImage Retrieval (FOIR) task. While a standard image encoder can be employed to\\nextract image features for similarity matching, it may not perform optimally in\\nthe multi-object-based FOIR task. This is because each image is represented by\\na single global feature vector. To overcome this, a prompt-based image\\nretrieval solution is required. We propose an approach called Prompt-guided\\nattention Head Selection (PHS) to leverage the head-wise potential of the\\nmulti-head attention mechanism in ViT in a promptable manner. PHS selects\\nspecific attention heads by matching their attention maps with user's visual\\nprompts, such as a point, box, or segmentation. This empowers the model to\\nfocus on specific object of interest while preserving the surrounding visual\\ncontext. Notably, PHS does not necessitate model re-training and avoids any\\nimage alteration. Experimental results show that PHS substantially improves\\nperformance on multiple datasets, offering a practical and training-free\\nsolution to enhance model performance in the FOIR task.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:33:27Z\"}"}
