{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21742v1\", \"title\": \"Les Houches lectures on non-perturbative Seiberg-Witten geometry\", \"summary\": \"In these lectures we detail the interplay between the low-energy dynamics of\\nquantum field theories with four supercharges and the exact WKB analysis. This\\nexposition may be the first comprehensive account of this connection,\\ncontaining various novel arguments and illustrative examples.\\n  The lectures start with the introduction of massive two-dimensional\\n$\\\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories and their spectra of BPS solitons. We place these\\ntheories in a two-dimensional cigar background with supersymmetric boundary\\nconditions labelled by a phase $\\\\zeta = e^{i \\\\vartheta}$, while turning on the\\ntwo-dimensional $\\\\Omega$-background with parameter~$\\\\epsilon$. We show that the\\nresulting partition function $\\\\mathcal{Z}_{\\\\mathrm{2d}}^\\\\vartheta(\\\\epsilon)$\\ncan be characterized as the Borel-summed solution, in the direction\\n$\\\\vartheta$, to an associated Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation. The partition function\\n$\\\\mathcal{Z}_{\\\\mathrm{2d}}^\\\\vartheta(\\\\epsilon)$ is locally constant in the\\nphase $\\\\vartheta$ and jumps across phases $\\\\vartheta_\\\\textrm{BPS}$ associated\\nwith the BPS solitons. Since these jumps are non-perturbative in the\\nparameter~$\\\\epsilon$, we refer to $Z^\\\\vartheta_\\\\mathrm{2d}(\\\\epsilon)$ as the\\nnon-perturbative partition function for the original two-dimensional\\n$\\\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory. We completely determine this partition function\\n$\\\\mathcal{Z}^\\\\vartheta_\\\\mathrm{2d}(\\\\epsilon)$ in two classes of examples,\\nLandau-Ginzburg models and gauged linear sigma models, and show that\\n$\\\\mathcal{Z}^\\\\vartheta_\\\\mathrm{2d}(\\\\epsilon)$ encodes the well-known vortex\\npartition function at a special phase $\\\\vartheta_\\\\textrm{FN}$ associated with\\nthe presence of self-solitons. This analysis generalizes to four-dimensional\\n$\\\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Omega$-background.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math.CA,math.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:51:48Z\"}"}
