{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23975v1\", \"title\": \"A Reactive Framework for Whole-Body Motion Planning of Mobile\\n  Manipulators Combining Reinforcement Learning and SDF-Constrained Quadratic\\n  Programmi\", \"summary\": \"As an important branch of embodied artificial intelligence, mobile\\nmanipulators are increasingly applied in intelligent services, but their\\nredundant degrees of freedom also limit efficient motion planning in cluttered\\nenvironments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid learning and\\noptimization framework for reactive whole-body motion planning of mobile\\nmanipulators. We develop the Bayesian distributional soft actor-critic\\n(Bayes-DSAC) algorithm to improve the quality of value estimation and the\\nconvergence performance of the learning. Additionally, we introduce a quadratic\\nprogramming method constrained by the signed distance field to enhance the\\nsafety of the obstacle avoidance motion. We conduct experiments and make\\ncomparison with standard benchmark. The experimental results verify that our\\nproposed framework significantly improves the efficiency of reactive whole-body\\nmotion planning, reduces the planning time, and improves the success rate of\\nmotion planning. Additionally, the proposed reinforcement learning method\\nensures a rapid learning process in the whole-body planning task. The novel\\nframework allows mobile manipulators to adapt to complex environments more\\nsafely and efficiently.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:37:02Z\"}"}
