{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07631v1\", \"title\": \"The super Alternative Daugavet property for Banach spaces\", \"summary\": \"We introduce the super alternative Daugavet property (super ADP) which lies\\nstrictly between the Daugavet property and the Alternative Daugavet property as\\nfollows. A Banach space $X$ has the super ADP if for every element $x$ in the\\nunit sphere and for every relatively weakly open subset $W$ of the unit ball\\nintersecting the unit sphere, one can find an element $y\\\\in W$ and a modulus\\none scalar $\\\\theta$ such that $\\\\|x+\\\\theta y\\\\|$ is almost two. It is known that\\nspaces with the Daugavet property satisfy this condition, and that this\\ncondition implies the Alternative Daugavet property. We first provide examples\\nof super ADP spaces which fail the Daugavet property. We show that the norm of\\na super ADP space is rough, hence the space cannot be Asplund, and we also\\nprove that the space fails the point of continuity property (particularly, the\\nRadon--Nikod\\\\'ym property). In particular, we get examples of spaces with the\\nAlternative Daugavet property that fail the super ADP. For a better\\nunderstanding of the differences between the super ADP, the Daugavet property,\\nand the Alternative Daugavet property, we will also consider the localizations\\nof these three properties and prove that they behave rather differently. As a\\nconsequence, we provide characterizations of the super ADP for spaces of\\nvector-valued continuous functions and of vector-valued integrable functions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:25:23Z\"}"}
