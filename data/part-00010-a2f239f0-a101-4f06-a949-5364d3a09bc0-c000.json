{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05102v1\", \"title\": \"Underreporting of Intimate Partner Violence in Brazil\", \"summary\": \"According to WHO (2013), in general 30% of all women worldwide who have been\\nin a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by their\\nintimate partner. However, only a small percentage of intimate partner violence\\n(IPV) victims report it to the police. This phenomenon of under-reporting is\\nknown as ``dark figure''. This paper aims to investigate the factors associated\\nwith the reporting decision of IPV victims to the police in Brazil using the\\nthird wave of the ``Pesquisa de Condi\\\\c{c}\\\\~{o}es Socioecon\\\\^{o}micas e\\nViol\\\\^{e}ncia Dom\\\\'{e}stica e Familiar contra a Mulher ($PCSVDF^{Mulher}$)''.\\nUsing a bivariate probit regression model with sample selection, we found that\\nolder white women, those who do not tolerate domestic violence, and women who\\nhave experienced physical violence are more likely to report IPV to the police.\\nIn contrast, married women, those with partners who abuse alcohol and those who\\nwitnessed or knew that their mothers had experienced IPV, are less likely to\\nreport it to law enforcement.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC,stat.OT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:09:35Z\"}"}
