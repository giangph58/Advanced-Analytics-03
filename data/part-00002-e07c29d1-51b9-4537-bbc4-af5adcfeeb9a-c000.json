{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02640v1\", \"title\": \"RoSMM: A Robust and Secure Multi-Modal Watermarking Framework for\\n  Diffusion Models\", \"summary\": \"Current image watermarking technologies are predominantly categorized into\\ntext watermarking techniques and image steganography; however, few methods can\\nsimultaneously handle text and image-based watermark data, which limits their\\napplicability in complex digital environments. This paper introduces an\\ninnovative multi-modal watermarking approach, drawing on the concept of vector\\ndiscretization in encoder-based vector quantization. By constructing adjacency\\nmatrices, the proposed method enables the transformation of text watermarks\\ninto robust image-based representations, providing a novel multi-modal\\nwatermarking paradigm for image generation applications. Additionally, this\\nstudy presents a newly designed image restoration module to mitigate image\\ndegradation caused by transmission losses and various noise interferences,\\nthereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the watermark. Experimental\\nresults validate the robustness of the method under multiple noise attacks,\\nproviding a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for digital image\\ncopyright protection.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.MM\", \"categories\": \"cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:36:08Z\"}"}
