Here we propose to use it as a building block\\nto construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has\\nthe characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal\\nhopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we\\nanalyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin\\nexcitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\\\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which\\nleads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\\\\mathcal{PT}$\\nsymmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\\\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry\\nwith exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from\\none region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction\\nparameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze\\nthe spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of\\nmodes corresponding to gain and loss.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:51:15Z\"}"}
