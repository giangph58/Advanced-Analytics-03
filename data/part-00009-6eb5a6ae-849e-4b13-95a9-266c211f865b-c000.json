{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348v1\", \"title\": \"Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory\", \"summary\": \"Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum\\nfield theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in\\nthe mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of\\nLiouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a\\nnegative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than\\nordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this \\\"wrong sign\\\"\\nrequires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a\\ntheory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ\\nformula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the\\nso-called \\\"charge neutrality condition\\\". Expressions are derived also for the\\n$k$-point correlation functions for all $k\\\\ge 3$, and it is shown that these\\nfunctions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is\\nsent to zero.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,hep-th,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:33:00Z\"}"}
