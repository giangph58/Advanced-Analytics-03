{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06145v1\", \"title\": \"Deploying Chatbots in Customer Service: Adoption Hurdles and Simple\\n  Remedies\", \"summary\": \"Despite recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, the use of chatbot\\ntechnology in customer service continues to face adoption hurdles. This paper\\nexplores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design\\nlevers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to\\nstudy chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these\\nexperiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in\\nchatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently\\nthan expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this\\nunderutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a\\nprocess with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a\\nsecond, expert service stage -- a behavior we term \\\"gatekeeper aversion\\\". We\\nshow that gatekeeper aversion can be further amplified by a secondary hurdle,\\nalgorithm aversion. Second, chatbot uptake can be increased by providing\\ncustomers with average waiting times in the chatbot channel, as well as by\\nbeing more transparent about chatbot capabilities and limitations. Third,\\nmethodologically, we show that chatbot adoption can depend on experimental\\nimplementation. In particular, chatbot adoption decreases further as (i) stakes\\nare increased, (ii) the human/algorithmic nature of the server is manipulated\\nwith more realism. Our results suggest that firms should continue to prioritize\\ninvestments in chatbot technology. However, less expensive, process-related\\ninterventions can also be effective. These may include being more transparent\\nabout the types of queries that are (or are not) suitable for chatbots,\\nemphasizing chatbot reliability and quick resolution times, as well as\\nproviding faster live agent access to customers who experienced chatbot\\nfailure.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,econ.GN,q-fin.EC,J.4\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:40:31Z\"}"}
