{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02437v1\", \"title\": \"MonoGS++: Fast and Accurate Monocular RGB Gaussian SLAM\", \"summary\": \"We present MonoGS++, a novel fast and accurate Simultaneous Localization and\\nMapping (SLAM) method that leverages 3D Gaussian representations and operates\\nsolely on RGB inputs. While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods\\nlargely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency\\nand only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate\\nsparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality\\nof 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological\\nenhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian\\ninsertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed\\nareas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module\\nand planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces\\nbetter. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic\\nReplica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the\\nstate-of-the-art. Additionally, our method realized a significant 5.57x\\nimprovement in frames per second (fps) over the previous state-of-the-art,\\nMonoGS.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T09:51:51Z\"}"}
