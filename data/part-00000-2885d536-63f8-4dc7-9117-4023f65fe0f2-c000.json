The test statistic is the\\nmaximum of several Chatterjee's rank correlations and critical values are\\ncomputed via a block multiplier bootstrap. The test is shown to asymptotically\\ncontrol size uniformly over a large class of data-generating processes, even\\nwhen the number of variables is much larger than sample size. The test is\\nconsistent against any fixed alternative. It can be combined with a stepwise\\nprocedure for selecting those variables from the pool that violate\\nindependence, while controlling the family-wise error rate. All formal results\\nleave the dependence among variables in the pool completely unrestricted. In\\nsimulations, we find that our test is very powerful, outperforming existing\\ntests in most scenarios considered, particularly in high dimensions and/or when\\nthe variables in the pool are dependent.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:28:15Z\"}"}
