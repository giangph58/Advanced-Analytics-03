Within this theory, we discuss the method of deriving a stellar\\nisotropic model. In this respect, we implement the equations of motion of STEGR\\ntheory to a spacetime that is symmetric in a spherical manner, resulting in a\\nset of nonlinear differential equations with more unknowns than equations. To\\nsolve this issue, we assume a special form of $g_{tt}$, and suppose a null\\nvalue of the anisotropy to obtain the form of $g_{rr}$. We then investigate the\\npossibility of obtaining an isotropic stellar model consistent with\\nobservational data. To test the stability of our model, we apply the adiabatic\\nindex and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Furthermore, we examine our\\nmodel using different observed values of radii and masses of pulsars, showing\\nthat all of them fit in a consistent way.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:57:34Z\"}"}
