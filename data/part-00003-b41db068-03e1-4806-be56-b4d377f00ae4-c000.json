{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07635v1\", \"title\": \"Generative Artificial Intelligence for Internet of Things Computing: A\\n  Systematic Survey\", \"summary\": \"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within the\\nInternet of Things (IoT) is garnering considerable interest. This growing\\nattention stems from the continuous evolution and widespread adoption they are\\nboth having individually, enough to spontaneously reshape numerous sectors,\\nincluding Healthcare, Manufacturing, and Smart Cities. Hence, their increasing\\npopularity has catalyzed further extensive research for understanding the\\npotential of the duo GenAI-IoT, how they interplay, and to which extent their\\nsynergy can innovate the state-of-the-art in their individual scenarios.\\nHowever, despite the increasing prominence of GenAI for IoT Computing, much of\\nthe existing research remains focused on specific, narrowly scoped\\napplications. This fragmented approach highlights the need for a more\\ncomprehensive analysis of the potential, challenges, and implications of GenAI\\nintegration within the broader IoT ecosystem. This survey exactly aims to\\naddress this gap by providing a holistic overview of the opportunities, issues,\\nand considerations arising from the convergence of these mainstream paradigms.\\nOur contribution is realized through a systematic literature review following\\nthe PRISMA methodology. A comparison framework is presented, and well-defined\\nresearch questions are outlined to comprehensively explore the past, present,\\nand future directions of GenAI integration with IoT Computing, offering\\nvaluable insights for both experts and newcomers.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:32:18Z\"}"}
