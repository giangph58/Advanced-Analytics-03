In parallel configuration,\\ntwo systems are identically prepared, whereas in antiparallel configuration\\neach system is paired with its spin-flipped counterpart. We demonstrate that\\nthe antiparallel configuration enables exact simultaneous prediction of three\\nmutually orthogonal spin components -- an advantage unattainable in the\\nparallel case. As we show, this enhanced measurement compatibility in\\nantiparallel configuration is better explained within the framework of\\ngeneralized probabilistic theories, which allow a broader class of composite\\nstructures while preserving quantum descriptions at the subsystem level.\\nFurthermore, this approach extends the study of measurement incompatibility to\\nmore general configurations beyond just the parallel and antiparallel cases,\\nproviding deeper insights into the boundary between physical and unphysical\\nquantum state evolutions. To this end, we discuss how the enhanced measurement\\ncompatibility in antiparallel configuration can be observed on a finite\\nensemble of qubit states, paving the way for an experimental demonstration of\\nthis advantage.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:25:44Z\"}"}
