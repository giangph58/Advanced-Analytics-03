However, recent datasets have significantly shifted the bestfit values\\nof relevant $\\\\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters, and thus possibly alter the\\namplitude of lensing B-mode spectrum, which would affect the search for $r$.\\nHere, the joint analysis of Planck and BICEP/Keck data with DESI DR2 reveals\\nthat the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $2.0\\\\sigma$ and $2.1\\\\sigma$ non-zero for\\nPantheonPlus and DES-Y5, respectively, and the bestfit $r$ is $r_{0.05}\\\\simeq\\n0.01$. The results are consistent with those with DESI DR1, but slightly\\nstrengthened. There might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode\\nmeasurements due to the foreground contamination, however, our work is to not\\nsay what about the value of $r$, but emphasize that the detection for $r$ is\\nmodel-dependent and depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe,\\nhighlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our\\nvery early universe.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:08:04Z\"}"}
