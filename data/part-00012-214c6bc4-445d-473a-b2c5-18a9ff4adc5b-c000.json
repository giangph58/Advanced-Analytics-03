If $X$ is a Moishezon variety, then the image of\\n$\\\\mathrm{Bim}(X)$ via such a representation is a finite group by a classical\\nresult due to Deligne and Ueno. We prove that this image is a finite group\\nunder the assumption that for the Kodaira dimension $\\\\kappa(X)$ of $X$ we have\\n$\\\\kappa(X)=\\\\dim X-1$. To this aim, we prove a version of the canonical bundle\\nformula in relative dimension $1$ which works for a proper morphism from a\\ncomplex variety to a projective variety. In particular, this establishes the\\nanalytic version of Prokhorov--Shokurov conjecture in relative dimension $1$.\\nAlso, we observe that the analytic version of this conjecture does not hold in\\nrelative dimension $2$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:45:16Z\"}"}
