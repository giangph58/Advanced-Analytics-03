{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04734v1\", \"title\": \"Teaching Data Science Students to Sketch Privacy Designs through\\n  Heuristics (Extended Technical Report)\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies reveal that experienced data practitioners often draw sketches\\nto facilitate communication around privacy design concepts. However, there is\\nlimited understanding of how we can help novice students develop such\\ncommunication skills. This paper studies methods for lowering novice data\\nscience students' barriers to creating high-quality privacy sketches. We first\\nconducted a need-finding study (N=12) to identify barriers students face when\\nsketching privacy designs. We then used a human-centered design approach to\\nguide the method development, culminating in three simple, text-based\\nheuristics. Our user studies with 24 data science students revealed that simply\\npresenting three heuristics to the participants at the beginning of the study\\ncan enhance the coverage of privacy-related design decisions in sketches,\\nreduce the mental effort required for creating sketches, and improve the\\nreadability of the final sketches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CR,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:12:21Z\"}"}
