In this paper, we extend these\\nfoundational results to the Sturm-Liouville operator on $\\\\mathbb{R}$. In\\nparticular, for autonomous Lagrangian systems, we employ a geometric argument\\nto derive a lower bound for the Morse index. As concrete applications, we\\nestablish a criterion for detecting instability in traveling waves within\\ngradient reaction-diffusion systems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:00:13Z\"}"}
