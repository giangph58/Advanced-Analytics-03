Each level in this hierarchy contributes through the\\nkernel and pseudo-determinant of effective operators, capturing the energy and\\nentropy, respectively. At leading order, the structure coincides with geometric\\nplaquette frustrations, while subleading corrections arise from magnetic\\nadjacency matrices defined on percolated clusters in the dual lattice. Our\\nresults, supported by numerical simulations, provide a systematic framework for\\nanalyzing spin-glass ground states and offer new insight into glass order in\\nfinite dimensions.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:59:02Z\"}"}
