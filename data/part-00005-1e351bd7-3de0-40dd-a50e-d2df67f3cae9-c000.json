{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24341v1\", \"title\": \"Chemically Tuning Room Temperature Pulsed Optically Detected Magnetic\\n  Resonance\", \"summary\": \"Optical detection of magnetic resonance enables spin-based quantum sensing\\nwith high spatial resolution and sensitivity-even at room temperature-as\\nexemplified by solid-state defects. Molecular systems provide a complementary,\\nchemically tunable, platform for room-temperature optically detected magnetic\\nresonance (ODMR)-based quantum sensing. A critical parameter governing sensing\\nsensitivity is the optical contrast-i.e., the difference in emission between\\ntwo spin states. In state-of-the-art solid-state defects such as the\\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, this contrast is approximately 30%. Here,\\ncapitalizing on chemical tunability, we show that room-temperature ODMR\\ncontrasts of 40% can be achieved in molecules. Using a nitrogen-substituted\\nanalogue of pentacene (6,13-diazapentacene), we enhance contrast compared to\\npentacene and, by determining the triplet kinetics through time-dependent\\npulsed ODMR, show how this arises from accelerated anisotropic intersystem\\ncrossing. Furthermore, we translate high-contrast room-temperature pulsed ODMR\\nto self-assembled nanocrystals. Overall, our findings highlight the synthetic\\nhandles available to optically readable molecular spins and the opportunities\\nto capitalize on chemical tunability for room-temperature quantum sensing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:25:46Z\"}"}
