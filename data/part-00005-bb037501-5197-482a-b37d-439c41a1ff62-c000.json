{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05017v1\", \"title\": \"Joint BS Deployment and Power Optimization for Minimum EMF Exposure with\\n  RL in Real-World Based Urban Scenario\", \"summary\": \"Conventional base station (BS) deployments typically prioritize coverage,\\nquality of service (QoS), or cost reduction, often overlooking electromagnetic\\nfield (EMF) exposure. Whereas EMF exposure triggers significant public concern\\ndue to its potential health implications, making it crucial to address when\\ndeploying BS in densely populated areas. To this end, this paper addresses\\nminimizing average EMF exposure while maintaining coverage in a 3D urban\\nscenario by jointly optimizing BS deployment and power. To address this,\\nfirstly, accurate EMF prediction is essential, as traditional empirical models\\nlack the required accuracy, necessitating a deterministic channel model. A\\nnovel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) algorithm is\\ntherefore developed to overcome several limitations of current simulators and\\nis validated with real-world measurements. Secondly, to further reduce\\ncomputational complexity, unlike using a fixed grid size to discretize the\\ntarget area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed with a\\nflexible grid to predict the overall EMF exposure. Finally, based on the EMF\\nexposure predictions, the Nelder-Mead (NM) method is used in the joint\\noptimization, and urban user equipment (UE) distributions are incorporated to\\nbetter reflect real-world conditions. When evaluating the benefits of the whole\\nprocess, the results are compared against using empirical channel models,\\nrevealing notable differences and underestimation of EMF exposure that\\nhighlight the importance of considering real-world scenario.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:41:08Z\"}"}
