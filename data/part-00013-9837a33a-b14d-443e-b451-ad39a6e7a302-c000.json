This paper explores the\\nand experiment with different approaches to using LLMs for analyzing AIS data.\\nWe propose a set of carefully designed queries to assess the reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs in this kind of tasks. Further, we experiment with four\\ndifferent methods: (1) using LLMs as a natural language interface to a spatial\\ndatabase, (2) reasoning on raw data, (3) reasoning on compressed trajectories,\\nand (4) reasoning on semantic trajectories. We investigate the strengths and\\nweaknesses for the four methods, and discuss the findings. The goal is to\\nprovide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners on selecting\\nthe most appropriate LLM-based method depending on their specific data analysis\\nobjectives.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:38:39Z\"}"}
