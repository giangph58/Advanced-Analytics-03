We train a variety of supervised-learning\\nmodels to identify 20 iconic jazz musicians across a carefully curated dataset\\nof 84 hours of recordings, and interpret their decision-making processes. Our\\nmodels include a novel multi-input architecture that enables four musical\\ndomains (melody, harmony, rhythm, and dynamics) to be analysed separately.\\nThese models enable us to address fundamental questions in music theory and\\nalso advance the state-of-the-art in music performer identification (94%\\naccuracy across 20 classes). We release open-source implementations of our\\nmodels and an accompanying web application for exploring musical styles.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,cs.IR,cs.LG,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:37:39Z\"}"}
