{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01874v1\", \"title\": \"The Hitchin morphism for certain surfaces fibered over a curve\", \"summary\": \"The Chen-Ng\\\\^o Conjecture predicts that the Hitchin morphism from the moduli\\nstack of $G$-Higgs bundles on a smooth projective variety surjects onto the\\nspace of spectral data. The conjecture is known to hold for the group $GL_n$\\nand any surface, and for the group $GL_2$ and any smooth projective variety. We\\nprove the Chen-Ng\\\\^o Conjecture for any reductive group when the variety is a\\nruled surface or (a blowup of) a nonisotrivial elliptic fibration with reduced\\nfibers. Furthermore, if the group is a classical group, i.e. $G \\\\in\\n\\\\{SL_n,SO_n,Sp_{2n}\\\\}$, then we prove the Hitchin morphism restricted to the\\nDolbeault moduli space of semiharmonic $G$-Higgs bundles surjects onto the\\nspace of spectral data.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:30:25Z\"}"}
