The model under\\ninvestigation was derived from a stochastic system of interacting particles\\ndescribing a foraging ant colony coupled to pheromone dynamics. In this work,\\nwe prove that the unique numerical solution converges to the unique weak\\nsolution as the mesh size and the time step go to zero. We also show discrete\\nlong-time estimates, which prove that certain norms are preserved for all\\ntimes, uniformly in the mesh size and time step. In particular, we prove higher\\nregularity estimates which provide an analogue of continuum parabolic higher\\nregularity estimates. Finally, we numerically study the rate of convergence of\\nthe scheme, and we provide examples of the existence of multiple metastable\\nsteady states.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:23:49Z\"}"}
