This construction leads to new and potentially\\nrich cosmological phenomenology. After a concise recap of the standard\\nquintessence scenario, we highlight how a $U(1)$ gauge invariance alters the\\ndynamics of the scalar and the associated dark gauge boson. We survey the\\nevolution of both fields across cosmic history, discuss their possible\\nproduction via a misalignment mechanism, and examine implications for the\\nHubble tension. We also comment on potential non-gravitational signals of\\ngauged quintessence through kinetic mixing (the dark photon vector portal).\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:21:33Z\"}"}
