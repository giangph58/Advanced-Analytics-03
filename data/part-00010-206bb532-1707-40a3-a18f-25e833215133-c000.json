{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02561v1\", \"title\": \"Digital Twins for Internet of Battlespace Things (IoBT) Coalitions\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a new framework for integrating Digital Twins (DTs)\\nwithin Internet of battlespace Things (IoBT) coalitions. We introduce a novel\\nthree-tier architecture that enables efficient coordination and management of\\nDT models across coalition partners while addressing key challenges in\\ninteroperability, security, and resource allocation. The architecture comprises\\nspecialized controllers at each tier: Digital Twin Coalition Partner (DTCP)\\ncontrollers managing individual coalition partners' DT resources, a central\\nDigital Twin Coalition(DTC) controller orchestrating cross-partner\\ncoordination, and Digital Twin Coalition Mission (DTCP) controllers handling\\nmission-specific DT interactions. We propose a hybrid approach for DT model\\nplacement across edge devices, tactical nodes, and cloud infrastructure,\\noptimizing performance while maintaining security and accessibility. The\\narchitecture leverages software-defined networking principles for dynamic\\nresource allocation and slice management, enabling efficient sharing of\\ncomputational and network resources between DT operations and primary IoBT\\nfunctions. Our proposed framework aims to provide a robust foundation for\\ndeploying and managing Digital Twins in coalition warfare, enhancing\\nsituational awareness, decision-making capabilities, and operational\\neffectiveness while ensuring secure and interoperable operations across diverse\\ncoalition partners.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:23:44Z\"}"}
