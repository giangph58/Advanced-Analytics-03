In this work, I present\\na new method to derive such quantities for weakly driven processes in the\\noverdamped regime for any switching time. The white noise Brownian motion in a\\nharmonic linear stiffening trap illustrates the result. The work probability\\ndistribution is non-tabulated, with positive, semi-finite support, diverging at\\nthe minimal value, and non-Gaussian. An analysis of the range of validity of\\nlinear response is made by using the self-consistent criterion of the\\nfluctuation-dissipation relation. The first, second, third, and fourth moments\\nare correctly calculated for small perturbations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:18:35Z\"}"}
