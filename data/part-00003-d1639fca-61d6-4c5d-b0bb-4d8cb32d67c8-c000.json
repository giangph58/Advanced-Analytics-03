The\\nmain result of this paper is the existence of the Poincar\\\\'e-Lindstedt series\\nto all orders for the bifurcating periodic solutions. The model has a\\nnon-linearity which is non-polynomial, and yet this allows us to exploit the\\nuse of Fourier-Taylor series to develop order-by-order calculations that lead\\nto linear recurrence equations for the coefficients of the Poincar\\\\'e-Lindstedt\\nseries. As applications, we implement the computation of the coefficients of\\nthese series for any finite order, and use a pseudo-arclength continuation to\\ncompute branches of periodic solutions.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T03:13:38Z\"}"}
