{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02500v1\", \"title\": \"An Overview of Josephson Junctions Based QPUs\", \"summary\": \"Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions\\npromise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical\\nchallenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead\\nhinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these\\nissues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical\\nengineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as\\nsuperposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of\\nsuperconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair\\nformation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail.\\nAdditionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures,\\nincluding ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique\\nadvantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings\\nemphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control\\ntechniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence\\nand for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cs.ET,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:26:52Z\"}"}
