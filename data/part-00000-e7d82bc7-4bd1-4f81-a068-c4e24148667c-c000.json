To\\nprecisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum\\nFisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a\\nlower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales\\nas $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both\\nat the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic\\nlimit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting\\nin this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced\\nprecision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that,\\nin contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and\\nachieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\\\\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA\\ninteraction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between\\nnon-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is\\nmoderate.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:19:31Z\"}"}
