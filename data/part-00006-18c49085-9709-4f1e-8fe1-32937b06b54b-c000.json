A Conceptual Framework for Individuals to\\n  Ascertain Fairness\", \"summary\": \"Current fairness metrics and mitigation techniques provide tools for\\npractitioners to asses how non-discriminatory Automatic Decision Making (ADM)\\nsystems are. What if I, as an individual facing a decision taken by an ADM\\nsystem, would like to know: Am I being treated fairly? We explore how to create\\nthe affordance for users to be able to ask this question of ADM. In this paper,\\nwe argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but\\nalso as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the\\ndecisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek\\neffective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be\\ndiscriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in\\nalgorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence,\\naccountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we\\npropose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different\\ntools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus\\nfrom technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable\\nindividuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and\\nalso serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap\\nbetween technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.HC,cs.LG,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:28:19Z\"}"}
