{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23852v1\", \"title\": \"Multispacecraft Observations of the 2024 September 9 Backside Solar\\n  Eruption that Resulted in a Sustained Gamma Ray Emission Event\", \"summary\": \"We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event\\nobserved by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was\\nassociated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such\\nas the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations\\nObservatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar\\nDynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio\\ntelescopes. SolO Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an\\nintense flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from\\nheliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope\\nrevealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km s^{-2}) to attain a peak\\nspeed of 2162 km s^{-1}. SolO energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed\\nprotons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a\\ncomplex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and\\ntype II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities\\nobtained from longer duration (exceeding 3 hours) SGRE events. All these\\nobservations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux\\nrope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE\\nevent. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that\\nthey are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a\\nsignificant east west asymmetry in the BTL source locations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:56:13Z\"}"}
