{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06201v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum Annealing for Combinatorial Optimization: A Benchmarking Study\", \"summary\": \"Quantum annealing (QA) has the potential to significantly improve solution\\nquality and reduce time complexity in solving combinatorial optimization\\nproblems compared to classical optimization methods. However, due to the\\nlimited number of qubits and their connectivity, the QA hardware did not show\\nsuch an advantage over classical methods in past benchmarking studies. Recent\\nadvancements in QA with more than 5,000 qubits, enhanced qubit connectivity,\\nand the hybrid architecture promise to realize the quantum advantage. Here, we\\nuse a quantum annealer with state-of-the-art techniques and benchmark its\\nperformance against classical solvers. To compare their performance, we solve\\nover 50 optimization problem instances represented by large and dense\\nHamiltonian matrices using quantum and classical solvers. The results\\ndemonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum solver has higher accuracy\\n(~0.013%) and a significantly faster problem-solving time (~6,561x) than the\\nbest classical solver. Our results highlight the advantages of leveraging QA\\nover classical counterparts, particularly in hybrid configurations, for\\nachieving high accuracy and substantially reduced problem solving time in\\nlarge-scale real-world optimization problems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:43:24Z\"}"}
