Despite improvements in efficiency\\nover traditional taxi services, significant challenges remain, including\\ndrivers' strategic repositioning behavior, customer abandonment, and\\ninefficiencies in dispatch algorithms. To address these issues, we introduce a\\ncomprehensive mean field game model that systematically analyzes the dynamics\\nof ride-hailing platforms by incorporating driver repositioning across multiple\\nregions, customer abandonment behavior, and platform dispatch algorithms. Using\\nthis framework, we identify all possible mean field equilibria as the\\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of an associated optimization problem. Our\\nanalysis reveals the emergence of multiple equilibria, including the\\ninefficient \\\"Wild Goose Chase\\\" one, characterized by drivers pursuing distant\\nrequests, leading to suboptimal system performance. To mitigate these\\ninefficiencies, we propose a novel two-matching-radius nearest-neighbor\\ndispatch algorithm that eliminates undesirable equilibria and ensures a unique\\nmean field equilibrium for multi-region systems. The algorithm dynamically\\nadjusts matching radii based on driver supply rates, optimizing pick-up times\\nand waiting times for drivers while maximizing request completion rates.\\nNumerical experiments and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm\\nreduces customer abandonment, minimizes waiting times for both customers and\\ndrivers, and improves overall platform efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:31:08Z\"}"}
