As part of the launch of the project Reducing Noise\\nwith Augmented Reality (ReNAR); which aims to create a tool to reduce in\\nreal-time the cognitive impact of sounds perceived as unpleasant or annoying in\\nindoor environments; an initial study was conducted to validate the feasibility\\nand effectiveness of a new masking approach called concealer. The main\\nhypothesis is that the concealer approach could provide better results than a\\nmasker approach in terms of perceived pleasantness. Mixtures of two noise\\nsources (ventilation) and five masking sounds (water sounds) were generated\\nusing both approaches at various levels. The evaluation of the perceived\\npleasantness of these mixtures showed that the masker approach remains more\\neffective than the concealer approach, regardless of the noise source, water\\nsound, or level used.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SD\", \"categories\": \"cs.SD,eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:27:07Z\"}"}
