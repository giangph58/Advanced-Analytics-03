Intrusive model order reduction techniques exhibit high\\naccuracy levels, however, they are rarely used as a standalone industrial tool,\\nbecause of the required high level knowledge involved in the construction and\\nusage of these techniques. Moreover, the computation time benefit is\\ncompromised for highly nonlinear problems. On the other hand, non-intrusive\\nmethods often struggle with accuracy in nonlinear cases, typically requiring a\\nlarge design of experiment and a large number of snapshots achieve a reliable\\nperformance. However, generating the stiffness matrix in a non-intrusive\\napproach presents an optimal way to align accuracy with efficiency, allying the\\nadvantages of both intrusive and non-intrusive methods.This work introduces a\\nlightly intrusive model order reduction technique that employs machine learning\\nwithin a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition framework to achieve this alliance. By\\nleveraging outputs from commercial full-order models, this method constructs a\\nreduced-order model that operates effectively without requiring expert user\\nintervention. The proposed technique has the possibility to approximate linear\\nnon affine as well as non linear terms. It is showcased for linear and\\nnonlinear structural mechanics problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:11:05Z\"}"}
