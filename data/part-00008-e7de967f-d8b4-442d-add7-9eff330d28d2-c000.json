The multiphase model, consisting of solid and\\nliquid phases, is written as a convection-reaction system with a\\nCahn-Hilliard-type equation with degenerate mobility coupled to a Stokes-flow\\nequation for the mixture velocity. An upwind discontinuous Galerkin approach is\\nused to approximate the convection-reaction equations, whereas an\\n$H^1$-conforming primal formulation is proposed for the Stokes system. By means\\nof a splitting procedure due to the reaction terms, an invariant-region\\nprinciple is shown for the concentration unknowns, namely non-negativity for\\nall phases and an upper bound for the total concentration of the solid phases.\\nNumerical examples with reduced biofilm reactions are presented to illustrate\\nthe performance of the model and numerical scheme.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:10:06Z\"}"}
