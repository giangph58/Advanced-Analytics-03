We report\\nLick/KAIT observations of GRB 170519A, and make temporal analysis and spectral\\njoint fits of its multiwavelength light curves. The observations present a\\nrelatively complete afterglow structure, including two X-ray flares (Flares I\\nand II), optical onset (Slice 1), normal decay (Slices 2 and 3), and a possible\\njet break. The spectrum of the bright X-ray flare (Flare II) indicates that a\\nthermal component exists at $t = 190$--240~s. \\\\textbf{The blackbody emits in\\nthe photospheric radius $R_{\\\\rm ph}\\\\sim 10^{11}$ cm,} and its temperature\\n($kT$) decreases with time from \\\\textbf{1.08 to 0.37 keV, its Lorentz factor of\\nblackbody ($\\\\Gamma_{\\\\rm BB}$) decreases with time from 67.71 to 46.70. The\\nluminosity of the blackbody ($L_{\\\\rm BB}$), $kT$ and $\\\\Gamma_{\\\\rm BB}$ follow\\nthe relations $\\\\bf L_{\\\\rm BB} \\\\propto kT^{2.49\\\\pm 0.03}$ and $\\\\Gamma_{\\\\rm\\nBB}\\\\propto L_{\\\\rm BB}^{0.27}$ (estimated from \\\\cite{fan2012}).} In the optical\\nlight curves, there is an onset bump in the early-time afterglow, rising with\\nan index $\\\\alpha_{O,1} \\\\approx -0.43$ and peaking $\\\\sim1174.9$ s since the BAT\\ntrigger. The bump then decays with $\\\\bf \\\\alpha_{O,2} \\\\approx 0.88$ in the\\nnormal decay phase, and the X-ray flux decays with a similar index of $\\\\bf\\n\\\\alpha_{X,1} \\\\approx 0.95$. There is no obvious spectral evolution in the\\nnormal decay phases, with photon index $\\\\hat{\\\\Gamma} = 1.86$ and 1.92 in Slices\\n2 and 3, respectively. We find that the multiwavelength light curves of the GRB\\n170519A afterglow can be well fitted by an external shock with time-dependent\\n$\\\\epsilon_B$. In the early afterglow, the value of $\\\\epsilon_B$ decays rapidly\\nfrom $\\\\bf 4.29\\\\times10^{-2}$ to $\\\\bf 8.23\\\\times10^{-3}$.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:26:09Z\"}"}
