{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01485v1\", \"title\": \"Diameter Shortcut Sets on Temporal Graphs\", \"summary\": \"Shortcut sets are a vital instrument for reducing the diameter of a static\\ngraph and, consequently, its shortest path complexity, which is relevant in\\nnumerous subfields of graph theory. We explore the notion of shortcut sets in\\ntemporal graphs, which incorporate a discrete time model into the graph,\\nrendering each edge accessible exclusively at specific points in time. This not\\nonly alters the underlying assumptions of regular graphs but also substantially\\nincreases the complexity of path problems and reachability. In turn, a temporal\\ngraph is often a much more realistic and accurate representation of a\\nreal-world network. In this thesis we provide a definition for a shortcut set\\nin a temporal graph and explore differences to classic shortcut sets. Utilizing\\nthis definition, we show that temporal and regular shortcut sets yield the same\\nresults on temporal paths, enabling the application of existing construction\\nalgorithms for static shortcut sets on paths. The primary contribution of this\\nthesis is a translation approach for general temporal graphs that utilizes the\\nstatic expansion of a temporal graph, allowing the conversion of static\\nshortcut sets into temporal shortcut sets, yielding similar results.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:38:21Z\"}"}
