The Internet of Medical Things\\n(IoMT), an advanced extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) tailored for the\\nmedical field, offers a transformative solution for delivering medical care.\\nIoMT consists of interconnected medical devices that collect and transmit\\npatients' vital signs online. This data can be analyzed to identify potential\\nhealth issues, support medical decision-making, enhance patient outcomes, and\\nstreamline healthcare operations. Additionally, IoMT helps individuals make\\ninformed decisions about their health and fitness. There is a natural synergy\\nwith emerging communication technologies to ensure the secure and timely\\ntransmission of medical data. This paper presents the first comprehensive\\ntutorial on cutting-edge IoMT research focusing on wireless communication-based\\nsolutions. It introduces a systematic three-tier framework to analyze IoMT\\nnetworks and identify application scenarios. The paper examines the medical\\ndata transmission process, including intra-wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN),\\ninter-WBAN, and beyond-WBAN communications. It also discusses the challenges of\\nimplementing IoMT applications, such as the longevity of biosensors, co-channel\\ninterference management, information security, and data processing delays.\\nProposed solutions to these challenges are explored from a wireless\\ncommunication perspective, and future research directions are outlined. The\\nsurvey concludes with a summary of key findings and insights.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:00:42Z\"}"}
