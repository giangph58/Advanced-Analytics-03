From the first ESA\\nastrometric mission HIPPARCOS of the early 80s to the current Gaia mission, the\\ndata volume and computational complexity of the full reduction process has\\nincreased by several orders of magnitude, requiring high-performance computing\\nand data throughput. We review the principles and computational complexity of\\ngeneral global astrometric models that lead to the statistical treatment of an\\nextra-large, highly non-linear estimation problem. Some numerical aspects of\\ninspecting Gaia's proper motions to find cosmological signals at all scales are\\nalso addressed.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:58:40Z\"}"}
