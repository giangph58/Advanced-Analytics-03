{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01750v1\", \"title\": \"Probing the Distance Duality Relation with Machine Learning and Recent\\n  Data\", \"summary\": \"The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring\\ncosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity\\ndistance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and\\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1,\\nPantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We\\nemploy a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic\\nAlgorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve\\nloosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data\\nwithout Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a\\n$2\\\\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add\\nhigh-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This\\nreflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard\\ncosmological model $\\\\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation\\nof the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\\\\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe\\nIa data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent\\napproach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation\\nwith BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\\\\sigma$. This shows the importance of\\nconsidering model-independent approaches for the DDR.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:02:12Z\"}"}
