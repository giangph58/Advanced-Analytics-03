The choice of global\\nvariant has significant consequences when spacetime is taken to be\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\times S^1$. We focus on $\\\\mathcal N=1^*$ theories, which are\\nclosely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We establish, on\\ngeneral grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on\\nthe integrable system side by introducing a notion of global variants for\\ncomplex many-body integrable systems associated with Lie algebras. Focusing on\\n$\\\\mathcal N=1^*$ theories of type $A$ and $B_2$, we elucidate the implications\\nfor the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries\\nrealized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular\\ninvariance.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:54:40Z\"}"}
