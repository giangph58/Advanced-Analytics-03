{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04859v1\", \"title\": \"Block BDDC/FETI-DP Preconditioners for Three-Field mixed finite element\\n  Discretizations of Biot's consolidation model\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we construct and analyze a block dual-primal preconditioner\\nfor Biot's consolidation model approximated by three-field mixed finite\\nelements based on a displacement, pressure, and total pressure formulation. The\\ndomain is decomposed into nonoverlapping subdomains, and the continuity of the\\ndisplacement component across the subdomain interface is enforced by\\nintroducing a Lagrange multiplier. After eliminating all displacement variables\\nand the independent subdomain interior components of pressure and total\\npressure, the problem is reduced to a symmetric positive definite linear system\\nfor the subdomain interface pressure, total pressure, and the Lagrange\\nmultiplier. This reduced system is solved by a preconditioned conjugate\\ngradient method, with a block dual-primal preconditioner using a Balancing\\nDomain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner for both the\\ninterface total pressure block and the interface pressure blocks, as well as a\\nFinite Element Tearing and Interconnecting-Dual Primal (FETI-DP) preconditioner\\nfor the Lagrange multiplier block. By analyzing the conditioning of the\\npreconditioned subsystem associated with the interface pressure and total\\npressure components, we obtain a condition number bound of the preconditioned\\nsystem, which is scalable in the number of subdomains, poly-logarithmic in the\\nratio of subdomain and mesh sizes, and robust with respect to the parameters of\\nthe model. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the theoretical result of\\nthe proposed algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:17:37Z\"}"}
