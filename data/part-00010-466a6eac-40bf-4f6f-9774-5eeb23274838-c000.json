{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06153v1\", \"title\": \"A Large-Scale Analysis on Contextual Self-Supervised Video\\n  Representation Learning\", \"summary\": \"Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for label-free\\nmodel pretraining, particularly in the video domain, where manual annotation is\\ncostly and time-intensive. However, existing self-supervised approaches employ\\ndiverse experimental setups, making direct comparisons challenging due to the\\nabsence of a standardized benchmark. In this work, we establish a unified\\nbenchmark that enables fair comparisons across different methods. Additionally,\\nwe systematically investigate five critical aspects of self-supervised learning\\nin videos: (1) dataset size, (2) model complexity, (3) data distribution, (4)\\ndata noise, and (5) feature representations. To facilitate this study, we\\nevaluate six self-supervised learning methods across six network architectures,\\nconducting extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and assessing\\nperformance on two distinct downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals key insights\\ninto the interplay between pretraining strategies, dataset characteristics,\\npretext tasks, and model architectures. Furthermore, we extend these findings\\nto Video Foundation Models (ViFMs), demonstrating their relevance in\\nlarge-scale video representation learning. Finally, leveraging these insights,\\nwe propose a novel approach that significantly reduces training data\\nrequirements while surpassing state-of-the-art methods that rely on 10% more\\npretraining data. We believe this work will guide future research toward a\\ndeeper understanding of self-supervised video representation learning and its\\nbroader implications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:47:58Z\"}"}
