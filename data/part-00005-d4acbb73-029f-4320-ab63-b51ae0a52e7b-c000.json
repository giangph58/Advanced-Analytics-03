Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement\\nby introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir\\nof the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing\\ntransformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized\\noptomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling\\nstrength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled\\nto an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the\\nentanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By\\nevaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the\\noptomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr\\nconstant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region,\\nenabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue sideband-parameter\\nregion. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on\\nthe average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical\\ndriving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity\\nallows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal\\nphonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will\\nprovide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum\\nsystems.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:55:12Z\"}"}
