{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05080v1\", \"title\": \"Online Gaussian elimination for quantum LDPC decoding\", \"summary\": \"Decoders for quantum LDPC codes generally rely on solving a parity-check\\nequation with Gaussian elimination, with the generalised union-find decoder\\nperforming this repeatedly on growing clusters. We present an online variant of\\nthe Gaussian elimination algorithm which maintains an LUP decomposition in\\norder to process only new rows and columns as they are added to a system of\\nequations. This is equivalent to performing Gaussian elimination once on the\\nfinal system of equations, in contrast to the multiple rounds of Gaussian\\nelimination employed by the generalised union-find decoder. It thus\\nsignificantly reduces the number of operations performed by the decoder. We\\nconsider the generalised union-find decoder as an example use case and present\\na complexity analysis demonstrating that both variants take time cubic in the\\nnumber of qubits in the general case, but that the number of operations\\nperformed by the online variant is lower by an amount which itself scales\\ncubically. This analysis is also extended to the regime of 'well-behaved' codes\\nin which the number of growth iterations required is bounded logarithmically in\\nerror weight. Finally, we show empirically that our online variant outperforms\\nthe original offline decoder in average-case time complexity on codes with\\nsparser parity-check matrices or greater covering radius.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:49:00Z\"}"}
