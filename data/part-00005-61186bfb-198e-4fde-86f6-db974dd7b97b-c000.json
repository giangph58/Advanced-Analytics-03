To address this limitation, we propose a\\nself-supervised pretraining method that improves segmentation performance while\\nreducing reliance on labeled data. Our approach uses inpainting-based\\npretraining, where the model learns to reconstruct missing regions in aerial\\nimages, capturing their inherent structure before being fine-tuned for road\\nextraction. This method improves generalization, enhances robustness to domain\\nshifts, and is invariant to model architecture and dataset choice. Experiments\\nshow that our pretraining significantly boosts segmentation accuracy,\\nespecially in low-data regimes, making it a scalable solution for aerial image\\nanalysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:14:08Z\"}"}
