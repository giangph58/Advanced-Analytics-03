Mental arithmetic is not limited to numerical calculation; one\\ncan mentally calculate primitives and simplify analytical expressions. Even if\\nthere is software that does this very well, this training retains its\\npedagogical value. Can we go further and consider geometric mental arithmetic:\\nmentally proceeding with transformations of simple figures allowing the\\ncalculation of areas or volumes? It turns out that the intuition that allowed\\nArchimedes to obtain his main geometric results, if we take only the ideas\\nwithout the old-fashioned style, provides the opportunity for a pleasant and\\nquite rich mental game that I present here in the form of a short narrative\\ndialogue, not a philosophical tale because it does not bring any thesis, simply\\na story to be classified among the invitations to exercise the mind. It starts\\nwith the area of a triangle and ends with Guldin's two theorems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.HO\", \"categories\": \"math.HO,math.MG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:39:13Z\"}"}
