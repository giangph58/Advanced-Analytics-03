{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07927v1\", \"title\": \"Zero-Shot Low-dose CT Denoising via Sinogram Flicking\", \"summary\": \"Many low-dose CT imaging methods rely on supervised learning, which requires\\na large number of paired noisy and clean images. However, obtaining paired\\nimages in clinical practice is challenging. To address this issue, zero-shot\\nself-supervised methods train denoising networks using only the information\\nwithin a single image, such as ZS-N2N. However, these methods often employ\\ndownsampling operations that degrade image resolution. Additionally, the\\ntraining dataset is inherently constrained to the image itself. In this paper,\\nwe propose a zero-shot low-dose CT imaging method based on sinogram flicking,\\nwhich operates within a single image but generates many copies via random\\nconjugate ray matching. Specifically, two conjugate X-ray pencil beams measure\\nthe same path; their expected values should be identical, while their noise\\nlevels vary during measurements. By randomly swapping portions of the conjugate\\nX-rays in the sinogram domain, we generate a large set of sinograms with\\nconsistent content but varying noise patterns. When displayed dynamically,\\nthese sinograms exhibit a flickering effect due to their identical structural\\ncontent but differing noise patterns-hence the term sinogram flicking. We train\\nthe network on pairs of sinograms with the same content but different noise\\ndistributions using a lightweight model adapted from ZS-NSN. This process is\\nrepeated to obtain the final results. A simulation study demonstrates that our\\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as ZS-N2N.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:42:01Z\"}"}
