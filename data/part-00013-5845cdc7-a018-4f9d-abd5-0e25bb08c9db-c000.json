Detecting the global spectrum of redshifted 21-cm signals is\\ntypically achieved through single-antenna experiments. However, this global\\n21-cm signal is deeply embedded in foreground emissions, which are about four\\norders of magnitude stronger. Extracting this faint signal is a significant\\nchallenge, requiring highly precise instrumental calibration. Additionally,\\naccurately modelling receiver noise in single-antenna experiments is inherently\\ncomplex. An alternative approach using a short-spacing interferometer is\\nexpected to alleviate these difficulties because the noise in different\\nreceivers is uncorrelated and averages to zero upon cross-correlation. The\\nShort-spacing Interferometer array for Global 21-cm Signal detection (SIGMA) is\\nan upcoming experiment aimed at detecting the global CD/EoR signal using this\\napproach. We describe the SIGMA system with a focus on optimal antenna design\\nand layout, and propose a framework to address cross-talk between antennas in\\nfuture calibrations. The SIGMA system is intended to serve as a prototype to\\ngain a better understanding of the system's instrumental effects and to\\noptimize its performance further.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:42:30Z\"}"}
