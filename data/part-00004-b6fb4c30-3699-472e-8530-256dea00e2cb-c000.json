However, the\\nfinite element method is usually incorporated into a high-level numerical\\nscheme which allows the adaptive refinement of the mesh on which the solution\\nis approximated. In this work, we propose to extend adaptive mesh refinement to\\nthe quantum formalism, and apply our method to the resolution of Maxwell's\\nequations. An important step in this procedure is the computation of error\\nestimators, which guide the refinement. By using block-encoding, we propose a\\nway to compute these estimators with quantum circuits. We present first\\nnumerical experiments on a 2D geometry.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:54:24Z\"}"}
