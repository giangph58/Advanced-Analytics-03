{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01342v1\", \"title\": \"Foundations and Evaluations in NLP\", \"summary\": \"This memoir explores two fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing\\n(NLP): the creation of linguistic resources and the evaluation of NLP system\\nperformance. Over the past decade, my work has focused on developing a\\nmorpheme-based annotation scheme for the Korean language that captures\\nlinguistic properties from morphology to semantics. This approach has achieved\\nstate-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech\\ntagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. Additionally, this\\nwork provides a comprehensive analysis of segmentation granularity and its\\ncritical impact on NLP system performance. In parallel with linguistic resource\\ndevelopment, I have proposed a novel evaluation framework, the jp-algorithm,\\nwhich introduces an alignment-based method to address challenges in\\npreprocessing tasks like tokenization and sentence boundary detection (SBD).\\nTraditional evaluation methods assume identical tokenization and sentence\\nlengths between gold standards and system outputs, limiting their applicability\\nto real-world data. The jp-algorithm overcomes these limitations, enabling\\nrobust end-to-end evaluations across a variety of NLP tasks. It enhances\\naccuracy and flexibility by incorporating linear-time alignment while\\npreserving the complexity of traditional evaluation metrics. This memoir\\nprovides key insights into the processing of morphologically rich languages,\\nsuch as Korean, while offering a generalizable framework for evaluating diverse\\nend-to-end NLP systems. My contributions lay the foundation for future\\ndevelopments, with broader implications for multilingual resource development\\nand system evaluation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T04:14:03Z\"}"}
