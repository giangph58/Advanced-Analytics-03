In total, the task received more than 100 submissions. The\\nparticipants experimented mainly with large language models in zero-shot,\\nfew-shot and fine-tuning formats. The best result on the test set was obtained\\nwith fine-tuning of a large language model. We also compared 30 prompts and 11\\nopen source language models with 3-32 billion parameters in the 1-shot and\\n10-shot settings and found the best models and prompts.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,I.2.7\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:54:00Z\"}"}
