For example, the profinite direct sum of projective modules is\\nprojective, and there is a Mackey's Formula for profinite modules described\\nusing these sums. As an application, we prove that the class of profinite\\ngroups of type $\\\\Phi_R$ is closed under subgroups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.CT,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:28:51Z\"}"}
