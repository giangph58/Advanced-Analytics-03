At its core, differentiable rendering enables the\\ncomputation of gradients with respect to scene parameters, allowing\\noptimization-based approaches to solve various problems. Over the past few\\nyears, significant advancements have been made in both the underlying theory\\nand the practical implementations of differentiable rendering algorithms. In\\nthis report, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the\\nart in physics-based differentiable rendering, focusing on recent advances in\\ngeneral differentiable rendering theory, Monte Carlo sampling strategy, and\\ncomputational efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:39:50Z\"}"}
