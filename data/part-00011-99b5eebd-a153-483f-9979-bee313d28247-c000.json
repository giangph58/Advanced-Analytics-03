Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying\\naffordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense.\\nHowever, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their\\nability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for\\nautomatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process\\ninvolves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol\\nnetwork using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating\\naffordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an\\nexample demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent\\naffordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed\\nsymbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret\\naffordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and\\nhuman-like situational understanding.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:48:44Z\"}"}
