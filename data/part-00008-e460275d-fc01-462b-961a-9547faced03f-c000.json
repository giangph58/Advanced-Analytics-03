Consequently, the capacity of quantum\\ndevices to amplify the privacy of a weak source of randomness, in cases\\nunattainable by classical methods, constitutes a practical advantage. One of\\nthe theoretical models of such weak sources are the so-called Santha-Vazirani\\n(SV) sources; however, finding natural sources satisfying the SV model is a\\nparamount challenge. In this article, we take three significant steps on the\\nway to simplify this hard task. We begin with an in-depth analysis of the\\nmathematical background for estimating the quality of a weak randomness source\\nby providing a set of axioms that systematize the possible approaches to such\\nestimation. We then develop software (SVTest) to estimate the parameter\\ncharacterizing the source's randomness. The software is general-purpose, i.e.,\\nit can test the randomness of any target sequence of bits. Later, we apply the\\nsoftware to test seismic events (earthquakes and local noise) as potential\\nsources of randomness. Our results demonstrate that seismic phenomena are\\npossible sources of randomness, depending on the choice of discretization.\\nTherefore, our work provides strong evidence of the potential of geophysical\\nphenomena as a source of cryptographic resources, building an unprecedented\\nbridge between both fields.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:58:34Z\"}"}
