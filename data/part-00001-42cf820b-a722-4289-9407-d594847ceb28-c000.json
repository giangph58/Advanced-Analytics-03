The proof introduces a novel sequence of\\nincreasingly precise commutator estimates incorporating multiple layers of\\nlogarithmic corrections. We establish the existence of a critical threshold\\nfunction $\\\\Phi(s,q,\\\\{\\\\delta_j\\\\}_{j=1}^n)$ that completely characterizes the\\nboundary between global regularity and potential singularity formation, with\\nexplicit asymptotics as $s$ approaches the critical value $1/2$. This paper\\nfurther provides a rigorous geometric characterization of potential singular\\nstructures through refined multi-fractal analysis, showing that any singular\\nset must have Hausdorff dimension bounded by $1 - \\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\n\\\\frac{\\\\delta_j}{1+\\\\delta_j} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{j+1}$. Our results constitute a\\nsignificant advancement toward resolving the global regularity question for the\\nNavier-Stokes equations, as we demonstrate that with properly calibrated\\nsequences of nested logarithmic improvements, the gap to the critical case can\\nbe systematically reduced.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:55:30Z\"}"}
