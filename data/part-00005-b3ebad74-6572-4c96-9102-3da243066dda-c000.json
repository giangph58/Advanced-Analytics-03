While advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a highly\\npromising solution, enabling AI to emulate human-like scientific discovery\\nremains an open challenge. To address this, we propose AI-Newton, a\\nconcept-driven discovery system capable of autonomously deriving physical laws\\nfrom raw data -- without supervision or prior physical knowledge. The system\\nintegrates a knowledge base and knowledge representation centered on physical\\nconcepts, along with an autonomous discovery workflow. As a proof of concept,\\nwe apply AI-Newton to a large set of Newtonian mechanics problems. Given\\nexperimental data with noise, the system successfully rediscovers fundamental\\nlaws, including Newton's second law, energy conservation and law of\\ngravitation, using autonomously defined concepts. This achievement marks a\\nsignificant step toward AI-driven autonomous scientific discovery.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.SC,hep-ph,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:25:34Z\"}"}
