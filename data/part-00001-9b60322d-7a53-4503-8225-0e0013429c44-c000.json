The two popular\\nframeworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard\\nmodel effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory\\n(HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new\\nphysics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry\\nbreaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken\\nsymmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a\\nsinglet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase\\neffective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate\\nfields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear\\nrealization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our\\napproach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level,\\nwe compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector\\nboson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung\\nprocess at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT\\nreproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the\\nregions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the\\nelectroweak scale. Therefore, the bEFT serves as a useful framework that can\\ncompensate for the shortcomings in both the SMEFT and the HEFT when dealing\\nwith UV models that involve Higgs mixing or new particles with a mass close to\\nthe electroweak scale.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:42:49Z\"}"}
