Unlike the majority of the literature on\\ntreatment effects in linear factor models, our approach does not require the\\nnumber of pre-treatment periods to go to infinity to obtain a valid estimator.\\nOur identification approach employs a certain nonlinear transformations of the\\ntime invariant observed covariates that are sufficiently correlated with the\\nunobserved variables. This relevance condition can be checked with the\\navailable data on pre-treatment periods by validating the correlation of the\\ntransformed covariates and the pre-treatment outcomes. Based on our\\nidentification approach, we provide an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the\\neffect of participating in the treatment when there is only one treated unit\\nand the number of control units is large.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.EM\", \"categories\": \"econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:58:17Z\"}"}
