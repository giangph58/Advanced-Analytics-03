{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06770v1\", \"title\": \"Measuring and predicting galaxy assembly bias across galaxy samples\", \"summary\": \"One of the most important effects shaping small-scale galaxy clustering is\\ngalaxy assembly bias, which refers to the dependence of galaxy clustering on\\nhalo properties. We investigate this effect using galaxy samples selected\\naccording to stellar mass, r-band magnitude, and broad-band colors from the\\nlargest hydrodynamical simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We find that\\ngalaxy assembly bias depends strongly upon the selection criteria, number\\ndensity, and redshift of the sample, increasing or decreasing the clustering by\\nas much as 25%. Interestingly, no single secondary halo property fully captures\\nthe strength of this effect for any galaxy population. Therefore, empirical\\napproaches modeling galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo\\nproperty cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. We then\\nstudy how galaxy assembly bias emerges from the interplay of halo assembly bias\\n-- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than mass -- and\\noccupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary\\nhalo properties -- and provide an analytical expression that predicts the\\namount of galaxy assembly bias caused by any halo property. This expression\\nfacilitates understanding the dependence of galaxy assembly bias on halo\\nproperties and enables the straightforward incorporation of this effect into\\nhalo model approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T10:48:08Z\"}"}
