{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01408v1\", \"title\": \"From Shadows to Safety: Occlusion Tracking and Risk Mitigation for Urban\\n  Autonomous Driving\", \"summary\": \"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must navigate dynamic urban environments where\\nocclusions and perception limitations introduce significant uncertainties. This\\nresearch builds upon and extends existing approaches in risk-aware motion\\nplanning and occlusion tracking to address these challenges. While prior\\nstudies have developed individual methods for occlusion tracking and risk\\nassessment, a comprehensive method integrating these techniques has not been\\nfully explored. We, therefore, enhance a phantom agent-centric model by\\nincorporating sequential reasoning to track occluded areas and predict\\npotential hazards. Our model enables realistic scenario representation and\\ncontext-aware risk evaluation by modeling diverse phantom agents, each with\\ndistinct behavior profiles. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach\\nimproves situational awareness and balances proactive safety with efficient\\ntraffic flow. While these results underline the potential of our method,\\nvalidation in real-world scenarios is necessary to confirm its feasibility and\\ngeneralizability. By utilizing and advancing established methodologies, this\\nwork contributes to safer and more reliable AV planning in complex urban\\nenvironments. To support further research, our method is available as\\nopen-source software at:\\nhttps://github.com/TUM-AVS/OcclusionAwareMotionPlanning\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:48:50Z\"}"}
