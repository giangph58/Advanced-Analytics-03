{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02271v1\", \"title\": \"Efficient Computation of Hyper-triangles on Hypergraphs\", \"summary\": \"Hypergraphs, which use hyperedges to capture groupwise interactions among\\ndifferent entities, have gained increasing attention recently for their\\nversatility in effectively modeling real-world networks. In this paper, we\\nstudy the problem of computing hyper-triangles (formed by three fully-connected\\nhyperedges), which is a basic structural unit in hypergraphs. Although existing\\napproaches can be adopted to compute hyper-triangles by exhaustively examining\\nhyperedge combinations, they overlook the structural characteristics\\ndistinguishing different hyper-triangle patterns. Consequently, these\\napproaches lack specificity in computing particular hyper-triangle patterns and\\nexhibit low efficiency. In this paper, we unveil a new formation pathway for\\nhyper-triangles, transitioning from hyperedges to hyperwedges before assembling\\ninto hyper-triangles, and classify hyper-triangle patterns based on\\nhyperwedges. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a two-step framework to\\nreduce the redundant checking of hyperedge combinations. Under this framework,\\nwe propose efficient algorithms for computing a specific pattern of\\nhyper-triangles. Approximate algorithms are also devised to support estimated\\ncounting scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a fine-grained hypergraph\\nclustering coefficient measurement that can reflect diverse properties of\\nhypergraphs based on different hyper-triangle patterns. Extensive experimental\\nevaluations conducted on 11 real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and\\nefficiency of our proposed techniques.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:32:37Z\"}"}
