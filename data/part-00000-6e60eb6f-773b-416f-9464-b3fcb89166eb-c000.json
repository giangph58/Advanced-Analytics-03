Recently, it has been demonstrated that\\nthe recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth\\nhypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport\\ncoefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the\\nrecursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method\\nto spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we\\nfind a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by\\nthe dynamical quantum phase transition.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:43:09Z\"}"}
