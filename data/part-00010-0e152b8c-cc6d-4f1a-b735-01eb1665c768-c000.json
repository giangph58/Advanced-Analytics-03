It\\nis first shown that the multiplicity of any multiple root in any Adler--Moser\\npolynomial is a triangular number (i.e., its multiplicity is equal to\\n$n(n+1)/2$ for a certain integer $n$). Then, it is shown that corresponding to\\na nonzero multiple root of the Adler--Moser polynomial, a triangular rogue\\ncluster would appear on the spatial-temporal plane. This triangular rogue\\ncluster comprises $n(n+1)/2$ fundamental rogue waves forming a triangular\\nshape, and space-time locations of fundamental rogue waves in this triangle are\\na linear transformation of the Yablonskii--Vorob'ev polynomial $Q_{n}(z)$'s\\nroot structure. In the special case where this multiple root of the\\nAdler--Moser polynomial is zero, the associated rogue pattern is found to be a\\n$n$-th order rogue wave in the $O(1)$ neighborhood of the spatial-temporal\\norigin. These general results are demonstrated on two integrable systems: the\\nnonlinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger equation and the generalized derivative nonlinear\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger equation. For these equations, asymptotic predictions of rogue\\npatterns are compared with true rogue solutions and good agreement between them\\nis illustrated.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.SI\", \"categories\": \"nlin.SI,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:39:24Z\"}"}
