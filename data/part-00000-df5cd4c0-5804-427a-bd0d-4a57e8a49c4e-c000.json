The focus is on\\ncyber-physical systems with dynamics which are linear, stochastic, potentially\\nunstable, and partially observed. We employ System Level Synthesis (SLS) to\\nreformulate the problem as the search for an equilibrium profile of closed-loop\\nresponses to noise, which can then be used to reconstruct a stabilising\\noutput-feedback policy. Under this setup, we leverage monotone operator theory\\nto design a GFNE-seeking algorithm capable to enforce closed-loop stability,\\noperational constraints, and communication constraints onto the control\\npolicies. This algorithm is amenable to numerical implementation and we provide\\nconditions for its convergence. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated\\nexperiment on the noncooperative stabilisation of a decentralised power-grid.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:43:02Z\"}"}
