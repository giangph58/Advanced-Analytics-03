{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05900v1\", \"title\": \"Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics\", \"summary\": \"An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization\\nthat strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians\\nin the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model\\nLagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative\\npoint of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect\\nthis criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable.\\nThe aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict\\nrenormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity.\\nFirst, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert\\naction gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic\\ngravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most\\nconservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly\\npredictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in\\nthe sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to\\nthe CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological\\npredictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the\\n(super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:54:19Z\"}"}
