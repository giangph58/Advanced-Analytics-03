This nonlocal variant of the\\nharmonic map heat flow has been studied recently in connection with free\\nboundary minimal surfaces. We introduce a new class of initial data for the\\nflow, broader than the conventional energy or Sobolev spaces considered in\\nprevious work, for which we establish existence, uniqueness, and continuous\\ndependence.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:38:13Z\"}"}
