To realize the diverse applications of SWCNTs, it is essential to\\nenhance their crystallinity through effective defect healing. However,\\ntraditional thermal treatments typically require temperatures above\\n1800{\\\\deg}C, which can alter the nanotube structure. Previously, defect healing\\nof SWCNTs was achieved at a relatively low temperature of 1100{\\\\deg}C, using\\nC$_{2}$H$_{2}$ assistance, but the efficiency was limited. In this study, we\\ndeveloped a C$_{2}$H$_{2}$-assisted multiple-cycle process at an even lower\\ntemperature of 1000{\\\\deg}C combined with air exposure, achieving highly\\nefficient defect healing while preserving the nanotube structure. The\\ncombination of multiple-cycle treatment and air exposure between cycles was\\nfound to promote defect activation, suppress the formation of amorphous carbon,\\nand enhance the effectiveness of defect healing. Additionally, we successfully\\nhealed commercially available bulk-scale SWCNTs (super-growth SWCNTs), noting\\nthat their healing behavior differed from lab-grown SWCNTs with smaller\\ndiameters synthesized from nanodiamond. The efficient and structure-preserved\\nhealing process developed in this study broadens the potential applications of\\nhigh-quality SWCNTs, including flexible electronics, high-performance\\ncomposites, and energy storage devices.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:53:11Z\"}"}
