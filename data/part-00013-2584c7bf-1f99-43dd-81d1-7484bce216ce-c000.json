{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01891v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations\", \"summary\": \"Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a\\nfundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers\\nand physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of\\nfrequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their\\naccuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid\\nNetwork, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical\\nlayers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations,\\nnamely Kovasznay flow problem. This approach decomposes the solution into\\nseparate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid\\nNetworks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We\\nevaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the\\nMulti-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven\\nscenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network\\nachieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components\\nand 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using\\n24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of\\nhybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid\\ndynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:50:54Z\"}"}
