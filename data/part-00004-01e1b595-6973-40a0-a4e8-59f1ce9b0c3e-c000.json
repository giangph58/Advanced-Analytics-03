{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04929v1\", \"title\": \"The Linearized Vlasov-Maxwell System as a Hamiltonian System\", \"summary\": \"We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system\\nwith a Maxwellian background distribution function. We discuss the geometric\\nproperties of the model at the continuous level, and how to discretize the\\nmodel in the GEMPIC framework [1]. This method allows us to keep the structure\\nof the system at the semi-discrete level. To integrate the model in time, we\\nemploy a Poisson splitting and discuss how to integrate each subsystem\\nseparately. We test the model against the full Vlasov-Maxwell model with a\\ncontrol variate method for noise reduction; the two chosen test-cases are the\\nweak Landau damping and the Bernstein waves. Both test-cases exhibit the same\\nphysical properties for short simulations but our model enjoys better long-time\\nstability and energy conservation due to its geometric construction. The model\\nis implemented in the open-source Python library STRUPHY [2, 3].\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T11:13:36Z\"}"}
