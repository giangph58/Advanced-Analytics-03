These deformed\\noscillator potentials share the equally spaced energy levels of the shifted\\nharmonic oscillator but differ significantly in that they are non-harmonic.\\nConsequently, their ground states and thermal equilibrium states are no longer\\nGaussian and exhibit non-classical properties. We quantify their\\nnon-Gaussianity and evaluate their non-classicality using various measures,\\nincluding quadrature squeezing, photon number squeezing, Wigner function\\nnegativity, and quadrature coherence scale. Additionally, we employ quantum\\nestimation theory to identify optimal measurement strategies and establish\\nultimate precision bounds for inferring the deformation parameter. Our findings\\nprove that quantum systems isospectral to the harmonic oscillator may represent\\npromising platforms for quantum information with continuous variables. In turn,\\nnon-Gaussian and non-classical stationary states may be obtained and these\\nfeatures persist at non-zero temperature.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:00:01Z\"}"}
