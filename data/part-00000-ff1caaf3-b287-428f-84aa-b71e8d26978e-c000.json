When integrating road\\nheating into the power distribution system, we need to optimize the flow of\\nelectric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and\\nconventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we extend the power\\ndistribution system considered in the authors' previous study to the case where\\nbattery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive\\nswitching control that achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation\\nof voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify\\nthe effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical\\nsimulation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:57:04Z\"}"}
