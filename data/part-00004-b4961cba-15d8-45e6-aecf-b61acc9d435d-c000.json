{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835v1\", \"title\": \"Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch\", \"summary\": \"We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs)\\nstrong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a\\nscalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to\\nprovide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal\\ninvariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation\\ndominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As\\na result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric\\nfields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature\\nproblem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB\\nphase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated\\nwhen the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar\\nfield is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to\\nthe cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction\\nproblem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned\\nproblems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:18:30Z\"}"}
