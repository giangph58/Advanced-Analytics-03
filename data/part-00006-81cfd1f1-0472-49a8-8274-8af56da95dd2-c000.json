In the proof presented by Robertson and\\nSeymour the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ are non-constructive. Kawarabayashi,\\nThomas, and Wollan [arXiv, 2020] found a new proof showing that $f_1(t), f_2(t)\\n\\\\in 2^{\\\\mathbf{poly}(t)}$. While believing that this bound was the best their\\nmethods could achieve, Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan conjectured that $f_1$\\nand $f_2$ can be improved to be polynomials.\\n  In this paper we confirm their conjecture and prove that $f_1(t), f_2(t) \\\\in\\n\\\\mathbf{O}(t^{2300})$. Our proofs are fully constructive and yield a\\npolynomial-time algorithm that either finds $H$ as a minor in a graph $G$ or\\nproduces a clique-sum decomposition for $G$ as above.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,cs.DM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:35:45Z\"}"}
