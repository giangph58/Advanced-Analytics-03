{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23727v1\", \"title\": \"Angle-dependent in-situ fast flavor transformations in post-neutron star\\n  merger disks\", \"summary\": \"The remnant black hole-accretion disk system resulting from binary neutron\\nstar mergers has proven to be a promising site for synthesizing the heaviest\\nelements via rapid neutron capture (r-process). A critical factor in\\ndetermining the full r-process pattern in these environments is the neutron\\nrichness of the ejecta, which is strongly influenced by neutrino interactions.\\nOne key ingredient shaping these interactions is fast neutrino flavor\\nconversions (FFCs), which arise due to angular crossings in neutrino\\ndistributions and occur on nanosecond timescales. We present the first\\nthree-dimensional, in-situ, angle-dependent modeling of FFCs in post-merger\\ndisks, implemented within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with Monte\\nCarlo neutrino transport. Our results reveal that, by suppressing electron\\nneutrinos, FFCs more efficiently cool the disk and weaken the early thermally\\ndriven wind. Less re-leptonization due to electron neutrino absorption makes\\nthis cooler wind more neutron-rich, producing a more robust r-process at higher\\nlatitudes of the outflow. This study underscores the necessity of incorporating\\nFFCs in realistic simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:01:52Z\"}"}
