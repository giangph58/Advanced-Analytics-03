Tissue boundaries are associated with supracellular cables formed by\\nactin and the molecular motor non-muscle myosin II. Actomyosin cables generate\\ntension that prevents cell mixing. Whether other cellular behaviours contribute\\nto the formation of linear interfaces between cell populations remains unclear.\\nIn the Drosophila embryo, an actomyosin-based boundary separates the ectoderm\\nfrom the mesectoderm, a group of neuronal and glial progenitors. Mathematical\\nmodelling predicted that cell divisions in the ectoderm challenge the\\nmesectoderm-ectoderm (ME) boundary. Consistent with this, suppressing ectoderm\\ncell divisions in vivo prevented cell mixing across the ME boundary when\\nactomyosin-based tension was lost. Our mathematical model also predicted that\\ncell divisions sharpen the ME boundary by reducing tension and increasing cell\\nmotility in the ectoderm. We found that inhibiting ectoderm divisions in vivo\\nreduced boundary linearity. Using laser ablation and cell tracking, we\\ndemonstrated that cell divisions reduced junctional tension and increased cell\\nmovement in the ectoderm. Together, our results reveal that cell divisions\\nfacilitate cellular rearrangements to increase fluidity in a novel mechanism\\nfor boundary refinement.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:07:57Z\"}"}
