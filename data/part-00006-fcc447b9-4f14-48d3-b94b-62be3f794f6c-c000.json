We propose an approximate\\nPoisson-Boltzmann theory for analysis of the structure of the stratified brush\\nand compare it with results of numerical self-consistent field modelling. Both\\nanalytical and numerical models point to formation of a narrow cloud of\\ncounterions (internal double electrical layer) localized inside stratified\\nbrush at the boundary between the layers.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:25:10Z\"}"}
