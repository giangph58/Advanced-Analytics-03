{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05176v1\", \"title\": \"Cellular Network Design for UAV Corridors via Data-driven\\n  High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization\", \"summary\": \"We address the challenge of designing cellular networks for uncrewed aerial\\nvehicles (UAVs) corridors through a novel data-driven approach. We assess\\nmultiple state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO)\\ntechniques to jointly optimize the cell antenna tilts and half-power beamwidth\\n(HPBW). We find that some of these approaches achieve over 20dB gains in median\\nSINR along UAV corridors, with negligible degradation to ground user\\nperformance. Furthermore, we explore the HD-BO's capabilities in terms of model\\ngeneralization via transfer learning, where data from a previously observed\\nscenario source is leveraged to predict the optimal solution for a new scenario\\ntarget. We provide examples of scenarios where such transfer learning is\\nsuccessful and others where it fails. Moreover, we demonstrate that HD-BO\\nenables multi-objective optimization, identifying optimal design trade-offs\\nbetween data rates on the ground versus UAV coverage reliability. We observe\\nthat aiming to provide UAV coverage across the entire sky can lower the rates\\nfor ground users compared to setups specifically optimized for UAV corridors.\\nFinally, we validate our approach through a case study in a real-world cellular\\nnetwork, where HD-BO identifies optimal and non-obvious antenna configurations\\nthat result in more than double the rates along 3D UAV corridors with\\nnegligible ground performance loss.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:20:14Z\"}"}
