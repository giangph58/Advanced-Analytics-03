We describe the set of all\\nminimal solutions for a single equation. It is shown that any tropical linear\\ndifferential equation in a single unknown has either a solution or a solution\\nat infinity. For a generic system of $n$ tropical linear differential equations\\nin $n$ unknowns, upper and lower bounds on the number of minimal solutions are\\nestablished. The upper bound involves inversions of a family of permutations\\nwhich generalize inversions of a single permutation. For $n=1, 2$, we show that\\nthe bounds are sharp.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:00:24Z\"}"}
