{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01862v1\", \"title\": \"Axiomatic Foundations of Fractal Analysis and Fractal Number Theory\", \"summary\": \"We develop an axiomatic framework for fractal analysis and fractal number\\ntheory grounded in hierarchies of definability. Central to this approach is a\\nsequence of formal systems F_n, each corresponding to a definability level S_n\\ncontained in R of constructively accessible mathematical objects. This\\nstructure refines classical analysis by replacing uncountable global constructs\\nwith countable, syntactically constrained approximations.\\n  The axioms formalize: - A hierarchy of definability levels S_n, indexed by\\nsyntactic and ordinal complexity; - Fractal topologies and the induced notions\\nof continuity, compactness, and differentiability; - Layered integration and\\ndifferentiation with explicit convergence and definability bounds; - Arithmetic\\nand function spaces over the stratified continuum R_{S_n}, which is a subset of\\nR.\\n  This framework synthesizes constructive mathematics, proof-theoretic\\nstratification, and fractal geometric intuition into a unified, finitistically\\nstructured model. Key results include the definability-based classification of\\nreal numbers (e.g., algebraic, computable, Liouville), a stratified fundamental\\ntheorem of calculus with syntactic error bounds, and compatibility with base\\nsystems such as RCA_0 and ACA_0.\\n  The framework enables constructive approximation and syntactic regularization\\nof classical analysis, with applications to proof assistants, computable\\nmathematics, and foundational studies of the continuum.\", \"main_category\": \"math.LO\", \"categories\": \"math.LO,math.FA,F.4.1\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:14:50Z\"}"}
