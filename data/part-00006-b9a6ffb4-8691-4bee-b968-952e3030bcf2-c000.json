{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05092v1\", \"title\": \"Distortions in Periodicity Analysis of Blazars: The Impact of Flares\", \"summary\": \"Blazars, a unique class of active galactic nuclei, exhibit highly variable\\nemission across the electromagnetic spectrum. This variability frequently\\nmanifests as intense flaring events, sparking an ongoing debate in recent\\nliterature about whether these flares exhibit periodic behavior in certain\\nsources. However, many blazars also show clear signs of stochastic,\\nuncorrelated flares that do not follow a regular pattern. This paper explores\\nhow the presence of one such of these stochastic flares can distort an\\nintrinsically periodic pattern of emission in blazars. Our results demonstrate\\nthat, depending on the specific circumstances, the deviations in significance\\nand periods can exceed 100\\\\%. Sometimes, these deviations can be so severe that\\nthey eliminate any evidence of a periodic pattern. These findings highlight the\\ndramatic impact that flares can have on periodicity searches. To confront this\\nchallenge, we propose an innovative approach, the Singular Spectrum Analysis\\nmethod, which appears more robust against the effects of flares. As an\\nalternative solution, we also propose the sigma clipping technique to mitigate\\nthe impact of flares. This framework offers a valuable foundation for analyzing\\nperiodicity in similar astrophysical sources that are also subject to\\nstochastic flaring events.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:00:34Z\"}"}
