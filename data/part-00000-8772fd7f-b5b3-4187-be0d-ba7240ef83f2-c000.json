{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23747v1\", \"title\": \"Consistency-aware Self-Training for Iterative-based Stereo Matching\", \"summary\": \"Iterative-based methods have become mainstream in stereo matching due to\\ntheir high performance. However, these methods heavily rely on labeled data and\\nface challenges with unlabeled real-world data. To this end, we propose a\\nconsistency-aware self-training framework for iterative-based stereo matching\\nfor the first time, leveraging real-world unlabeled data in a teacher-student\\nmanner. We first observe that regions with larger errors tend to exhibit more\\npronounced oscillation characteristics during model prediction.Based on this,\\nwe introduce a novel consistency-aware soft filtering module to evaluate the\\nreliability of teacher-predicted pseudo-labels, which consists of a\\nmulti-resolution prediction consistency filter and an iterative prediction\\nconsistency filter to assess the prediction fluctuations of multiple\\nresolutions and iterative optimization respectively. Further, we introduce a\\nconsistency-aware soft-weighted loss to adjust the weight of pseudo-labels\\naccordingly, relieving the error accumulation and performance degradation\\nproblem due to incorrect pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\\nour method can improve the performance of various iterative-based stereo\\nmatching approaches in various scenarios. In particular, our method can achieve\\nfurther enhancements over the current SOTA methods on several benchmark\\ndatasets.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:58:25Z\"}"}
