We prove that when the topological\\ngroupoid with involution arises from a Deligne-Mumford stack over $\\\\mathbb{R}$,\\nthis fixed locus coincides with the real locus of the stack. This provides a\\ntopological framework to study real algebraic stacks, and in particular real\\nmoduli spaces. Finally, we propose a Smith-Thom type conjecture in this\\nsetting, generalizing the Smith-Thom inequality for topological spaces endowed\\nwith an involution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.AT,math.GN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:54:46Z\"}"}
