{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07597v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Long Short-Term Intention within Human Daily Behaviors\", \"summary\": \"In the domain of autonomous household robots, it is of utmost importance for\\nrobots to understand human behaviors and provide appropriate services. This\\nrequires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human\\nbehaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are\\nperceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots\\nshould strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if\\nhumans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed \\\"long\\nshort-term intention prediction\\\". This task requires robots can predict the\\nlong-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short\\nterm intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention.\\nMeanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the\\nshort-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and\\nsuggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention\\nmodel to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train\\nthis intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the\\nintention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based\\nlong-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing\\nthe consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental\\nresults indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist\\nrobots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and\\nshort-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term\\nand short-term intentions of humans.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:50:18Z\"}"}
