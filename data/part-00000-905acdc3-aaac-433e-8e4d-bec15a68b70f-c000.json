But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes\\ndomains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial\\nrisk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance\\ndomain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences\\nwhen users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized\\nguidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor\\npersonality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study\\nwith 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor\\nperformance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve\\nconflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to\\npositively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our\\nresults show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the\\nLLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward\\nunsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of\\nadvice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed,\\nusers reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional\\ntrust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents\\nprovided worse advice.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.HC,cs.IR,q-fin.CP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:41:03Z\"}"}
