{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06974v1\", \"title\": \"Framelets and Wavelets with Mixed Dilation Factors\", \"summary\": \"As a main research area in applied and computational harmonic analysis, the\\ntheory and applications of framelets have been extensively investigated. Most\\nexisting literature is devoted to framelet systems that only use one dilation\\nmatrix as the sampling factor. To keep some key properties such as\\ndirectionality, a framelet system often has a high redundancy rate. To reduce\\nredundancy, a one-dimensional tight framelet with mixed dilation factors has\\nbeen introduced for image processing. Though such tight framelets offer good\\nperformance in practice, their theoretical properties are far from being well\\nunderstood. In this paper, we will systematically investigate framelets with\\nmixed dilation factors, with arbitrary multiplicity in arbitrary dimensions. We\\nwill first study the discrete framelet transform employing a filter bank with\\nmixed dilation factors and discuss its various properties. Next, we will\\nintroduce the notion of a discrete affine system in $l_2(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ and\\nstudy discrete framelet transforms with mixed dilation factors. Finally, we\\nwill discuss framelets and wavelets with mixed dilation factors in the space\\n$L_2(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.FA\", \"categories\": \"math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:29:10Z\"}"}
