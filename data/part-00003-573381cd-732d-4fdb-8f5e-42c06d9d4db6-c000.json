{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02660v1\", \"title\": \"Complex Langevin Simulations of Supersymmetric Theories\", \"summary\": \"This review explores the Complex Langevin Method (CLM), a stochastic\\nquantization technique designed to address the sign problem in quantum field\\ntheories with complex actions. Beginning with foundational principles, the\\nreview examines the applications of CLM across a range of models, including\\nzero- and two-dimensional systems, supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and the\\nIKKT matrix model, a candidate for non-perturbative string theory. Key\\nadvancements, such as stabilization techniques and mass deformations, are\\nhighlighted as solutions to challenges like numerical instability and singular\\ndrift terms. The review emphasizes the capacity of CLM to simulate complex\\nsystems and reveal non-perturbative phenomena, positioning it as a powerful\\ntool for exploring quantum field theory and string theory. Future directions,\\nincluding higher-dimensional applications and benchmarking against quantum\\nsimulations, underscore the potential of CLM to advance both theoretical\\nunderstanding and computational methodologies.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:56:53Z\"}"}
