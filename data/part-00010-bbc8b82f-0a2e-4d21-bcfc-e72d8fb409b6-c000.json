However, its adoption remains limited among scientists outside\\nthe deep learning community due to storage, compute, and technical expertise\\nbarriers. To address this, we introduce Climplicit, a spatio-temporal\\ngeolocation encoder pretrained to generate implicit climatic representations\\nanywhere on Earth. By bypassing the need to download raw climatic rasters and\\ntrain feature extractors, our model uses x1000 fewer disk space and\\nsignificantly reduces computational needs for downstream tasks. We evaluate our\\nClimplicit embeddings on biomes classification, species distribution modeling,\\nand plant trait regression. We find that linear probing our Climplicit\\nembeddings consistently performs better or on par with training a model from\\nscratch on downstream tasks and overall better than alternative geolocation\\nencoding models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:58:55Z\"}"}
