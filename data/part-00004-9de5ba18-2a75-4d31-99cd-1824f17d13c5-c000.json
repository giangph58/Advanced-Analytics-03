{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05871v1\", \"title\": \"Agent Guide: A Simple Agent Behavioral Watermarking Framework\", \"summary\": \"The increasing deployment of intelligent agents in digital ecosystems, such\\nas social media platforms, has raised significant concerns about traceability\\nand accountability, particularly in cybersecurity and digital content\\nprotection. Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques,\\nwhich rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the\\nchallenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during\\nbehavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent\\nGuide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by\\nguiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases,\\nwhile preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach\\ndecouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark)\\nand action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided\\nbiases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based\\nstatistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over\\nmultiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent\\nprofiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection\\nwith a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust\\nsolution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious\\nagents and protecting proprietary agent systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,K.6.5\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:54:49Z\"}"}
