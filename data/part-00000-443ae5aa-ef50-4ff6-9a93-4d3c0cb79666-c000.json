{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24121v1\", \"title\": \"IMPACT: A Generic Semantic Loss for Multimodal Medical Image\\n  Registration\", \"summary\": \"Image registration is fundamental in medical imaging, enabling precise\\nalignment of anatomical structures for diagnosis, treatment planning,\\nimage-guided treatment or longitudinal monitoring. This work introduces IMPACT\\n(Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality\\nregistration), a generic semantic similarity metric designed for seamless\\nintegration into diverse image registration frameworks (such as Elastix and\\nVoxelmorph). It compares deep learning-based features extracted from medical\\nimages without requiring task-specific training, ensuring broad applicability\\nacross various modalities. By leveraging the features of the large-scale\\npretrained TotalSegmentator models and the ability to integrate Segment\\nAnything Model (SAM) and other large-scale segmentation networks, this approach\\noffers significant advantages. It provides robust, scalable, and efficient\\nsolutions for multimodal image registration. The IMPACT loss was evaluated on\\nfive challenging registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT, and pelvic\\nMR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, such as Target Registration Error and\\nDice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated significant improvements in\\nanatomical alignment compared to baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further\\nconfirmed the increased robustness of the proposed metric in the face of noise,\\nartifacts, and modality variations. IMPACT's versatility and efficiency make it\\na valuable tool for advancing registration performance in clinical and research\\napplications, addressing critical challenges in multimodal medical imaging.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:08:21Z\"}"}
