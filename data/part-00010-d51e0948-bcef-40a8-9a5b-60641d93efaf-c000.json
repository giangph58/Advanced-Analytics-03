{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06961v1\", \"title\": \"Two by Two: Learning Multi-Task Pairwise Objects Assembly for\\n  Generalizable Robot Manipulation\", \"summary\": \"3D assembly tasks, such as furniture assembly and component fitting, play a\\ncrucial role in daily life and represent essential capabilities for future home\\nrobots. Existing benchmarks and datasets predominantly focus on assembling\\ngeometric fragments or factory parts, which fall short in addressing the\\ncomplexities of everyday object interactions and assemblies. To bridge this\\ngap, we present 2BY2, a large-scale annotated dataset for daily pairwise\\nobjects assembly, covering 18 fine-grained tasks that reflect real-life\\nscenarios, such as plugging into sockets, arranging flowers in vases, and\\ninserting bread into toasters. 2BY2 dataset includes 1,034 instances and 517\\npairwise objects with pose and symmetry annotations, requiring approaches that\\nalign geometric shapes while accounting for functional and spatial\\nrelationships between objects. Leveraging the 2BY2 dataset, we propose a\\ntwo-step SE(3) pose estimation method with equivariant features for assembly\\nconstraints. Compared to previous shape assembly methods, our approach achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance across all 18 tasks in the 2BY2 dataset.\\nAdditionally, robot experiments further validate the reliability and\\ngeneralization ability of our method for complex 3D assembly tasks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:12:38Z\"}"}
