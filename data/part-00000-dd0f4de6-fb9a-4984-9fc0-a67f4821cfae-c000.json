A fruitful\\napproach is to study contact structures using line bundle-valued $1$-forms.\\nSpecifically, we introduce the notions of $0$ and $+1$-shifted contact\\nstructures on Lie groupoids. To define the kernel of a line bundle-valued\\n$1$-form $\\\\theta$ on a Lie groupoid, we draw inspiration from the concept of\\nthe homotopy kernel in Homological Algebra. That kernel is essentially given by\\na representation up to homotopy (RUTH). Similarly, the curvature is described\\nby a specific RUTH morphism. Both the definitions are motivated by the\\nSymplectic-to-Contact Dictionary, which establishes a relationship between\\nSymplectic and Contact Geometry. Examples of $0$-shifted contact structures can\\nbe found in contact structures on orbifolds, while examples of $+1$-shifted\\ncontact structures include the prequantization of $+1$-shifted symplectic\\nstructures and the integration of Dirac-Jacobi structures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math-ph,math.MP,math.SG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:52:35Z\"}"}
