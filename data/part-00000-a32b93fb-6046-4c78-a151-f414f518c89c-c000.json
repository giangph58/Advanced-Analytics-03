{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24099v1\", \"title\": \"Level the Level: Balancing Game Levels for Asymmetric Player Archetypes\\n  With Reinforcement Learning\", \"summary\": \"Balancing games, especially those with asymmetric multiplayer content,\\nrequires significant manual effort and extensive human playtesting during\\ndevelopment. For this reason, this work focuses on generating balanced levels\\ntailored to asymmetric player archetypes, where the disparity in abilities is\\nbalanced entirely through the level design. For instance, while one archetype\\nmay have an advantage over another, both should have an equal chance of\\nwinning. We therefore conceptualize game balancing as a procedural content\\ngeneration problem and build on and extend a recently introduced method that\\nuses reinforcement learning to balance tile-based game levels. We evaluate the\\nmethod on four different player archetypes and demonstrate its ability to\\nbalance a larger proportion of levels compared to two baseline approaches.\\nFurthermore, our results indicate that as the disparity between player\\narchetypes increases, the required number of training steps grows, while the\\nmodel's accuracy in achieving balance decreases.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:55:04Z\"}"}
