{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06817v1\", \"title\": \"Unparalleled instances of prolifickness, random walks, and square root\\n  boundaries\", \"summary\": \"We revisit the problem of influencing the sex ratio of a population by\\nsubjecting reproduction of each family to some stopping rule. As an easy\\nconsequence of the strong law of large numbers, no such modification is\\npossible in the sense that the ratio converges to 1 almost surely, for any\\nstopping rule that is finite almost surely. We proceed to quantify the effects\\nand provide limit distributions for the properly rescaled sex ratio. Besides\\nthe total ratio, which is predominantly considered in the pertinent literature,\\nwe also analyze the average sex ratio, which may converge to values different\\nfrom 1. The first part of this note is largely expository, applying classical\\nresults and standard methods from the fluctuation theory of random walks. In\\nthe second part we apply tail asymptotics for the time at which a random walk\\nhits a one-sided square root boundary, exhibit the differences to the\\ncorresponding two-sided problem, and use a limit law related to the empirical\\ndispersion coefficient of a heavy-tailed distribution. Finally, we derive a\\nlarge deviations result for a special stopping strategy, using saddle point\\nasymptotics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:19:37Z\"}"}
