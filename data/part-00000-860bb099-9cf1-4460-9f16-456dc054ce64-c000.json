{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795v1\", \"title\": \"Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels\", \"summary\": \"Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and\\ncontinuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory\\nplanning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input.\\nUnder noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary\\nsignificantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome\\nthis issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm\\nwith a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference\\ntrajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target\\nreference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning\\nalgorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus\\nimplicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is\\nassessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype\\nvehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy\\nand substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of\\nnoisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a\\ncertainty equivalent formulation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:15:55Z\"}"}
