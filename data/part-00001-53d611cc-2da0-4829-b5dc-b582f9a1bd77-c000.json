The wavefunctions\\nof hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified\\nJackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been\\nextended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as\\ngain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra\\ncan be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane,\\nwhether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines,\\nrespectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be\\ncontinuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the\\nanalytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero\\nenergy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct\\nphases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian\\nregime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and\\nthe decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation\\nquantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems\\nin terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected\\nby the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings\\nshed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in\\nnonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:59:46Z\"}"}
