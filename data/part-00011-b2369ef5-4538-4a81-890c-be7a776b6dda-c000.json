{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02713v1\", \"title\": \"Web3DB: Web 3.0 RDBMS for Individual Data Ownership\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces Web3DB, a decentralized relational database management\\nsystem (RDBMS) designed to align with the principles of Web 3.0, addressing\\ncritical shortcomings of traditional centralized DBMS, such as data privacy,\\nsecurity vulnerabilities, and single points of failure. Several similar systems\\nhave been proposed, but they are not compatible with the legacy systems based\\non RDBMS. Motivated by the necessity for enhanced data sovereignty and the\\ndecentralization of data control, Web3DB leverages blockchain technology for\\nfine-grained access control and utilizes decentralized data storage. This\\nsystem leverages a novel, modular architecture that contributes to enhanced\\nflexibility, scalability, and user-centric functionality. Central to the Web3DB\\ninnovation is its decentralized query execution, which uses cryptographic\\nsortition and blockchain verification to ensure secure and fair query\\nprocessing across network nodes. The motivation for integrating relational\\ndatabases within decentralized DBMS primarily stems from the need to combine\\nthe robustness and ease of use of relational database structures with the\\nbenefits of decentralization. This paper outlines the architecture of Web3DB,\\nits practical implementation, and the system's ability to support SQL-like\\noperations on relational data, manage multi-tenancy, and facilitate open data\\nsharing, setting new standards for decentralized databases in the Web 3.0 era.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DB\", \"categories\": \"cs.DB,cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:52:39Z\"}"}
