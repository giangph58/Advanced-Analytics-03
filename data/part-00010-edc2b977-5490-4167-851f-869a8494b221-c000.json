The\\nvan der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ has attracted extensive interest due to\\nits ultra-narrow exciton feature which is closely linked with the magnetic\\nordering. Here, we use time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to investigate\\nphoto-excited carriers in NiPS$_3$. We identify the onset of interband\\ntransitions and estimate the exciton dissociation energy from the excitation\\nwavelength and fluence dependence of the transient spectral weight. Our results\\nprovide key insights to quantify the exciton characteristics and validate the\\nband structure for NiPS$_3$.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:55:55Z\"}"}
