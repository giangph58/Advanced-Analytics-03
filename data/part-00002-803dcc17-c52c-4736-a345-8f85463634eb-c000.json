Building on\\nprevious works, we establish space-time regularity under a non-degeneracy\\ncondition that does not require an assumption on the derivative of the symbol\\nof the corresponding kinetic equation, a restriction imposed in earlier\\nstudies. This allows us to obtain regularity results for certain equations not\\naccounted for by prior theory, albeit with reduced regularity exponents. Our\\napproach uses a kinetic formulation with two transport equations, one of second\\norder and one of first order, leveraging a form of \\\"parabolic regularity\\\"\\ninherent in these equations that was not utilized in previous studies.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:00:58Z\"}"}
