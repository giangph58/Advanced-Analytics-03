This has key implications for molecular,\\nnanoscale, and quantum technologies, for which delocalization (and decoherence)\\nrates are essential figures of merit. Here, we apply the core hole clock\\ntechnique - an energy-domain variant of ultrafast spectroscopy - to probe the\\ndelocalization of a photoexcited electron inside a closed molecular cage,\\nnamely the Ar 2p54s1 state of Ar@C60. Despite marginal frontier orbital mixing\\nin the ground configuration, almost 80% of the excited state density is found\\noutside the buckyball due to the formation of a markedly diffuse hybrid\\norbital. Far from isolating the intracage excitation, the surrounding fullerene\\nis instead a remarkably efficient conduit for electron transfer: we measure\\ncharacteristic delocalization times of 6.6 $\\\\pm$ 0.3 fs and $\\\\lesssim$ 500\\nattoseconds, respectively, for a 3D Ar@C60 film and a 2D monolayer on Ag(111).\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:45:23Z\"}"}
