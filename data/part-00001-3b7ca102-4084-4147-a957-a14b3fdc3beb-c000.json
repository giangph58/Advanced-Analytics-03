{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24352v1\", \"title\": \"CMS Token Transition\", \"summary\": \"Within the LHC community, a momentous transition has been occurring in\\nauthorization. For nearly 20 years, services within the Worldwide LHC Computing\\nGrid (WLCG) have authorized based on mapping an identity, derived from an X.509\\ncredential, or a group/role, derived from a VOMS extension issued by the\\nexperiment. A fundamental shift is occurring to capabilities: the credential, a\\nbearer token, asserts the authorizations of the bearer, not the identity. By\\nthe HL-LHC era, the CMS experiment plans for the transition to tokens, based on\\nthe WLCG Common JSON Web Token profile, to be complete. Services in the\\ntechnology architecture include the INDIGO Identity and Access Management\\nserver to issue tokens; a HashiCorp Vault server to store and refresh access\\ntokens for users and jobs; a managed token bastion server to push credentials\\nto the HTCondor CredMon service; and HTCondor to maintain valid tokens in\\nlong-running batch jobs. We will describe the transition plans of the\\nexperiment, current status, configuration of the central authorization server,\\nlessons learned in commissioning token-based access with sites, and operational\\nexperience using tokens for both job submissions and file transfers.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:34:56Z\"}"}
