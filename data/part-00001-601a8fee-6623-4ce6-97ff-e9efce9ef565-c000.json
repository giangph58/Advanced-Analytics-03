For this reason, most\\nwidely adopted packages for estimating correlations use clustering algorithms\\nto approximate local trends. However, methods for quantifying the error\\nintroduced by this clustering have been understudied. In response, we present\\nan algorithm for estimating correlations that is probabilistic in the way that\\nit clusters objects, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty caused by\\nclustering simply through model inference. These soft clustering assignments\\nenable correlation estimators that are theoretically differentiable with\\nrespect to their input catalogs. Thus, we also build a theoretical framework\\nfor differentiable correlation functions and describe their utility in\\ncomparison to existing surrogate models. Notably, we find that repeated\\nnormalization and distance function calls slow gradient calculations and that\\nsparse Jacobians destabilize precision, pointing towards either approximate or\\nsurrogate methods as a necessary solution to exact gradients from correlation\\nfunctions. To that end, we close with a discussion of surrogate models as\\nproxies for correlation functions. We provide an example that demonstrates the\\nefficacy of surrogate models to enable gradient-based optimization of\\nastrophysical model parameters, successfully minimizing a correlation function\\noutput. Our numerical experiments cover science cases across cosmology, from\\npoint spread function (PSF) modeling efforts to gravitational simulations to\\ngalaxy intrinsic alignment (IA).\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:18:39Z\"}"}
