By modeling spatially correlated\\nmanufacturing variations as a stationary Gaussian process and applying linear\\nfunctional theory, our approach enables rapid prediction of phase difference\\ndistributions through numerical integration. We validate the method using\\ntolerance optimization and virtual manufacturing experiments, demonstrating its\\naccuracy and significant reduction in computational burden. This framework\\noffers a practical and scalable alternative for error analysis and robust\\ndesign in photonic systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:54:45Z\"}"}
