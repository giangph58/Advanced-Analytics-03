To obtain these\\nproperties, we need to identify these MS binaries. In this paper, we have\\ndeveloped a method to differentiate single MS stars from double MS binaries\\nfrom the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) Survey with machine learning.\\nThis method is reliable and efficient to identify binaries with mass ratios\\nbetween 0.20 and 0.80, which is independent of the mass ratio distribution. But\\nthe number of binaries identified with this method is not a good approximation\\nto the number of binaries in the original sample due to the low detection\\nefficiency of binaries with mass ratios smaller than 0.20 or larger than 0.80.\\nTherefore, we have improved this point by using the detection efficiencies of\\nour method and an empirical mass ratio distribution and then can infer the\\nbinary fraction in the sample. Once the CSST data are available, we can\\nidentify MS binaries with our trained multi-layer perceptron model and derive\\nthe binary fraction of the sample.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T02:57:41Z\"}"}
