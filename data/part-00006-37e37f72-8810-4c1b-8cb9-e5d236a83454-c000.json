{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02560v1\", \"title\": \"L-LBVC: Long-Term Motion Estimation and Prediction for Learned\\n  Bi-Directional Video Compression\", \"summary\": \"Recently, learned video compression (LVC) has shown superior performance\\nunder low-delay configuration. However, the performance of learned\\nbi-directional video compression (LBVC) still lags behind traditional\\nbi-directional coding. The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate\\nlong-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in\\nlarge motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes\\na novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion\\nestimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions.\\nSpecifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and\\nnon-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large\\nmotions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to\\nestimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction\\nmodule that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the\\naccuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference\\nframes during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training.\\nExperiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous\\nstate-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets\\nunder random access configuration.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.MM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:15:45Z\"}"}
