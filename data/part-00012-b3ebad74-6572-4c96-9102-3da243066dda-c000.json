However, significant challenges arise when extracting\\ninfinite-volume scattering parameters from finite-volume energy levels using\\nthe conventional L\\\\\\\"uscher method, particularly due to the presence of\\nleft-hand cuts induced by long-range interactions such as the one-pion\\nexchange. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that\\ncombines chiral effective field theory and the plane-wave expansion with the\\nHamiltonian approach. By solving a Schr\\\\\\\"odinger-like equation in a finite\\nvolume, this method establishes a connection between finite-volume energy\\nspectra and infinite-volume physical quantities, while effectively handling\\nissues caused by left-hand cuts. Furthermore, the adoption of a plane-wave\\nbasis helps mitigating complexities associated with partial-wave mixing. Our\\npreliminary numerical results at $m_\\\\pi \\\\approx 280$ MeV confirm that this\\napproach efficiently overcomes the shortcomings of the L\\\\\\\"uscher method and\\nindicate a resonant interpretation of the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state--in contrast to\\nthe virtual state suggested in conventional analyses.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:34:10Z\"}"}
