It is particularly important for estimating the\\nintegration error for certain classes of functions on the sphere. Building on a\\nrecently proven explicit formula for the spherical discrepancy, we show as a\\nmain result of this paper that this discrepancy is Lipschitz continuous in a\\nneighbourhood of so-called generic point sets (as they are typical outcomes of\\nMonte-Carlo sampling). This property may have some impact (both algorithmically\\nand theoretically for deriving necessary optimality conditions) on optimal\\nquantization, i.e., on finding point sets of fixed size on the sphere having\\nminimum spherical discrepancy.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:25:30Z\"}"}
