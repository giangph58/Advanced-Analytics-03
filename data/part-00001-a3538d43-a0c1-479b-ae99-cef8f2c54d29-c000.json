In\\ncomposite Higgs scenarios, the Higgs may manifest as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone\\nboson (pNGB) arising from a strongly interacting sector. The $SU(5)/SO(5)$\\nComposite Higgs Model features a rich scalar sector, with the decay patterns of\\nthe scalars being heavily influenced by how fermions are embedded in various\\nrepresentations of $SU(5)$. We discuss how the mass of the pNGB scalars and\\ntheir couplings depend functionally on the compositeness scale and parameters\\nof the strong sector. Unique decay modes of the scalars emerge from the model\\nwhen the mixing between the mass and the gauge eigenstates is non-negligible.\\nWe present a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the fermiophilic and\\nfermiophobic decay modes of the pNGB scalars. One of our main findings is that\\nthe decay patterns of the two singly charged scalars differ significantly.\\nAdditionally, one pNGB scalar decays to another on-shell pNGB scalar when the\\nmasses are more than $\\\\sim 1$ TeV. Both these factors play a significant role\\nin creating highly distinctive signatures in collider experiments. A muon\\ncollider presents a promising avenue for detecting pNGB scalars with masses\\ngreater than 1 TeV, particularly, in final states involving multiple jets.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:39:32Z\"}"}
