{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05996v1\", \"title\": \"Unified Beta Regression Model with Random Effects for the Analysis of\\n  Sensory Attributes\", \"summary\": \"Studies involving sensory analysis are essential for evaluating and measuring\\nthe characteristics of food and beverages, including consumer acceptance of\\nsamples. For various products, the experimental designs are generally\\nincomplete block designs, with sensory attributes assessed using hedonic\\nscales, ratings, or scores. Statistical methods such as generalized logits are\\ncommonly used to analyze these data but face limitations, including convergence\\nissues due to superparameterization. Furthermore, sensory attributes are\\ntraditionally analyzed separately, increasing the complexity of the process and\\ncomplicating the interpretation of results. This study proposes a unified beta\\nregression model with random effects for simultaneously analyzing multiple\\nsensory attributes, whose scores were converted to the (0,1) interval.\\nSimulation studies demonstrated overall agreement rates greater than 82% for\\nthe unified model compared to models fitted separately for each attribute. As a\\nmotivational example, the unified model was applied to a real dataset in which\\n98 potential consumers evaluated eight grape juice formulations for each\\nsensory attribute: colour, flavour, aroma, acidity, and sweetness. The unified\\nmodel identified the same top-rated formulations as the separately fitted\\nmodels, characterized by a higher proportion of juice relative to sugar. The\\nresults underscore the ability of the unified model to simplify the analytical\\nprocess without compromising accuracy, offering an efficient and insightful\\napproach to sensory studies.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:01:58Z\"}"}
