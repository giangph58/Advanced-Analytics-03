In\\n1958, Gallai proved that a finite system of precedence constraints admits\\nsolutions if and only if the corresponding precedence graph does not contain\\npositive-weight circuits. We show that this result extends naturally to the\\ncase of infinitely many constraints. We then analyze two specific classes of\\ninfinite precedence graphs -- $\\\\mathbb{N}$-periodic and ultimately periodic\\ngraphs -- and prove that the existence of solutions of their related\\nconstraints can be verified in strongly polynomial time. The obtained\\nalgorithms find applications in P-time event graphs, which are a subclass of\\nP-time Petri nets able to model production systems under cyclic schedules where\\ntasks need to be performed within given time windows.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.DM,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:26:23Z\"}"}
