{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02557v1\", \"title\": \"Aging of ring polymeric topological glass formers via thermal quench\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the dynamical response of glass-forming systems composed of\\ntopologically constrained ring polymers subjected to an instantaneous thermal\\nquench, employing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate\\nthat the onset of glassiness depends on polymer stiffness, with increased\\nrigidity enhancing configurational constraints and delaying structural\\nrelaxation. In the glassy regime, the system exhibits hallmark aging\\ncharacteristics, as evidenced by two-time correlation functions, namely the\\nmean square displacement and self-intermediate scattering function, which\\ndisplay a clear dependence on the waiting time following the thermal quench.\\nThe extracted relaxation timescale ($\\\\tau_\\\\alpha$) follows an approximate\\nsimple aging scenario with waiting time ($t_w$), described by $\\\\tau_\\\\alpha \\\\sim\\nt_w^b$, where $0.8 < b < 0.93$. Finally, we analyze the threading of rings\\nduring the thermal quench, demonstrating that both increased and persistent\\nthreading correlate with the emergence of glassiness. Moreover, the threading\\npersistence timescale exhibits a strong correlation with the structural\\nrelaxation timescale. Our study thus provides a comprehensive view of\\nstructural relaxation and aging in dense ring polymer systems, highlighting the\\ncritical roles of topological constraints and polymer stiffness in governing\\nnon-equilibrium glassy dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T13:13:18Z\"}"}
