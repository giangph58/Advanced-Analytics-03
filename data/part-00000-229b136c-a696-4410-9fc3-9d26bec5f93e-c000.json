In this paper, we establish various\\nversions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks\\nassociated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\\\\mathbb V^{\\\\otimes N}$\\n(where $N\\\\in\\\\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the\\nIntroduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:\\n  Let $\\\\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$\\noutgoing marked points, and let $\\\\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann\\nsurface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\\\\mathbb\\nW\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Mod}(\\\\mathbb V^{\\\\otimes N})$ and $\\\\mathbb X\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Mod}(\\\\mathbb\\nV^{\\\\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\\\\mathfrak F$ and $\\\\mathfrak\\nG$ respectively. For each $\\\\mathbb{M} \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Mod}(\\\\mathbb{V}^{\\\\otimes\\nR})$, assign $\\\\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\\\\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing\\nmarked points of $\\\\mathfrak F$ and $\\\\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the\\ncorresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\\\\mathscr T_{\\\\mathfrak F}^*(\\\\mathbb\\nM\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb W)$ and $\\\\mathscr T_{\\\\mathfrak{G}}^*(\\\\mathbb M'\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb\\nX)$. Let the $\\\\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing\\n$\\\\mathfrak F$, $\\\\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the\\nsewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an\\nisomorphism of vector spaces $$\\\\int^{\\\\mathbb{M}\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Mod}(\\\\mathbb\\nV^{\\\\otimes R})}\\\\mathscr T_{\\\\mathfrak F}^*(\\\\mathbb\\nM\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{W})\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb C} \\\\mathscr T_{\\\\mathfrak G}^*(\\\\mathbb\\nM'\\\\otimes \\\\mathbb X)\\\\simeq\\\\mathscr T_{\\\\mathfrak X}^*(\\\\mathbb W\\\\otimes \\\\mathbb\\nX)$$\\n  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular\\nfunctors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\\\\mathbb V$ is\\nstrongly finite and rigid.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math-ph,math.MP,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:13:27Z\"}"}
