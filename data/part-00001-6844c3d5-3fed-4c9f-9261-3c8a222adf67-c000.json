{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23914v1\", \"title\": \"Scenarios for the Deployment of Automated Vehicles in Europe\", \"summary\": \"The deployment of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is expected to address road\\ntransport externalities (e.g., safety, traffic, environmental impact, etc.).\\nFor this reason, a legal framework for their large-scale market introduction\\nand deployment is currently being developed in the European Union. Despite the\\nfirst steps towards road transport automation, the timeline for full automation\\nand its potential economic benefits remains uncertain. The aim of this paper is\\ntwofold. First, it presents a methodological framework to determine deployment\\npathways of the five different levels of automation in EU27+UK to 2050 under\\nthree scenarios (i.e., slow, medium baseline and fast) focusing on passenger\\nvehicles. Second, it proposes an assessment of the economic impact of AVs\\nthrough the calculation of the value-added. The method to define assumptions\\nand uptake trajectories involves a comprehensive literature review, expert\\ninterviews, and a model to forecast the new registrations of different levels\\nof automation. In this way, the interviews provided insights that complemented\\nthe literature and informed the design of assumptions and deployment\\ntrajectories. The added-value assessment shows additional economic activity due\\nto the introduction of automated technologies in all uptake scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.GN\", \"categories\": \"econ.GN,q-fin.EC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:06:27Z\"}"}
