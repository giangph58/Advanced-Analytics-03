{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06192v1\", \"title\": \"Magnetization process in epitaxial Fe$_{85}$Co$_{15}$ thin films via\\n  anisotropic magnetoresistance\", \"summary\": \"The effects of the crystalline symmetry on the magnetotransport properties in\\nferromagnetic alloys are being reexamined in recent years particularly due to\\nthe role of the anisotropic magnetoresistance on the electrical detection of\\nmagnetization dynamics, which is relevant to estimate spin transport parameters\\nsuch as the spin Hall angle or the damping constant. In this work we\\ninvestigated the crystalline dependent anisotropic magnetoresistance in\\nepitaxial Fe85Co15 films and discuss the magnetization process through the\\nmagnetotransport properties by varying the relative orientations between the\\nelectric current, the external magnetic field and the Fe85Co15 crystallographic\\ndirections. We have found that the anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio depends\\non the current direction with respect to the crystal axes of Fe85Co15 and\\ndetermine a ratio of 0.20 % and 0.17 % when the current is applied along the\\n[110] hard and [100] easy axes, respectively. We fit our experimental data\\nusing the Stoner-Wohlfarth model to describe the path followed by the\\nmagnetization during the magnetization process and to extract the anisotropy\\nconstants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = 21 kJ/m3\\nand Ku = 11 kJ/m3, which are comparable with reported values from the angular\\nvariation of ferromagnetic resonance experiments. Our results contribute to the\\nunderstanding of the interplay between the crystalline structure and the\\nmagnetotransport properties of FeCo alloys.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:35:07Z\"}"}
