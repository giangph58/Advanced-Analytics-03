{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01720v1\", \"title\": \"Input-Erasing Two-Way Finite Automata\", \"summary\": \"The present paper introduces and studies an alternative concept of two-way\\nfinite automata called input-erasing two-way finite automata. Like the original\\nmodel, these new automata can also move the reading head freely left or right\\non the input tape. However, each time they read a symbol, they also erase it\\nfrom the tape. The paper demonstrates that these automata define precisely the\\nfamily of linear languages and are thus strictly stronger than the original\\nones. Furthermore, it introduces a variety of restrictions placed upon these\\nautomata and the way they work and investigates the effect of these\\nrestrictions on their acceptance power. In particular, it explores the mutual\\nrelations of language families resulting from some of these restrictions and\\nshows that some of them reduce the power of these automata to that of even\\nlinear grammars or even ordinary finite automata.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.FL\", \"categories\": \"cs.FL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:28:01Z\"}"}
