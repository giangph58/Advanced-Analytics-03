{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01703v1\", \"title\": \"Computable Bounds on the Solution to Poisson's Equation for General\\n  Harris Chains\", \"summary\": \"Poisson's equation is fundamental to the study of Markov chains, and arises\\nin connection with martingale representations and central limit theorems for\\nadditive functionals, perturbation theory for stationary distributions, and\\naverage reward Markov decision process problems. In this paper, we develop a\\nnew probabilistic representation for the solution of Poisson's equation, and\\nuse Lyapunov functions to bound this solution representation explicitly. In\\ncontrast to most prior work on this problem, our bounds are computable. Our\\ncontribution is closely connected to recent work of Herve and Ledoux (2025), in\\nwhich they focus their study on a special class of Harris chains satisfying a\\nparticular small set condition. However, our theory covers general Harris\\nchains, and often provides a tighter bound. In addition to the new bound and\\nrepresentation, we also develop a computable uniform bound on marginal\\nexpectations for Harris chains, and a computable bound on the potential kernel\\nrepresentation of the solution to Poisson's equation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:06:09Z\"}"}
