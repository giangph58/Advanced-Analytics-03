As a corollary we deduce that the set of zeros of prime power\\norder controls the degree of such a character. The same problem is analysed for\\nalternating groups, where we show that when $p=2$ this data can only be\\ndetermined up to two possibilities. We prove analogous statements for the\\ndefect of the $p$-block containing the character and for the $p$-height of the\\ncharacter.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RT\", \"categories\": \"math.RT,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:27:25Z\"}"}
