In\\nour study, the $\\\\Xi_b\\\\rightarrow \\\\Xi_c$ transition form factors are calculated\\nusing several popular models for baryonic light-cone distribution amplitudes\\n(LCDAs). These form factors are then employed to analyze a range of observable\\nquantities for the semileptonic processes via the helicity formalism. Our work\\npresents predictions for the branching fractions of these decays for both the\\n$\\\\tau$ and $e$ channels. Notably, the obtained lepton flavor universality\\nratio, $\\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\Xi_c}\\\\approx 0.3$, may offer new insights into the\\n$\\\\mathcal{R}^{(*)}$ puzzle. Furthermore, we investigate various angular\\nobservables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity\\nparameters, and polarization asymmetries, which provide complementary\\ninformation regarding potential new physics in $b$-baryonic semileptonic\\ntransitions. The numerical results for these angular observables are presented\\nas both functions of $q^2$ and as averaged values. We observe that the lepton\\nmass plays a significant role in shaping the angular distributions, affecting\\nmost of the observables under consideration. These results are expected to be\\nvaluable for both current and future experimental investigations of\\nsemileptonic heavy-to-heavy baryon decays.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:10:31Z\"}"}
