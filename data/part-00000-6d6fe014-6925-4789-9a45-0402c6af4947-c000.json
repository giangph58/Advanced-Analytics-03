Our\\narchitecture integrates target-selection with target-driving through Proximal\\nPolicy Optimization, overcoming discrete-action constraints of previous Deep\\nQ-Network approaches and enabling smoother agent trajectories. This model-free\\nframework effectively solves the shepherding problem without prior dynamics\\nknowledge. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and scalability\\nwith increased target numbers and limited sensing capabilities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.MA,cs.SY,eess.SY,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:56:57Z\"}"}
