{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06202v1\", \"title\": \"Up-to-constants estimates on four-arm events for simple conformal loop\\n  ensemble\", \"summary\": \"We prove up-to-constants estimates for a general class of four-arm events in\\nsimple conformal loop ensembles, i.e. CLE$_\\\\kappa$ for $\\\\kappa\\\\in (8/3,4]$. The\\nfour-arm events that we consider can be created by either one or two loops,\\nwith no constraint on the topology of the crossings. Our result is a key input\\nin our series of works arxiv:2409.16230 and arxiv:2409.16273 on percolation of\\nthe two-sided level sets in the discrete Gaussian free field (and level sets in\\nthe occupation field of the random walk loop soup).\\n  In order to get rid of all constraints on the topology of the crossings, we\\nrely on the Brownian loop-soup representation of simple CLE [Ann. Math. 176\\n(2012) 1827-1917], and a \\\"cluster version\\\" of a separation lemma for the\\nBrownian loop soup. As a corollary, we also obtain up-to-constants estimates\\nfor a general version of four-arm events for SLE$_\\\\kappa$ for $\\\\kappa\\\\in\\n(8/3,4]$. This fixes (in the case of four arms and $\\\\kappa\\\\in(8/3,4]$) an\\nessential gap in [Ann.
