{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01368v1\", \"title\": \"Proton cumulants from hydrodynamics in light of new STAR data\", \"summary\": \"New measurements of proton number cumulants from the Beam Energy Scan Phase\\nII (BES-II) program at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration provide unprecedented\\nprecision and insights into the properties of strongly interacting matter. This\\nreport discusses the measurements in the context of predictions from\\nhydrodynamics, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of factorial cumulants and\\ntheir implications for the search for the QCD critical point. The experimental\\ndata shows enhancement of second-order factorial cumulants and suppression of\\nthird-order factorial cumulants relative to the non-critical baseline at $7.7 <\\n\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm NN}} \\\\lesssim 10$ GeV. We discuss implications of this observation\\nfor the possible location of the critical point in the QCD phase diagram and\\nopportunities for future measurements of acceptance dependence of factorial\\ncumulants.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-ph,nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:28:27Z\"}"}
