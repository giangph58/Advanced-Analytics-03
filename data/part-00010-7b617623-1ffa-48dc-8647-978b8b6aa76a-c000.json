{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02643v1\", \"title\": \"A Dynamic, Ordinal Gaussian Process Item Response Theoretic Model\", \"summary\": \"Social scientists are often interested in using ordinal indicators to\\nestimate latent traits that change over time. Frequently, this is done with\\nitem response theoretic (IRT) models that describe the relationship between\\nthose latent traits and observed indicators. We combine recent advances in\\nBayesian nonparametric IRT, which makes minimal assumptions on shapes of item\\nresponse functions, and Gaussian process time series methods to capture dynamic\\nstructures in latent traits from longitudinal observations. We propose a\\ngeneralized dynamic Gaussian process item response theory (GD-GPIRT) as well as\\na Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for estimation of both latent\\ntraits and response functions. We evaluate GD-GPIRT in simulation studies\\nagainst baselines in dynamic IRT, and apply it to various substantive studies,\\nincluding assessing public opinions on economy environment and congressional\\nideology related to abortion debate.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:37:26Z\"}"}
