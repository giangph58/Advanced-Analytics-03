A central\\nchallenge lies in determining the maximum number of labelled trees over $n$\\nnodes with pairwise distance at least $d$, denoted by $A(n,d)$, where the\\ndistance between any two labelled trees is the minimum number of edit edge\\noperations in order to transform one tree to another. By various tools from\\ngraph theory and algebra, we show that when $n$ is large,\\n$A(n,d)=O((Cn)^{n-d})$ for any $d\\\\leq n-2$, and $A(n,d)=\\\\Omega((cn)^{n-d})$ for\\nany $d$ linear with $n$, where constants $c\\\\in(0,1)$ and $C\\\\in [1/2,1)$\\ndepending on $d$. Previously, only $A(n,d)=O(n^{n-d-1})$ for fixed $d$ and\\n$A(n,d)=\\\\Omega(n^{n-2d})$ for $d\\\\leq n/2$ were known, while the upper bound is\\nimproved for any $d$ and the lower bound is improved for $d\\\\geq 2\\\\sqrt{n}$.\\nFurther, for any fixed integer $k$, we prove the existence of codes of size\\n$\\\\Omega(n^k)$ when $n-d=o(n)$, and give explicit constructions of codes which\\nshow $A(n,n-4)=\\\\Omega(n^2)$ and $A(n,n-13)=\\\\Omega(n^3)$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:35:21Z\"}"}
