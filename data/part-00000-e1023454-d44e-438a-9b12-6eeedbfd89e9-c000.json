{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24356v1\", \"title\": \"Single-Shot Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Optical Tensor Processor for\\n  Deep Learning\", \"summary\": \"The ever-increasing data demand craves advancements in high-speed and\\nenergy-efficient computing hardware. Analog optical neural network (ONN)\\nprocessors have emerged as a promising solution, offering benefits in bandwidth\\nand energy consumption. However, existing ONN processors exhibit limited\\ncomputational parallelism, and while certain architectures achieve high\\nparallelism, they encounter serious scaling roadblocks for large-scale\\nimplementation. This restricts the throughput, latency, and energy efficiency\\nadvantages of ONN processors. Here, we introduce a spatial-wavelength-temporal\\nhyper-multiplexed ONN processor that supports high data dimensionality, high\\ncomputing parallelism and is feasible for large-scale implementation, and in a\\nsingle time step, a three-dimensional matrix-matrix multiplication (MMM)\\noptical tensor processor is demonstrated. Our hardware accelerates\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) through\\nparallel matrix multiplication. We demonstrate benchmark image recognition\\nusing a CNN and a subsequently fully connected DNN in the optical domain. The\\nnetwork works with 292,616 weight parameters under ultra-low optical energy of\\n20 attojoules (aJ) per multiply and accumulate (MAC) at 96.4% classification\\naccuracy. The system supports broad spectral and spatial bandwidths and is\\ncapable for large-scale demonstration, paving the way for highly efficient\\nlarge-scale optical computing for next-generation deep learning.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:35:48Z\"}"}
