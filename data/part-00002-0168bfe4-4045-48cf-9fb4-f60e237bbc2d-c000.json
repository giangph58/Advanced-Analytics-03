{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06038v1\", \"title\": \"Unimodular Waveform Design that Minimizes PSL of Ambiguity Function over\\n  A Continuous Doppler Frequency Shift Region of Interest\", \"summary\": \"In active sensing systems, waveforms with ambiguity functions (AFs) of low\\npeak sidelobe levels (PSLs) across a time delay and Doppler frequency shift\\nplane (delay-Doppler plane) of interest are desirable for reducing false\\nalarms. Additionally, unimodular waveforms are preferred due to hardware\\nlimitations. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular\\nwaveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift\\nregion, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with\\nexisting methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane\\nby using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization\\nproblem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts\\nobserved in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous\\nrather than discrete. The problem of interest is formulated as an optimization\\nproblem with infinite constraints along with unimodular constraints. To the\\nbest of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been studied yet. We\\npropose to reformulate a non-convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) to a\\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) with a finite number of constraints and a\\nrank-one constraint, which is then solved by the sequential rank-one constraint\\nrelaxation (SROCR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\\nmethod outperforms existing methods in achieving a lower PSL of AF over a\\ncontinuous Doppler frequency shift region of interest. Moreover, the designed\\nwaveform can effectively prevent false alarms when detecting a target with an\\narbitrary velocity.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T13:37:22Z\"}"}
