AMS 1987] and\\nKobourov and Landis [JGAA 2006]. Specifically, we describe two methods to morph\\nshortest-path triangulations of the sphere by moving their vertices along\\nlongitudes into the southern hemisphere; we call a triangulation sinkable if\\nsuch a morph exists. Our first method generalizes a longitudinal shelling\\nconstruction of Awartani and Henderson; a triangulation is sinkable if a\\nspecific orientation of its dual graph is acyclic. We describe a simple\\npolynomial-time algorithm to find a longitudinally shellable rotation of a\\ngiven spherical triangulation, if one exists; we also construct a spherical\\ntriangulation that has no longitudinally shellable rotation. Our second method\\nis based on a linear-programming characterization of sinkability. By\\nidentifying its optimal basis, we show that this linear program can be solved\\nin $O(n^{\\\\omega/2})$ time, where $\\\\omega$ is the matrix-multiplication\\nexponent, assuming the underlying linear system is non-singular. Finally, we\\npose several conjectures and describe experimental results that support them.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:04:56Z\"}"}
