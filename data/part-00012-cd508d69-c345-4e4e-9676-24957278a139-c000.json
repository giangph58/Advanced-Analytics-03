In this work, we provide a\\ncomprehensive and pedagogical discussion on how to practically implement these\\ncontinuously parameterized M{\\\\o}lmer-S{\\\\o}rensen gates on the Quantum\\nScientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT), a low-level trapped-ion\\nprocessor. To generate the arbitrary entangling angles, $\\\\theta$, we simply\\nscale the amplitude of light used to generate the entanglement. However, doing\\nso requires careful consideration of amplifier saturation as well as the\\nvariable light shifts that result. As such, we describe a method to calibrate\\nand cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic virtual\\nphase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a\\nlinear scaling between $\\\\theta$ and the residual light shift. Once, we have\\nconsidered and calibrated these effects, we demonstrate performance improvement\\nwith decreasing $\\\\theta$. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware control to\\ntransform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle M{\\\\o}lmer-S{\\\\o}rensen\\ngate into a phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:59:10Z\"}"}
