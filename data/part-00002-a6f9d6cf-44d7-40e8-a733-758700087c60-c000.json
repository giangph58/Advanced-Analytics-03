Human recordings\\nincur high costs and privacy concerns, while synthetic approaches often lack\\nconversational authenticity. To address these challenges, we introduce\\n\\\\textsc{SpeechDialogueFactory}, a production-ready framework for generating\\nnatural speech dialogues efficiently. Our solution employs a comprehensive\\npipeline including metadata generation, dialogue scripting,\\nparalinguistic-enriched utterance simulation, and natural speech synthesis with\\nvoice cloning. Additionally, the system provides an interactive UI for detailed\\nsample inspection and a high-throughput batch synthesis mode. Evaluations show\\nthat dialogues generated by our system achieve a quality comparable to human\\nrecordings while significantly reducing production costs. We release our work\\nas an open-source toolkit, alongside example datasets available in English and\\nChinese, empowering researchers and developers in Speech-LLM research and\\ndevelopment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:52:21Z\"}"}
