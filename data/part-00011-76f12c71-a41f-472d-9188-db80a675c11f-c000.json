{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05059v1\", \"title\": \"MIAT: Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer for Spatio-Temporal\\n  Trajectory Prediction\", \"summary\": \"Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for safe and efficient\\nautonomous driving, especially in mixed traffic environments with both\\nhuman-driven and autonomous vehicles. However, uncertainties introduced by\\ninherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and\\nright maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory\\nprediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT)\\narchitecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with\\nspatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory\\npredictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of\\nmaneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions.\\nEvaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various\\ntransformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up\\nto 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions\\ncompared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an\\nintention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost\\nin long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:30:00Z\"}"}
