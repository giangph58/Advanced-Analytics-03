{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02757v1\", \"title\": \"Echoes of the hidden: Uncovering coordination beyond network structure\", \"summary\": \"The study of connectivity and coordination has drawn increasing attention in\\nrecent decades due to their central role in driving markets, shaping societal\\ndynamics, and influencing biological systems. Traditionally, observable\\nconnections, such as phone calls, financial transactions, or social media\\nconnections, have been used to infer coordination and connectivity. However,\\nincomplete, encrypted, or fragmented data, alongside the ubiquity of\\ncommunication platforms and deliberate obfuscation, often leave many real-world\\nconnections hidden. In this study, we demonstrate that coordinating individuals\\nexhibit shared bursty activity patterns, enabling their detection even when\\nobservable links between them are sparse or entirely absent. We further propose\\na generative model based on the network of networks formalism to account for\\nthe mechanisms driving this collaborative burstiness, attributing it to shock\\npropagation across networks rather than isolated individual behavior. Model\\nsimulations demonstrate that when observable connection density is below 70\\\\%,\\nburstiness significantly improves coordination detection compared to\\nstate-of-the-art temporal and structural methods. This work provides a new\\nperspective on community and coordination dynamics, advancing both theoretical\\nunderstanding and practical detection. By laying the foundation for identifying\\nhidden connections beyond observable network structures, it enables detection\\nacross different platforms, alongside enhancing system behavior understanding,\\ninformed decision-making, and risk mitigation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:49:58Z\"}"}
