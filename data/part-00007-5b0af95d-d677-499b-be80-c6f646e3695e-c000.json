The new\\nresults reduce the Mathieu Conjecture on $SU(N)$ (formulated for all compact\\nconnected Lie groups by O. Mathieu in 1997) to a conjecture involving only\\nfunctions on $\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\times (S^1)^m$ with $n,m$ non-negative integers\\ninstead of involving functions on $\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\times (S^1\\\\setminus\\\\{1\\\\})^m$.\\nThe proofs rely on a more recent work of the author (2024) and a specific $KAK$\\ndecomposition. Finally, with these results we can also improve the results on\\nthe groups $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$ in the latter paper, since they relied on the\\nconstruction introduced in the 2023 paper.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:00:47Z\"}"}
