Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as\nthe predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant\nfocus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics.\nCurrent orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering\nonly the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent\ndemand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly\nleveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of\nforecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and\nefficiency.","main_category":"physics.med-ph","categories":"physics.med-ph,cs.NA,math.NA","published":"2025-03-31T15:13:36Z"}

In this work, we show that the universality of KNO scaling can be\nextended to hadron-hadron collisions when restricted to QCD jets. We present a\ncomprehensive study of KNO scaling in QCD jets produced in proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC. Using perturbative QCD calculations in the double\nlogarithmic approximation and PYTHIA simulations, we find that KNO scaling\napproximately holds for both quark and gluon jets across a broad jet $p_T$\nrange, from $0.1$ TeV to $2.5$ TeV, at both the parton and hadron levels.\nEspecially, we highlight characteristic differences between the KNO scaling\nfunctions of quark and gluon jets, with the quark-jet scaling function lying\nabove that of gluon jets at both low and high multiplicities. This distinction\nis essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC. Furthermore, we\npropose direct experimental tests of KNO scaling in QCD jets at the LHC through\nquark-gluon discrimination using jet substructure techniques, as demonstrated\nby applying energy correlation functions to PYTHIA-generated data.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-th","published":"2025-03-31T15:18:24Z"}

To address this\nchallenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system\nas an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce\nphysics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the\necho state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic\nsystems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo\nstate network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, our\nmodels exhibit robustness to noise in training data and remain effective even\nwhen prior coupling knowledge is imperfect. This approach has the potential to\nenhance other machine learning methods.","main_category":"nlin.CD","categories":"nlin.CD,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-02T09:19:33Z"}

For example, for an intelligent robot, it is necessary to\naccurately ground the affordance of an object and grasp it according to human\ninstructions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task that grounds 3D object\naffordance based on language instructions, visual observations and\ninteractions, which is inspired by cognitive science. We collect an Affordance\nGrounding dataset with Points, Images and Language instructions (AGPIL) to\nsupport the proposed task. In the 3D physical world, due to observation\norientation, object rotation, or spatial occlusion, we can only get a partial\nobservation of the object. So this dataset includes affordance estimations of\nobjects from full-view, partial-view, and rotation-view perspectives. To\naccomplish this task, we propose LMAffordance3D, the first multi-modal,\nlanguage-guided 3D affordance grounding network, which applies a\nvision-language model to fuse 2D and 3D spatial features with semantic\nfeatures.

The\napplications in nuclear environments require radiation resistance. The\ncharacteristics of Ge-doped MM fibers are investigated for Radiation Induced\nAttenuation (RIA) in Total Ionizing Dose (TID).\n  Methods: Commercial samples of Ge-doped MM fibers were irradiated in Go-60\ngamma rays at dose rates of 5 to 1.4k Gy(SiO2)/hr. The fiber samples were\npackaged in water tanks maintained at constant temperatures in the range of -15\nto 45 degC. The optical power transmitted through the fibers were recorded in\nirradiation, and in annealing when the source was shielded. The measurements of\nRIA in time are analyzed for dose rate and temperature dependences.\n  Results: Ge-doped fiber samples of OM2 to OM4 grades were investigated for\nattenuation of optical power in radiation ionizing dose. Depending on the\nfabrication technology, two of the fiber types show radiation resistance with\nthe RIAs of 0.2 dB/m and 0.05 dB/m, respectively, for the TID of 300 kGy(SiO2).\nAt low dose rate of 5 Gy/hr, the RIA increases steadily and the annealing of\nlow density ionizing defects does not cause notable deviation. At 1.4 kGy/hr\nthe accumulated defects result to twice higher RIA during irradiation, and is\nworsen to a factor three in cold temperature.

In the testing phase, they\nidentify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To\nlearn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and\ntrain a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to\nreconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution.\nDeviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which\nindicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably\ncauses information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal\nreconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we\npropose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D\nbrain MRI.

Here, we integrate space-based\nsolar power (SBSP) -- a potential near-constant, orbital solar technology --\ninto a high-resolution, Europe-wide capacity-expansion and dispatch model to\nquantify its contribution under net-zero constraints. We examine two advanced\nSBSP designs: (1) a near-baseload, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) concept\n(heliostat-based Representative Design RD1) and (2) a partially intermittent,\nhigher-TRL concept (planar-based RD2), both drawing on NASA's 2050 cost and\nperformance projections. Our results show that RD1 can reduce total system\ncosts by 7--15%, displace up to 80% of intermittent wind and solar, and cut\nbattery usage by over 70%, if it meets its forecast cost reductions -- though\nlong-duration storage (e.g., hydrogen) remains essential for seasonal\nbalancing. By contrast, RD2 is economically unattractive at its projected 2050\ncosts. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, we identify cost thresholds at\nwhich SBSP shifts from cost-prohibitive to complementary and ultimately to a\ndominant baseload technology.

When information on the cause of death is unavailable or\nunreliable, the Relative Survival (RS) framework is the preferred approach for\nestimating Net Survival, which represents survival in a hypothetical scenario\nwhere the disease of interest is the only possible cause of death. In the\ncontext of cancer, RS often reaches a plateau, indicating that a portion of\ndiagnosed patients is cured, as they have the same risk of dying as a\ncomparable group of healthy individuals with similar demographic\ncharacteristics. Classical RS cure models use logistic regression to estimate\nthe fraction of cured patients. However, this functional form is somewhat\narbitrary, and misspecifying it can severely distort the resulting cure\nindicators. Consequently, evaluations of the efficacy of cancer treatments at\nthe population level could be inaccurate, leading to biased decision-making\nregarding patient care.

We disentangled the spectra using Korel and performed spectral\nsynthesis with Atlas9 and Synthe codes. The system was modelled using Korel and\nPhoebe2.4. We also employed SED fitting in Ariadne and isochrone fitting using\nParam1.5 codes. Our findings indicate that the non-eclipsing system (with an\ninclination of 49.9(8) deg) 50 Dra, displaying ellipsoidal brightness\nvariations, consists of two nearly equal A-type stars with masses of\n$M_{1}=2.08(8)$ and $M_{2}=1.97(8)$ M$_{\\odot}$ and temperatures of 9800(100)\nand 9200(200) K, respectively. Our analysis also suggests that the system, with\nan orbital period of $P_{\\rm orb}=4.117719(2)$ days, is tidally relaxed with a\ncircular orbit and synchronous rotation of the components. Furthermore, we\ndiscovered that both stars are metallic-line Am chemically peculiar stars with\nan underabundance of Sc and an overabundance of iron-peak and rare-earth\nelements. We identified additional variations with slightly higher frequency\nthan the rotational frequency of the components that we interpret as prograde\ng-mode pulsations. The system 50 Dra exhibits numerous exciting phenomena that\nco-exist together and may have an impact on our understanding of chemical\npeculiarity and pulsations.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-08T09:32:49Z"}

A\nstandard approach to solving this problem constructs a product MC of the given\nMC and DFA, reducing the task to a simple reachability probability problem on\nthe resulting product MC.\n  In this paper, on top of our recent development of coalgebraic framework, we\nfirst present a no-go theorem for product constructions, showing a case when we\ncannot do product constructions for model checking.

However, the performance gap compared with fully-supervised\nalgorithms remains large. Previous works generated class-agnostic\n\\textbf{\\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed\ncandidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning\n(MIL). In this paper, we introduce Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which\nconstructs balanced \\textbf{\\textit{instance-level proposal bags}} by\ngenerating proposals in an anchor-like way and refining the proposals in a\ncoarse-to-fine paradigm. Through further research, we find that the bag of\nproposals, either at the image level or the instance level, is established on\ndiscrete box sampling. This leads the pseudo box estimation into a sub-optimal\nsolution, resulting in the truncation of object boundaries or the excessive\ninclusion of background. Hence, we conduct a series exploration of\ndiscrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask\nNetwork (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal\nsampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues. P2MNet further introduces\nlow-level image information to assist in pixel prediction, and a boundary\nself-prediction is designed to relieve the limitation of the estimated boxes.\nBenefiting from the continuous object-aware \\textbf{\\textit{pixel-level\nperception}}, P2MNet can generate more precise bounding boxes and generalize to\nsegmentation tasks.

Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is\ncrucial for language models of different sizes and applications. One of the\nmost widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag;\nhowever, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues.\nThese issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading\nprompts or equally correct options. Furthermore, we show that if models are\nevaluated only on answer texts, or with \"Lorem ipsum dolor...\" instead of the\nquestion, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot\nbe attributed merely to contamination. Since benchmark scores are an essential\npart of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these\nvalidity issues can have severe consequences. In particular, knowing that\ntaking benchmark scores at face value is ubiquitous, inadequate evaluation\nleads to ill-informed decisions about models. In this paper, we thoroughly\ninvestigate critical validity issues posed by HellaSwag and illustrate them\nwith various evaluations using generative language models of different sizes.\nWe argue that this benchmark does not accurately measure common-sense reasoning\nand, therefore, should not be used for evaluation in its current state.

Most existing\nstudies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational\ncontexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational\ncontexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational\ncontexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user\npreference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a\ncertain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling\nstoryline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt\nlearning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image\nfeatures of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture\nhigher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities\n(collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph\nstructures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal\nsemantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language\nmodels to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly\nimproves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and\ncontextually relevant content in response generation.

To handle these issues, we propose the\never-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable,\nauto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic\nPolynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which\nprovides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can\ngenerate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver:\nwhich provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both\nonline and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and\niii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze\nthe performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha\nmoments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments\nover widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the\nperformances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that\nNPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the\nmost powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\no1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of\ntokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\nDeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem\ninstances become more and more difficult.

It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user\ninterfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary\nsequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions\nsuch as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as\nfilling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on\nsensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security\nrisks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent\nbehaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These\nattacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and\nhuman users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual\nintegrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such\nattacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six\nstate-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human\nparticipants.

We\npropose a novel method, Attentional Concept Erasure (ACE), that integrates a\nclosed-form attention manipulation with lightweight fine-tuning.

Existing methods mainly\nrely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and\nperform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of\nvideo. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes\nand multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the\noverall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change\nscenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we\npropose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a\ngiven complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user\ninstructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition\nactions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given\ncamera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the\ndiffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose\nCamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera\nmovements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to\nensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the\ngenerated video.

In these setups, a detector monitors the\ntarget site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked\nafter a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from\nthe time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked\nup to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional\nlattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\\alpha}$\nwith the distance $d$, for $\\alpha\\in(0,\\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays\nwith a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\\alpha$. At short\ntimes, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of\n$\\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal\nresetting rate.

The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR\nretrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions.\nResults: Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at\nthe red end of the NIRISS data.

However, fuzzy rule-based classifiers struggle to\nreach bigger traction outside of fuzzy venues, because users sometimes do not\nknow about fuzzy and because fuzzy partitions are not so easy to interpret in\nsome situations. In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce fuzzy\nrule-based classifiers to crisp rule-based classifiers.

However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant\nshortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU,\nIoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific\nmethods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As\na result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has\nbecome scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To\naddress this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by\nintroducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that\novercomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their\nunique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU. MGIoU offers a\nsimple, efficient, fully differentiable approximation strongly correlated with\nIoU. We then extend MGIoU to MGIoU+ that supports optimizing unstructured\nconvex shapes. Together, MGIoU and MGIoU+ unify parametric shape optimization\nacross diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MGIoU and MGIoU+ consistently outperform existing losses while reducing\nloss computation latency by 10-40x. Additionally, MGIoU and MGIoU+ satisfy\nmetric properties and scale-invariance, ensuring robustness as an objective\nfunction. We further propose MGIoU- for minimizing overlaps in tasks like\ncollision-free trajectory prediction.

However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps\nchallenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to\nintegrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment\nTransformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and\nalignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and\nglobal-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and\nbetween paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction\nand fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the\nTransformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial\npixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel\ndependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain\ndistribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature\nmisalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive\nAlignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in\na two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity.\nThis reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this\nunified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction\nof the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's\nrobustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-23T06:44:46Z"}

A Study with Context-Free Grammars","summary":"The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that\ndetermines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to\ninvoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at\nthe beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model\nto access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies\nhave reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained\nmodels in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in\nspecific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token\nprediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how\nprepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining\nits behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach\nproduces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We\ndemonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent\nsemantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically,\nthrough investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free\ngrammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance\nwhen the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In\ncontrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks\nthe necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-24T13:56:43Z"}

By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior\ntheoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 /\n\\ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave\nquasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \\ell$ grows as $T^3$,\nin agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave\nsuperconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer\nmercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the\nmean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered\ncounterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed\nto the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more\npristine inner plane.

However, we observe that RGB images\noften lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity\nfor geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases\nassociated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled\ndual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key\nidea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture\nparts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the\nPrinciple of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with\ngeometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as\nexclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the\nnetwork's input and output. Moreover, we improve the mesh extraction algorithm\nto introduce 3D ground truth supervision. As for texture branch, we use RGB\nimages as input to obtain the textured mesh. Overall, DiMeR demonstrates robust\ncapabilities across various tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction,\nsingle-image-to-3D, and text-to-3D. Numerous experiments show that DiMeR\nsignificantly outperforms previous methods, achieving over 30% improvement in\nChamfer Distance on the GSO and OmniObject3D dataset.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-24T15:39:20Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17706v1","title":"Inverse problem in the LaMET framework","summary":"One proposal to compute parton distributions from first principles is the\nlarge momentum effective theory (LaMET), which requires the Fourier transform\nof matrix elements computed non-perturbatively. Lattice quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD) provides calculations of these matrix elements over a finite range of\nFourier harmonics that are often noisy or unreliable in the largest computed\nharmonics. It has been suggested that enforcing an exponential decay of the\nmissing harmonics helps alleviate this issue. Using non-perturbative data, we\nshow that the uncertainty introduced by this inverse problem in a realistic\nsetup remains significant without very restrictive assumptions, and that the\nimportance of the exact asymptotic behavior is minimal for values of $x$ where\nthe framework is currently applicable. We show that the crux of the inverse\nproblem lies in harmonics of the order of $\\lambda=zP_z \\sim 5-15$, where the\nsignal in the lattice data is often barely existent in current studies, and the\nasymptotic behavior is not firmly established. We stress the need for more\nsophisticated techniques to account for this inverse problem, whether in the\nLaMET or related frameworks like the short-distance factorization.
