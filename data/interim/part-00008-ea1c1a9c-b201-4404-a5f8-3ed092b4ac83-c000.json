Standard WSOL methods rely on class\nactivation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according\nto a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant\nprogress, they still face several limitations with histology images.\nSingle-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the\nlimited visual ROI saliency in histology images and the limited localization\ncues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between\nclassification and localization tasks. The two-step approach is sub-optimal\nbecause it is tied to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for\nlocalization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when applied to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for\nWSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the\nasynchronous convergence problem.

Among the interesting\nphenomena is the commonly observed dual-band emission, which has often been\ninterpreted by adopting the phenomenological model that explains the dual-band\nemission (``ultraviolet band'' and ``visible band'') in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$\n($L$ = Sc, Y, Lu). However, the model for Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series itself\nhas not been well understood theoretically. In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify\nthe underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped\n$L$PO$_{4}$ series. We demonstrate that the dual-band arises from two\nexcited-state equilibrium structures, one exhibits a relatively small\ndistortion with respect to the ground-state equilibrium structure, while the\nother displays a significantly larger distortion, characteristic of an\n``off-center'' configuration. The deviations from the ground-state\nconfiguration are dominated by two distinct vibrational modes, $b_2$ and $e$\nmodes, involving the Jahn-Teller effect and the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect,\nrespectively. Furthermore, charge transition levels and energy barriers\ncalculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method have\naided in understanding the relaxation between the two excited-state\nconfigurations and the property changes across the Sc, Y, and Lu series. These\ninsights provide a basis for understanding the exotic properties of Sb$^{3+}$\nin other hosts and may facilitate the design of optical materials in a broader\nrange of systems involving Sb$^{3+}$ ions.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-02T08:23:34Z"}

However, this development\nalso raises security concerns, as malicious actors exploit cross-chain asset\nflows to conceal the provenance and destination of assets, thereby facilitating\nillegal activities such as money laundering. Consequently, the need for\ncross-chain transaction traceability has become increasingly urgent. Prior\nresearch on transaction traceability has predominantly focused on single-chain\nand centralized finance (CeFi) cross-chain scenarios, overlooking DeFispecific\nconsiderations. This paper proposes ABCTRACER, an automated, bi-directional\ncross-chain transaction tracing tool, specifically designed for DeFi\necosystems. By harnessing transaction event log mining and named entity\nrecognition techniques, ABCTRACER automatically extracts explicit cross-chain\ncues. These cues are then combined with information retrieval techniques to\nencode implicit cues. ABCTRACER facilitates the autonomous learning of latent\nassociated information and achieves bidirectional, generalized cross-chain\ntransaction tracing. Our experiments on 12 mainstream cross-chain bridges\ndemonstrate that ABCTRACER attains 91.75% bi-directional traceability (F1\nmetrics) with self-adaptive capability. Furthermore, we apply ABCTRACER to\nreal-world cross-chain attack transactions and money laundering traceability,\nthereby bolstering the traceability and blockchain ecological security of DeFi\nbridging applications.","main_category":"cs.SE","categories":"cs.SE,cs.CR","published":"2025-04-02T15:28:25Z"}

Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple\ndiffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency\npreservation.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-03T17:59:58Z"}

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the\nuse of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering\nfunctionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss\ncoefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system.

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise.

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a\ntransmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor\nassembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot\nin a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium\ninductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF\nreflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need\nfor directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot\ncharge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of\nRF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is\nfound to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT.

However,\nexisting methods that rely on Euclidean space struggle to capture the rich\nhierarchical information inherent in textual and semantic data, which is\nessential for capturing user preferences. The geometric properties of\nhyperbolic space offer a promising solution to address this issue.\nNevertheless, integrating LLMs-based methods with hyperbolic space to\neffectively extract and incorporate diverse hierarchical information is\nnon-trivial. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named\nHyperLLM, which extracts and integrates hierarchical information from both\nstructural and semantic perspectives. Structurally, HyperLLM uses LLMs to\ngenerate multi-level classification tags with hierarchical parent-child\nrelationships for each item. Then, tag-item and user-item interactions are\njointly learned and aligned through contrastive learning, thereby providing the\nmodel with clear hierarchical information. Semantically, HyperLLM introduces a\nnovel meta-optimized strategy to extract hierarchical information from semantic\nembeddings and bridge the gap between the semantic and collaborative spaces for\nseamless integration. Extensive experiments show that HyperLLM significantly\noutperforms recommender systems based on hyperbolic space and LLMs, achieving\nperformance improvements of over 40%. Furthermore, HyperLLM not only improves\nrecommender performance but also enhances training stability, highlighting the\ncritical role of hierarchical information in recommender systems.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-08T05:35:38Z"}

Since existing benchmarks\nmay be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency\non novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems.

The key insight is to build\npolynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with\ntwo additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with\nthe \"non-standard\" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the\nRLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The\nresulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with\nmachine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding\nmode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest\nmode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the\nsystem's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded\nresult, and restores the application's rounding mode.

We investigate the physical implications of\nthis phenomenon. In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two\nelectromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of\nthe two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when\nlinear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the\ntotal polarization degree conserved. However, incoherent superposition can lead\nto depolarization. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent\nsuperposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be\ncomparable when jumps occur, placing constraints on the intrinsic radiation\nmechanisms. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation\nmechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps\nby generating two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a\ngeometric effect due to sweeping line-of-sight is a more plausible reason. This\nrequires the emission region to be within the magnetosphere of a spinning\ncentral engine, likely a magnetar. The two orthogonal modes may be produced by\nintrinsic radiation mechanisms or Alfv\\'en-O-mode transition. Plasma\nbirefringence is not easy to achieve when the plasma is moving\nrelativistically. Curvature radiation predicts $|E_{\\rm X}/E_{\\rm O}|\\gtrsim1$,\nand is difficult to produce jumps; whereas inverse Compton scattering can\nachieve the transition amplitude ratio $|E_{\\rm X}/E_{\\rm O}|=1$ to allow jumps\nto occur under special geometric configurations.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-10T04:48:50Z"}

These\nCA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed\nrelationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential\naspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance,\nwalking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but\ndiffer in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related.\nConsequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these\ninherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels\ntypically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is\nunavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this\nlimitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity\nlabels to capture semantic relationships. LMs generate vector embeddings that\npreserve rich semantic information from natural language. Our SEAL approach\nencodes input-time series sensor data from smart devices and their associated\nactivity and context labels (text) as vector embeddings.

While traditional\nanonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data\nutility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal\nprivacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied\nnaively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human\npose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance,\nwe adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a\nlow-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and\nefficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a\nlightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment\nfeasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable\nfor multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and\nunderstanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the\nsemantic meaning required for downstream applications.

The discrete Boltzmann method\n(DBM) provides a multiscale kinetic modeling framework and analysis tool to\ncapture complex discrete/nonequilibrium effects. While the numerical scheme\nplays a fundamental role in DBM simulations, a comprehensive stability analysis\nremains lacking. Similar to LBM, the complexity mainly arises from the\nintrinsic coupling between velocity and spatiotemporal discretizations,\ncompared with CFD. This study applies von Neumann stability analysis to\ninvestigate key factors influencing DBM simulation stability, including\nphase-space discretization, thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) levels,\nspatiotemporal schemes, initial conditions, and model parameters. Key findings\ninclude: (i) the moment-matching approach outperforms expansion- and\nweighting-based methods in the test simulations; (ii) increased TNE enhances\nsystem nonlinearity and the intrinsic nonlinearity embedded in the model\nequations, amplifying instabilities; (iii) additional viscous dissipation based\non distribution functions improves stability but distorts flow fields and\nalters constitutive relations; (iv) larger CFL numbers and relative time steps\ndegrade stability, necessitating appropriate time-stepping strategies.

Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational\ncomplexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift\ntowards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing\nEuclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle\ninequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To\naddress this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating\nnon-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory\nrepresentation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic\nspace to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in\nEuclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz\ndistance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints.\nAdditionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly\nintegrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning\npipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh\nfunction to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical\nfoundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that\nintelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across\ndifferent trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for\nmore robust similarity calculations.

Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual\nscenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural\ninformation, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish\nknown nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in\ntransductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge,\nwe propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces\nautomatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal\npositional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each\nnode's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a\nstandard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances\ntransductive accuracy with inductive generalisation.

We take pyrene as an\nexample PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects\nthe applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in\nIR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra\ngenerated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR\nspectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared\nMultiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a\nmachine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle\naccuracies while keeping low computational costs.

Introducing parallel compliance in\nquadrupedal design is deemed to enhance locomotion performance, which, however,\nmakes the control task even harder. This work aims to address this challenge by\nproposing a general template model and establishing an efficient motion\nplanning and control pipeline. To start, we propose a reduced-order template\nmodel-the dual-legged actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum with trunk\nrotation-which explicitly models parallel compliance by decoupling spring\neffects from active motor actuation. With this template model, versatile\nacrobatic motions, such as pronking, froggy jumping, and hop-turn, are\ngenerated by a dual-layer trajectory optimization, where the singularity-free\nbody rotation representation is taken into consideration. Integrated with a\nlinear singularity-free tracking controller, enhanced quadrupedal locomotion is\nachieved. Comparisons with the existing template model reveal the improved\naccuracy and generalization of our model.

However,\nexisting approaches often overlook the quality variations in local features and\nfail to fully leverage the complementary information across modalities,\nparticularly in the case of low-quality features. In this paper, we propose to\naddress this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the\nModality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first\nconstruct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between\npatches. Subsequently, the selective graph nodes swap operation is employed to\nalleviate the adverse effects of low-quality local features by considering both\nlocal and global information, enhancing the representation of discriminative\ninformation.

Another advantage of the proposed\ngraph reasoning approach is its ability to reconstruct missing modal\ninformation by exploiting inherent structural relationships, thereby minimizing\ndisparities between different modalities.

This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both\ntarget labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain\nadaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data,\ntime series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source\ntime series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply\nfine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose\nthe learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal\npatterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to\ndisentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional\narchitecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a\nU-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the\ninitial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step\nto prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer\nadaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a\nresidual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation\nbranch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's\noutput. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their\ncomposition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is\ndisentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is\nretained.

In this\npaper, we investigate two fundamental rank aggregation tasks under the\nwell-studied Ulam metric: computing a median permutation (which minimizes the\nsum of Ulam distances to X) and computing a center permutation (which minimizes\nthe maximum Ulam distance to X) in two settings.\n  $\\bullet$ Continuous Setting: In the continuous setting, the median/center is\nallowed to be any permutation. It is known that computing a center in the Ulam\nmetric is NP-hard and we add to this by showing that computing a median is\nNP-hard as well via a simple reduction from the Max-Cut problem. While this\nresult may not be unexpected, it had remained elusive until now and confirms a\nspeculation by Chakraborty, Das, and Krauthgamer [SODA '21].\n  $\\bullet$ Discrete Setting: In the discrete setting, the median/center must\nbe a permutation from the input set. We fully resolve the fine-grained\ncomplexity of the discrete median and discrete center problems under the Ulam\nmetric, proving that the naive $\\widetilde{O}(n^2 L)$-time algorithm (where L\nis the length of the permutation) is conditionally optimal. This resolves an\nopen problem raised by Abboud, Bateni, Cohen-Addad, Karthik C. S., and\nSeddighin [APPROX '23].

The combination of polarity and fluidity leads to complex\nphase behaviour, and rich new physics, yet the limited understanding around how\nspecific molecular features generate long-range polar ordering in a fluid is a\nhindrance to development of new materials. In this work, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that probes the bimolecular potential energy landscape\nof candidate molecules, enabling us to dissect the role of directional\nintermolecular interactions in establishing polar order. In closely related\nfamilies of materials we find conflicting preferences for (anti)parallel\nordering which can be accounted for by specific interactions between molecules.\nThus, our results allow us to argue that the presence (or absence) of polar\norder is a product of specific molecular features and strong directional\nintermolecular interactions rather than being simply a product of dipole-dipole\nforces.

Aims: This study explores\nhow the DEI backlash is unfolding in the software industry by investigating\ninstitutional changes, lived experiences, and the strategies used to sustain\nDEI practices. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 59 publicly\navailable Reddit posts authored by self-identified software professionals. Data\nwere analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Our findings show\nthat software companies are responding to the DEI backlash in varied ways,\nincluding re-structuring programs, scaling back investments, or quietly\ncontinuing efforts under new labels.

It is\nherein typically assumed that logical Clifford gates can be executed without\nnoise. Therefore, MSD is a standard subroutine to obtain a fault-tolerant\nuniversal set of quantum gate operations on error-corrected logical qubits.\nWell-known schemes conventionally rely on performing operator measurements and\npost-selection on the measurement result, which makes distillation protocols\nnon-deterministic in the presence of noise. In this work, we adapt the 15-to-1\nMSD protocol such that it deterministically suppresses noise by using a\ncoherent feedback network on the output states without the need to perform\nindividual qubit measurements. These advantages over textbook MSD come at the\nprice of reducing the noise suppression per round from $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(p^2)$.

In Hall thrusters, the\ncore factor influencing operational states is the electron cross field\ntransport, where the azimuthal instability serves as a key mechanism. The\nrotational flow of neutral gas may affect instability by altering initial\nazimuthal velocity of ions, which has not been investigated before. Therefore,\nto study the effects of ion rotational flow of varying magnitudes and\ndirections on azimuthal instability, simulations are conducted in this work\nbased on two benchmark particle-in-cell (PIC) cases: the azimuthal-axial and\nthe azimuthal-radial. The results indicate that the ion rotational flow\nvelocity can potentially complicate the coupling characteristics of the\nelectron cyclotron drifting instability and the modified two stream\ninstability, particularly when a reverse rotational flow velocity is added. In\ngeneral, both co-directional and reverse ion rotational flow have been observed\nto inhibit azimuthal instability, which results in a decrease in axial electron\nmobility. A 1% addition of the ion rotational flow (compared to the electron\ndrift) would result in a 10% change of the electron mobility due to varied\nazimuthal instability, and the decrease in electron mobility of the reverse ion\nrotational flow is greater than that of co-directional.

This\ndenoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods\nthat treated all training samples as equal.

However, many works discover that they struggle to capture\nimportant, high-level relationships that are present in the real world. For\nexample, they fail to learn physical laws from data, and even fail to\nunderstand that the objects in the world exist in a stable fashion. This is due\nto the fact that important conditional dependence structures are not adequately\ncaptured in the vanilla diffusion models. In this work, we initiate an in-depth\nstudy on strengthening the diffusion model to capture the conditional\ndependence structures in the data. In particular, we examine the efficacy of\nthe auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models for such purpose and develop the\nfirst theoretical results on the sampling error of AR diffusion models under\n(possibly) the mildest data assumption. Our theoretical findings indicate that,\ncompared with typical diffusion models, the AR variant produces samples with a\nreduced gap in approximating the data conditional distribution. On the other\nhand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately\nlarger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical\nfor large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that\nwhen there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR\ndiffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so.\nOn the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across\npatches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-30T04:57:12Z"}

Online platforms employ a range of\nRecSys techniques to personalize user experience across diverse in-app\nsurfaces. User representations are often learned individually through user's\nhistorical interactions within each surface and user representations across\ndifferent surfaces can be shared post-hoc as auxiliary features or additional\nretrieval sources. While effective, such schemes cannot directly encode\ncollaborative filtering signals across different surfaces, hindering its\ncapacity to discover complex relationships between user behaviors and\npreferences across the whole platform. To bridge this gap at Snapchat, we seek\nto conduct universal user modeling (UUM) across different in-app surfaces,\nlearning general-purpose user representations which encode behaviors across\nsurfaces.

While previous\nmethods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited\ninformation about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits\nas probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it\ncreates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot\nproperties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar\nvariability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map\nrepresentation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of\nStarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for\nspot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data\nexperiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar\norientation, and spot physical properties.

Removing the shape noise from\nthe observed WL field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by\naccessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without\ndenoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance\nof denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations,\nwhich serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000\nmaps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models\ncan fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we\nmeasure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point\nprobability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering\ntransform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all\nstatistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales within\nroughly $0.3 \\sigma$ level at the scales accessible from current and future WL\nsurveys. We also conduct the stress tests on the trained model; denoising the\nmaps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the\ndata used in training.

Particular attention is drawn at the robustness, efficiency\nand scalability of these variable projection second-order algorithms such that\nthey can be used also on larger datasets now commonly found in many practical\nproblems for which only first-order algorithms based on sequential repetitions\nof local optimization (e.g., majorization, Expectation-Maximization or\nalternating least-squares methods) or variations of gradient descent (e.g.,\nconjugate, proximal or stochastic gradient descent methods), or hybrid\nalgorithms from these two classes of methods, were only feasible due to their\nlower cost and memory requirement per iteration. In parallel with this review\nof variable projection algorithms, we develop new formulae for the Jacobian and\nHessian matrices involved in these variable projection methods and demonstrate\ntheir very specific properties such as the uniform rank deficiency of the\nJacobian matrix or the rank deficiency of the Hessian matrix at the (local)\nminimizers of the cost function associated with the WLRA problem.

With this motivation, the entropy-ruled charge dynamics method has\nbeen recently proposed, which unifies band and hopping transport mechanism via\nquantum-classical transition analogy. Here, the energy (in terms of chemical\npotential) scaled entropy has a direct proportion with the density of states\n(DOS); and hence it is termed as DOS proportion. This proportion principally\nacts as a key descriptor for charge transport calculations in both molecular\nand materials systems, which is directly connected with all CT quantities like\nmobility, conductivity, current density etc. This perspective explains a unique\nnature of entropy-ruled method for the entire transport range from delocalized\nband to localization (or hopping) transport. The validity and limitations of\nEinstein relation and Boltzmann approach are discussed with different limits\nand physical conditions for disordered molecules and periodic systems. Finally,\nthe futuristic scope and expected progress is addressed for correlated electron\ndynamical systems and devices.

While deep learning-based human pose\nestimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on\npublic datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often\nhindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose\nrepresentations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such\nchallenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still\nstruggles to generalize across diverse sports environments.

We focus on studies that calculated\nfriction or retrieval forces using in vitro models. We have also included\ncurrent trends, limitations, and future perspectives on studying and\nunderstanding frictional forces and their implementation into in silico models.\nFindings indicate that fibrin-rich clots are more difficult to retrieve than\nred blood cell (RBC)-rich clots due to their higher friction coefficient, three\nto four times greater, an observation supported by multiple studies. SR-vessel\nand SR-clot friction also influence MT effectiveness. SR-vessel interaction\nplays a crucial role in acutely curved vessels, as SR compression reduces its\nefficiency. In SR-clot interaction, RBC-rich clot fragmentation is linked to\nrelative interaction forces. In summary, obtaining in vivo frictional values\nremains challenging, and inconsistencies persist in past in vitro studies.\nFurther, a deeper understanding of frictional forces is essential for\noptimizing MT, improving current SRs, and developing next-generation\nthrombectomy technologies.","main_category":"physics.med-ph","categories":"physics.med-ph","published":"2025-05-06T15:31:09Z"}

For concatenated codes,\nwhere one code is embedded within another, optimal decoding can be achieved\nusing a message-passing algorithm that sends conditional error probabilities\nfrom the lower-level code to a higher-level decoder. In this work, we study the\nXYZ$^2$ topological stabilizer code, defined on a honeycomb lattice, and use\nthe fact that it can be viewed as a concatenation of a [[2, 1, 1]] phase-flip\nparity check code and the surface code with $YZZY$ stabilizers, to decode the\nsyndrome information in two steps. We use this sequential decoding scheme to\ncorrect errors on data qubits, as well as measurement errors, under various\nbiased error models using both a maximum-likelihood decoder (MLD) and more\nefficient matching-based decoders. For depolarizing noise we find that the\nsequential matching decoder gives a threshold of 18.3%, close to optimal, as a\nconsequence of a favorable, effectively biased, error model on the upper-level\nYZZY code. For phase-biased noise on data qubits, at a bias $\\eta =\n\\frac{p_z}{p_x+p_y} = 10$, we find that a belief-matching-based decoder reaches\nthresholds of 24.1%, compared to 28.6% for the MLD. With measurement errors the\nthresholds are reduced to 3.4% and 4.3%, for depolarizing and biased noise\nrespectively, using the belief-matching decoder. This demonstrates that the\nXYZ$^2$ code has thresholds that are competitive with other codes tailored to\nbiased noise. The results also showcase two approaches to taking advantage of\nconcatenated codes: 1) tailoring the upper-level code to the effective noise\nprofile of the decoded lower-level code, and 2) making use of an upper-level\ndecoder that can utilize the local information from the lower-level code.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-05-06T16:53:51Z"}

Strikingly, the recent introduction\nof higher-order topological insulators has generalized the fundamental\nframework of topological photonics, endowing counterintuitive strong\nconfinement of light at lower-dimensional boundaries, thus unlocking exciting\nprospects for the exploration of topological phenomena in fresh routes as well\nas the design of topology-driven nanoscale light sources. Here, we revealed the\nphotonic quadrupole topological phases can be activated by defect evolution and\nperformed experimental demonstrations of associated nanoscale lasing operation\nunder this paradigm. The quadrupole higher-order topological nanocavity is\nconstructed by two topologically distinct photonic crystal slabs with opposite\ndirections of defect evolution. Stable single mode emission and low lasing\nthreshold in telecom C-band are achieved at room temperature of the\ndefect-evolved quadrupole topological nanolaser. This work reveals new\npossibilities for photonic quadrupole topological phase transition, providing\nan intriguing route toward light confinement and modulation under the\ntopological framework.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-05-08T15:06:37Z"}

We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation,\nwhich obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external\nfield plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration\nof their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the\nvoltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite\nfrequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response\nof the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the\nGHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05377v1","title":"Salt-induced gelation of nonionic sucrose ester dispersions","summary":"The dispersions of nonionic sucrose ester surfactants in water exhibit a\nhighly negative zeta-potential, though its origin remains controversial. The\naddition of electrolytes to these dispersions may influence their\nzeta-potential, thus potentially affecting their physicochemical properties.\nThe electrolyte- and pH- driven gelation of aqueous dispersions of commercial\nsucrose stearate (S970) containing ca. 1:1 monoesters and diesters was studied\nusing optical microscopy, rheological and zeta-potential measurements, and\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering techniques. At low electrolyte concentrations and\npH $\\gtrapprox$ 5, 0.5-5 wt. % S970 dispersions exhibited low viscosities and\nbehaved as freely flowing liquids. The addition of electrolytes of low\nconcentrations, e.g. 9 mM NaCl or 1.5 mM MgCl$_2$, induced the formation of a\nnon-flowing gels. This sol-gel transition occurred due to the partial screening\nof the diesters particles charge, allowing the formation of an attractive gel\nnetwork, spanning across the dispersion volume. Complete charge screening,\nhowever, led to a gel-sol transition and phase separation. Gel formation was\nobserved also by pH variation without electrolyte addition, whereas the\naddition of free fatty acids had negligible impact on dispersion properties.\nThese findings support the hypothesis that the negative charge in sucrose ester\ndispersions arises from hydroxyl anions adsorption on particles surfaces. Gels\nwere formed using just 1.3 wt. % surfactant, and the critical electrolyte\nconcentration for gelation was found to scale approximately with the square of\nthe cation charge, in agreement with the low surface charge density theory. The\nbiodegradable sucrose esters gels offer a sustainable alternative for\nstructuring personal and home care products, replacing the wormlike micelles of\nsynthetic surfactants typically used at much higher surfactant and salt\nconcentrations.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-05-08T16:11:33Z"}

The simulated system closely\nfollows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime\nof agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly\noptimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing\nvaluable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more\ngenerally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing\nare primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.\nThese are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference\ngoal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The\nregime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical\ndamping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple\nstages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to\na diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between\nquasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and\nincoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales\nof space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the\nbest-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the\nresponding system and the fluctuating driver.

Model-driven data filtering\nhas increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.\nHowever, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data\nverification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data\nquality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks\nclear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of\nsubjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient\nverification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on\nLLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,\nwe build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM\ntraining, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize\nthe selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data\nfiltering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,\nclassifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental\nand inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we\nemploy a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the\nfiltering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese\nFineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb\ndataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120\nbillion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on\nUltra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple\nbenchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both\ndata quality and training efficiency.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-05-08T17:15:20Z"}

For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally\ninduced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type\nquadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the\nnumber of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling,\nthereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately\nand test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in\nnuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into\napproximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic\nrelativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution,\nthereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating\nstars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among\nvarious tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations --\nagree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate\nhow the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination\nof macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate\nthat the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar\ntidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism.\nOur findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be\nattributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies\non the possible origin of the universality.","main_category":"gr-qc","categories":"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,nucl-ex,nucl-th","published":"2025-05-08T17:19:11Z"}
