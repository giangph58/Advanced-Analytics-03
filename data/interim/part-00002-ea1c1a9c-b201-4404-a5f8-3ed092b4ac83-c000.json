However, existing\ncell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary\ndomain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources\n(i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance.\nAlthough incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often\nexacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts. In this work, we\nintroduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model\n(AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these\nobstacles through two key innovations. First, we propose a Conditional Gradient\nReversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features\nfrom diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while\npreserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset. Second, we\naddress SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution\nDecoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in\norder to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology\nimages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM\nfor multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation.\nWe validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating\nconsistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-03-27T16:59:39Z"}

We say that a series is commutative if the\nvalue in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input.\nThe commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite\npresentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it\nis commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has\nnot been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.\n  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that\nconstitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's\nvarieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series,\nintroduced by Sch\\\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective\n(pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.\n  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of\nformal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata,\nshuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these\nmodels recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their\ncommutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it\nremarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such\ndisparate computation models.\n  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of\nformal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power\nseries for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential\nequations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks\nto this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive\nsequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are\neffective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.","main_category":"cs.FL","categories":"cs.FL,cs.DM,cs.LO","published":"2025-03-27T17:01:19Z"}

Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature\nin the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected\nregions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the\ntime-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources\ncould be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two\nmethods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio\ninterferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nimaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct\nthree-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the\nvisibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by\ncross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed\nvisibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the\nvisibility equation in the near field. We also develop a full polarization\nsimulation framework for RFI and demonstrate the methods on simulated\nobservations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced\nby these algorithms are investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms\nare applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral,\nand temporal characterization of two local RFI sources.

However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum\ncomputers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum\ncircuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this\npaper, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1,860\npossible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with\nPRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success\nprobabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker\\r{a}.\nAs a result, we found that the success probability of Shor's algorithm for\nsolving the DLP exhibits periodicity with an asymmetric waveform determined by\nthe order $q$. Additionally, we generated 1,015 quantum circuits for larger\npairs of $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared\nthem for $p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in\nclassical cryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr\ngroups is the same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the\nstrength of the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when\nusing Shor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and\ntheoretically shown that when a ripple carry adder is used in the addition\ncircuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under\nShor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with\n$p=1024$ bits.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-03-31T10:39:10Z"}

Our results reveal that mm/cm-sized\ngrains are preferentially concentrated within the inner 5-10 au of the disk,\nwhere the dust-to-gas surface density ratio (local metalicity Z) significantly\nexceeds the canonical 0.01, reaching values up to 0.25. This enhancement arises\nfrom the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional\nplane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion\ndriven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous\nmeridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings.

We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in\nexoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to\ngenerate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that\nradio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active\nsolar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence\non the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the planetary field is\nnot too strong, the planetary magnetosphere is pushing against the CME,\nincreasing its density so the radio burst is visible at higher frequencies.\nWhen the planetary field is very strong, the large magnetosphere does not leave\nroom for the CME shock to evolve so the radio burst is more visible in the\nlower frequencies associated with the weak compression at the flanks of the CME\nshock. In case of highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar\nfields weakens the solar-like CME shock, thus generates very weak (almost\nnon-visible) radio burst signals.

This\npaper introduces two novel methods to strengthen the robustness of the kNN-VC\nframework for SVC. First, kNN-VC's core representation, WavLM, lacks harmonic\nemphasis, resulting in dull sounds and ringing artifacts. To address this, we\nleverage the bijection between WavLM, pitch contours, and spectrograms to\nperform additive synthesis, integrating the resulting waveform into the model\nto mitigate these issues. Second, kNN-VC overlooks concatenative smoothness, a\nkey perceptual factor in SVC. To enhance smoothness, we propose a new distance\nmetric that filters out unsuitable kNN candidates and optimize the summing\nweights of the candidates during inference. Although our techniques are built\non the kNN-VC framework for implementation convenience, they are broadly\napplicable to general concatenative neural synthesis models. Experimental\nresults validate the effectiveness of these modifications in achieving robust\nSVC.

In real-world situations, however, such\ndrops do not remain in isolation, as they interact with their neighboring\nentities, including other drops in proximity as well as a nearby solid\nboundary, setting up a complex interplay between the confinement-mediated\ninteractions and the three-dimensional nature of the droplet dynamics.

However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred\ndirectly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges\ntypically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP\nguarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.\n  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four\ndiscretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models.

At any location, the UAV observes i.i.d. data\nsequentially in discrete time instants. The distribution of the observation\ndata changes at some unknown, arbitrary time and the UAV has to detect this\nchange in the shortest possible time. Change can occur at most at one location\nover the entire infinite time horizon. The UAV switches between these two\nlocations in order to quickly detect the change. To this end, we propose\nLocation Switching and Change Detection (LS-CD) algorithm which uses a repeated\none-sided sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) based mechanism for\nobservation-driven location switching and change detection. The primary goal is\nto minimize the worst-case average detection delay (WADD) while meeting\nconstraints on the average run length to false alarm (ARL2FA) and the UAV's\ntime-averaged energy consumption.

We identified peaks\nthrough a well tested algorithm and selected GRBs with at least 10 peaks out of\n5 GRB catalogues (Swift/BAT, CGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM, Insight-HXMT,\nBeppoSAX/GRBM). Each GRB was simply treated as a discrete point process, whose\nrealisation coincides with the sequence of peak times.

Such is\nthe plasmon excitation or pumping mechanism which, although indirect, is very\nefficient and hence may give rise to formation of plasmonic coherent states. In\nturn, these states may act as a source or sink of energy and momentum for\nescaping electrons. Starting from the model Hamiltonian approach we show that\nprepumped plasmonic bath of coherent states gives rise to ponderomotive\npotentials and Floquet electronic band structure that support multiple\nplasmon-induced electron emission or plasmoemission from metals. Theoretical\ndescription of multiple plasmoemission requires a nonperturbative approch which\nis here formulated by applying cumulant expansion and Volkov ansatz to the\ncalculations of electron wavefunctions and emission rates.

Improving IMPT delivery efficiency reduces motion-related\nuncertainties, enhances plan robustness, and benefits breath-hold techniques by\nshortening treatment time. Among various factors, energy switching time plays a\ncritical role, making energy layer optimization (ELO) essential. This work\ndevelops an energy layer optimization method based on mixed integer model and\nvariational quantum computing algorithm to enhance the efficiency of IMPT. The\nenergy layer optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, where\ncontinuous variables optimize the dose distribution and binary variables\nindicate energy layer selection. To solve it, iterative convex relaxation\ndecouples the dose-volume constraints, followed by the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) to separate mixed-variable optimization and the\nminimum monitor unit (MMU) constraint.

On\nthe basis of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric, this solution realizes a\nlong-range confinement correction by introducing the NED parameter $\\zeta$,\nproviding a new theoretical perspective for explaining the anomalies in galaxy\nrotation curves. To deeply explore the dynamic properties of this black hole\nsolution, this paper combines two complementary methods, namely, time-domain\nevolution and the WKB approximation, to calculate the quasinormal mode (QNM)\nspectrum of its scalar field perturbations. The research results show that the\noscillation frequencies and decay rates of the low-order QNM modes decrease\nmonotonically with the increase of the NED parameter $\\zeta$, and exhibit an\napproximately linear dependence. The analysis of the greybody factor (GF)\nindicates that as $\\zeta$ increases, the transmittance of the low-frequency\nscalar field also increases. The enhanced long-range confinement effect caused\nby the increase of $\\zeta$ makes low-frequency perturbations more likely to\nsurvive and propagate in space-time on the one hand, and at the same time\nenhances the transmission ability of the low-frequency scalar field.

The\ndevelopment of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces\nchallenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex\nenvironmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task\nbalanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN).

Traditional diffusion-based\nmethods struggle to extrapolate to unseen physical conditions (eg, velocity)\ndue to their reliance on data-driven approximations. To address this, we\npropose to integrate symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to enforce\nphysical consistency in video generation. We first introduce the Diffusion\nTimestep Tokenizer (DDT), which learns discrete, recursive visual tokens by\nrecovering visual attributes lost during the diffusion process. The recursive\nvisual tokens enable symbolic reasoning by a large language model. Based on it,\nwe propose the Phys-AR framework, which consists of two stages: The first stage\nuses supervised fine-tuning to transfer symbolic knowledge, while the second\nstage applies reinforcement learning to optimize the model's reasoning\nabilities through reward functions based on physical conditions.

An industrial case study reported\nthat developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly\ncost of $2,250. We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with\nco-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic\nflakiness. This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing\nshared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather\nthan tackling them individually. This study represents an inflection point by\nchallenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated\noccurrences. We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24\nJava projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job\nscheduling.

In line with the current trends in topological graph theory and its\napplications in mathematical physics, graphs are considered in the most relaxed\nform and as such they may contain multiple edges, loops and semi-edges.\n  Nevertheless, simple graphs (binary structures without multiple edges, loops,\nor semi-edges) play an important role.

To leverage this, Ascendra\npartitions GPU resources into two types of instances: low-priority and\nhigh-priority.

To align with legacy wireless\napplications, such as enhanced mobile broadband or ultra-reliable low-latency\ncommunication, network slicing has been widely adopted. However, attempting to\nstatistically isolate the above types of wireless applications through\ndifferent network slices may lead to throughput degradation and increased queue\nbacklog. To address these challenges, we establish a unified QoS-aware\nframework that supports immersive communication and legacy wireless\napplications simultaneously. Based on the Lyapunov drift theorem, we transform\nthe original long-term throughput maximization problem into an equivalent\nshort-term throughput maximization weighted by virtual queue length. Moreover,\nto cope with the challenges introduced by the interaction between\nlarge-timescale network slicing and short-timescale resource allocation, we\npropose an adaptive adversarial slicing (Ad2S) scheme for networks with\ninvarying channel statistics. To track the network channel variations, we also\npropose a measurement extrapolation-Kalman filter (ME-KF)-based method and\nrefine our scheme into Ad2S-non-stationary refinement (Ad2S-NR).

Recognizing this limitation, XAI\nhas emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the\noutput of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.\nThese methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the\nreliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter\nintroduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based\napproaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their\nintegration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting\nbehaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use\nof Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale\ngeographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on\nthe challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new\ndirections.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,econ.EM","published":"2025-05-01T15:25:23Z"}

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose\nreinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting\ntoken-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating\nposition IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on\nsuperficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our\nwork illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role\nbehavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI,I.2","published":"2025-05-01T16:06:16Z"}

We propose RCMed, a\nfull-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and\noutput, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and\nreliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A\nself-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform\nlanguage context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming\na closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a\ncolor region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into\nsemantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across\nscales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves\nstate-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle\nanatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities.

We perform experiments on real world data to showcase our\nalgorithm. It is seen that the model outperforms traditional machine learning\napproaches such as decision tree and support vector machine, and for small\ndatasets it outperforms other deep learning models.

The\nmethod operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the\nanomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected\npredictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to\npre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an\navoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the\nsignal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and\ndisturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle.\nTherefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation\nby an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and\nnormal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at\na distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect\nroad surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard\nconsumer hardware.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-07T13:17:05Z"}

Since\nthen, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and\ninstruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable.\nWhile HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST\nNIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity\nwith highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD\n209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a\nnewly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium\nchemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model\nwith free retrievals ($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and\nC/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals\n($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar\nvalues using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O\nand CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with\nSTIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam\nobservations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and\nC/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model\nchoice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry\nretrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar\nconstraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone\ncan lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and,\ntherefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared\nobservations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity.\nSpecifically, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we\ncannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM","published":"2025-05-07T13:47:49Z"}

As a consequence, item ID\nembeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the\nconvergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational\ncontent inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel\nmodel (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these\nfeatures to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features\nderived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of\nitems, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with\nmodality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities.\nMoreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a\nprogressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec.

In numerical models of Earth's core\ndynamics, reversals occur with increasing frequency when the convective forcing\nis increased past a critical level. This transition has previously been related\nto the influence of inertia in the force balance. Because this force is\nsubdominant in Earth's core, concerns have been raised regarding the\ngeophysical applicability of this paradigm. Reproducing the reversal rate of\nthe past million years also requires forcing conditions that do not guarantee\nthat the rest of the geomagnetic variation spectrum is reproduced. These issues\nmotivate the search for alternative reversal mechanisms. Using a suite of\nnumerical models where buoyancy is provided at the bottom of the core by\ninner-core freezing, we show that the magnetic dipole amplitude is controlled\nby the relative strength of subsurface upwellings and horizontal circulation at\nthe core surface. A relative weakening of upwellings brings the system from a\nstable to a reversing dipole state. This mechanism is purely kinematic because\nit operates irrespectively of the interior force balance. It is therefore\nexpected to apply at the physical conditions of Earth's core. Subsurface\nupwellings may be impeded by stable stratification in the outermost core. We\nshow that with weak stratification levels corresponding to a nearly adiabatic\ncore surface heat flow, a single model reproduces the observed geomagnetic\nvariations ranging from decades to millions of years. \\rev{In contrast with}\nthe existing paradigm, reversals caused by this stable top core mechanism\nbecome more frequent when the level of stratification increases i.e. when the\ncore heat flow decreases. This suggests that the link between mantle dynamics\nand magnetic reversal frequency needs to be reexamined.","main_category":"physics.geo-ph","categories":"physics.geo-ph","published":"2025-05-08T13:12:37Z"}
