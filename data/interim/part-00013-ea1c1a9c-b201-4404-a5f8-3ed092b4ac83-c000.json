However, processing a large number of visual\ntokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational\noverhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits\nincreasing performance advantages over existing approaches.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-03-31T11:13:18Z"}

Execution on computing accelerators (XPUs) like graphic\nprocessing units (GPUs) can greatly reduce this cost. However, established\nthermochemistry software is not readily portable to such devices or sacrifices\nvaluable analytical forms that enable differentiation for sensitivity analysis\nand implicit time integration. Symbolic abstractions are developed with\ncorresponding transformations that enable computation on accelerators and\nautomatic differentiation by avoiding premature specification of detail. The\nsoftware package Pyrometheus is introduced as an implementation of these\nabstractions and their transformations for combustion thermochemistry. The\nformulation facilitates code generation from the symbolic representation of a\nspecific thermochemical mechanism in multiple target languages, including\nPython, C++, and Fortran. Computational concerns are separated: the generated\ncode processes array-valued expressions but does not specify their semantics.\nThese semantics are provided by compatible array libraries, such as NumPy,\nPytato, and Google JAX. Thus, the generated code retains a symbolic\nrepresentation of the thermochemistry, which translates to computation on\naccelerators and CPUs and automatic differentiation. The design and operation\nof these symbolic abstractions and their companion tool, Pyrometheus, are\ndiscussed throughout.

In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system\nacts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without\npremium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for\nsoybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat).

They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from\npre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising\navenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress,\nthese methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the\ngeometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D\nGaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper,\nwe propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian\nReconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from\nsingle-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can\nsimultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose\na novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation\ncontains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity\nfrom 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the\noptimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is\nobtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal\nfeatures, both of which can be estimated from 2D images.

Image quality assessment is often applied\nwith full-reference methods to estimate the similarity between the ground truth\nand the output images. However, current methods often show poor agreement with\nvisual perception and lead to the generation of various full-reference metrics\ntailored to specific applications. Additionally, they rely on pixel-wise\ncomparisons, emphasizing local intensity similarity while often overlooking\ncomprehensive and interpretable image quality assessment. To address these\nissues, we have developed a multi-marker similarity method that compares\nstandard quality markers, such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast,\nand high frequency components. The method computes a similarity score between\nthe image and the ground truth for each marker, then combines these scores into\nan overall similarity estimate.

Multi-marker similarity provides a reliable and\ninterpretable method for image quality assessment and the generation of quality\nrankings.

However, the conventional phased array\nused in VSM is vulnerable to privacy breaches, as an eavesdropper can extract\nsensitive vital sign information by analyzing the reflected radar signals. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy in radar-based VSM\nby modifying the radar transmitter hardware, specifically by strategically\nselecting the transmit antennas from the available antennas in the transmit\narray. By dynamically selecting which antennas connect or disconnect to the\nradio frequency chain, the transmitter introduces additional phase noise to the\nradar echoes, generating false frequencies in the power spectrum of the\nextracted phases at the eavesdropper's receiver. The antenna activation pattern\nis designed to maximize the variance of the phases introduced by antenna\nselection, which effectively makes the false frequencies dominate the spectrum,\nobscuring the actual vital sign frequencies. Meanwhile, the authorized\nreceiver, having knowledge of the antenna selection pattern, can compensate for\nthe phase noise and accurately extract the vital signs. Numerical experiments\nare conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\nenhancing privacy while maintaining vital sign monitoring.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-02T15:28:07Z"}

In the classic case of recommending\nmovies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like\nand don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the\nevaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training\ndata. This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to\nrecommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the\nsame task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched\nthem. This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to\navoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each\nmovie. As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the\nMovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. Our primary\nobjective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching,\ni.e. predict their watchlist. To construct this extension, we recruited\nMovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse\nset of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the\npools. Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of\nevaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total\nnumber of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation\nruns we used to build the pools. In contrast, when we rank the runs by users'\ninterest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a\nrecommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs. It appears\nthat by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate\nthe popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness\nmeasures for the evaluation of recommender systems.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-02T16:15:46Z"}

(2024a) computed the\nLMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that\nthe LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly\ncounter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of\n$\\Omega_p = -1.0 \\pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar\npattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal\nfinite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results:\nIn the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like\ngalaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that\nsuffers a slowdown from $\\Omega_p \\sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\\Omega_p \\sim 0$\nkm/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\\Omega_p \\sim\n3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before\ninteraction) pattern speed of $\\Omega_p \\sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the\nK21 simulation are comparable.

Here, we investigate interacting\nbehaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to behaviours around\ntesting and isolation. This epidemiological-behavioural interaction is of\nparticular interest as, prospectively, it is well-placed to be informed by\nreal-world data temporally monitoring test results and compliance with testing\npolicy. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing \"behaviour and\ndisease\" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and\nisolation.

We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to\ninform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model\nparameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. As the presented\ninterdisciplinary modelling approach can accommodate further extensions\n(including, but not limited to, adding testing capacity, decay in behavioural\neffects and multiple pathogen variants), we hope that our work will encourage\nfurther modelling studies integrating specific measured behaviours and disease\ndynamics that may reduce the health and economic impacts of future epidemics.","main_category":"q-bio.PE","categories":"q-bio.PE,physics.soc-ph","published":"2025-04-03T11:10:08Z"}

To address this\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\nglobal path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is\ndesigned with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations\nthat occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the\nrobot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates\nthat the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning\nability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the\ncollaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-03T11:15:10Z"}

In this paper, the above two aspects are considered,\nand an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering\n(IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is\nfully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples\nare grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors\nof all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the\nclusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making\nprocess of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices\nare introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by\ncapturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different\nstyles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data\nrepresentation capability. After determining the antecedents of all the fuzzy\nrules, the optimization problem of IS-TSK-FC can be iteratively solved in an\nalternation manner. The effectiveness of IS-TSK-FC as an interpretable\nclustering tool is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets with unknown implicit/explicit styles. Specially, the superior\nclustering performance of IS-TSK-FC is demonstrated on case studies where\ndifferent groups of data present explicit styles.

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle\nmultiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential.\nHowever, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather\nconditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world\ndegradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with\ndegradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed\nDA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive\ndegradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration.\nSpecifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware\nrepresentations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space.\nBy aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each\nprompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The\nlearned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed\nweather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple\nweather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather\ndegradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a\ndynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of\nrestoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion\nmodel to restore diverse degradations adaptively. Experimental results\nsubstantiate the favorable performance of DA2Diff over state-of-the-arts in\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task\nidentification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks.

Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could\nbe made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this\nwork, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low\nmodel competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures\nconfidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate\nhigh-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD),\nFeature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent\nGradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these\nmethods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for\nlow model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising\nmethods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three\nmethods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nto generate language explanations for low model competency.

However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges,\nparticularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process\nlarge volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these\nlimitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V\nspectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an\nautoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly\ndetection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within\nspectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May\n5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly\ncomplex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in\nmagnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy\nstorage and possible triggers for flares.

However, the observational challenges to obtain stellar F abundances\nfavor samples with higher metallicities, resulting in a scarcity of\nmeasurements at low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $<-2.0$). We present F abundances and\nupper limits in 7 carbon enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars observed with the\nImmersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS), at the Gemini-South\ntelescope. These new observations delivered high-resolution, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, infrared spectra allowing us to probe significantly\ndeeper into the metal-poor regime and the cosmic origin of F. This work\npresents the results of our observations, including two 2-sigma detections and\nfive upper limits in a variety of CEMP stars.

The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high\nmomentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and\nspin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a\nlinear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits\nspin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and\nnext-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other\nruthenate trimers in this series.

While there has been\nadvances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they\nonly provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still\nindispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can\ncreate a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models\nwith automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global\nmodels can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning.\nWe formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the\nmerging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server\nbroadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs\nto send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of\nperiodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global\nmodel, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data\ndistribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds\ncaused by client drift.

It regulates concurrent access to database data by following a\nspecific sequence of acquiring and releasing locks during transaction\nexecution, thereby ensuring transaction isolation. However, in strict 2PL,\ntransactions must wait for conflicting transactions to commit and release their\nlocks, which reduces concurrency and system throughput. We have observed this\nissue is exacerbated in high-contented workloads at Tencent, where lock\ncontention can severely degrade system performance. While existing\noptimizations demonstrate some effectiveness in high-contention scenarios,\ntheir performance remains insufficient, as they suffer from lock contention and\nwaiting in hotspot access.\n  This paper presents optimizations in lock management implemented in Tencent's\ndatabase, TXSQL, with a particular focus on high-contention scenarios. First,\nwe discuss our motivations and the journey toward general lock optimization,\nwhich includes lightweight lock management, a copy-free active transaction\nlist, and queue locking mechanisms that effectively enhance concurrency.\nSecond, we introduce a hotspot-aware approach that enables certain highly\nconflicting transactions to switch to a group locking method, which groups\nconflicting transactions at a specific hotspot, allowing them to execute\nserially in an uncommitted state within a conflict group without the need for\nlocking, thereby reducing lock contention.

A\ncritical aspect of bittide's stability and performance is ensuring that these\nelastic buffers operate around a desired equilibrium point, preventing data\nloss due to overflow or underflow. This paper introduces a novel method for\ncentering buffer occupancies in a bittide network using a technique we term\nframe rotation. We propose a control strategy utilizing a directed spanning\ntree of the network graph. By adjusting the frequencies of nodes in a specific\norder dictated by this tree, and employing a pulsed feedback controller that\ntargets the buffer occupancy of edges within the spanning tree, we prove that\nall elastic buffers in the network can be driven to their desired equilibrium.\nThis ordered adjustment approach ensures that prior centering efforts are not\ndisrupted, providing a robust mechanism for managing buffer occupancy in\nbittide synchronized systems.","main_category":"cs.DC","categories":"cs.DC","published":"2025-04-09T17:02:27Z"}

To solve this problem, State Space Models, notably Mamba, is\nintroduced to efficiently model long-range dependencies in images with linear\ncomputational complexity. Relying on the Mamba and the fact that low-resolution\nimages rely on global information to compensate for missing details, while\nhigh-resolution reference images need to provide more local details for\naccurate super-resolution, we propose a global and local Mamba network\n(GLMamba) for multi-modality medical image super-resolution. To be specific,\nour GLMamba is a two-branch network equipped with a global Mamba branch and a\nlocal Mamba branch. The global Mamba branch captures long-range relationships\nin low-resolution inputs, and the local Mamba branch focuses more on\nshort-range details in high-resolution reference images. We also use the deform\nblock to adaptively extract features of both branches to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. A modulator is designed to further enhance deformable\nfeatures in both global and local Mamba blocks. To fully integrate the\nreference image for low-resolution image super-resolution, we further develop a\nmulti-modality feature fusion block to adaptively fuse features by considering\nsimilarities, differences, and complementary aspects between modalities. In\naddition, a contrastive edge loss (CELoss) is developed for sufficient\nenhancement of edge textures and contrast in medical images.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-14T11:14:24Z"}

While recent\nmethods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on\ngeometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from\nthe point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation\nfor 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images,\nleading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for\nestimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method\ncombines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified\nnetwork to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets,\nand NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted\nclass based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part.\nFinally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to\nrecover its final pose and size.

While various numerical methods\nhave been developed to simulate these behaviors, many conventional approaches\nstruggle to simultaneously capture geometric and material nonlinearities, as\nwell as nonlinear external interactions, particularly in highly deformable and\ndynamically evolving systems. The Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) method\nhas emerged as a robust and efficient numerical framework that intrinsically\npreserves geometric properties, accommodates material nonlinearity, and\naccurately models interactions with external environments and fields.

This tutorial\nprovides a systematic introduction to the DDG method for simulating nonlinear\nbehaviors in flexible structures.

While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected\nto prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An\nexplicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model\ndemonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum\nanomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band\ninsulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails\nto capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective\nfractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and\nan emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band\nstructure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is\nforbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and\nwe argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase\napproximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we\ncharacterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we\ndeduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect\nof doping, temperature and an external magnetic field.

Since\nworkers are typically unwilling to provide training services/models freely and\nvoluntarily, many incentive mechanisms in FL are designed to incentivize\nparticipation by offering monetary rewards from requesters. However, existing\nstudies neglect two crucial aspects of real-world FL scenarios. First, workers\ncan possess inherent incompatibility characteristics (e.g., communication\nchannels and data sources), which can lead to degradation of FL efficiency\n(e.g., low communication efficiency and poor model generalization). Second, the\nrequesters are budgeted, which limits the amount of workers they can hire for\ntheir tasks.

Using a one-zone jet model, we fit the multi-wavelength spectral\nenergy distribution of the source, incorporating both leptonic and hadronic\ncascade emission from photohadronic interactions.

Self-supervised representation learning methods\nsuch as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very\nsuccessful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image\ndata, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for\ndownstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance\nas they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to\nimplement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the\nstrength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called\nthe Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we\nconvert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise\ncomparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information\nformulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse. We call our new\nobjective the Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss. We test MINC by\nlearning image representations on ImageNet (similar to SimCLR and BYOL) and\nshow that it consistently improves upon the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-23T12:35:27Z"}

Operating in such settings presents many\nchallenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth\nfuture paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at\nany moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions.\n  Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve\nthe necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee\ncollision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint\nmethods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation\ntimes.\n  To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS\nGlobal Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in\nspatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D\nenvironment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of\nexploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when\npotential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the\nFast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination\napproach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by\npre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still\nensuring collision-free trajectories.\n  We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests,\nconfined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments.

The main contribution is\npresenting a closed-form expression for the estimated conditional density ratio\nfunction with good finite-sample performance. The key idea is exploiting the\nlinear sieve combined with the quadratic norm. Matsushita et al. (2022)\nexploited the linear sieve to estimate the unconditional density ratio. We must\nexploit the linear sieve twice to estimate the conditional density ratio.\nFirst, we estimate an unconditional density ratio with an unweighted sieve\nleast-squares regression, as done in Matsushita et al. (2022), and then the\nconditional density ratio with a weighted sieve least-squares regression, where\nthe weights are the estimated unconditional density ratio. The proposed test\nhas several advantages over existing alternatives. First, the test statistic is\ninvariant to the monotone transformation of the data distribution and has a\nclosed-form expression that enhances computational speed and efficiency.\nSecond, the conditional density ratio satisfies the moment restrictions. The\nestimated ratio satisfies the empirical analog of those moment restrictions. As\na result, the estimated density ratio is unlikely to have extreme values.\nThird, the proposed test can detect all deviations from conditional\nindependence at rates arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/2}$ , and the local power\nloss is independent of the data dimension. A small-scale simulation study\nindicates that the proposed test outperforms the alternatives in various\ndependence structures.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME","published":"2025-04-24T07:23:29Z"}

The recent emergence of\nthe segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS\nbut cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due\nto its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational\ncost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust\nrepresentation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot\n3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM\nencoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage\nknowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between\nnatural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight\nencoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to\nupdate the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific\nencoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to\nperform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an\nauto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from\nthe general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model\nin boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted\non three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed\nRRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both\nsegmentation and registration tasks.

The 351.3-s white-dwarf spin\npulse was detected in X-rays, and the observable X-ray flux from the column\ndrastically decreased at the off-pulse phase, which suggests that the\nabsorption of the column by the accreting gas called the curtain was the major\ncause of the pulse.

Approximate modeling of\nneutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions\nfor these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of\nneutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\\nu$ for the\nnumber of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing\nneutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\\nu)$. Recent simulations\nfocused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve\nneutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\\nu$ over momentum space, preventing\ndirect calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an\nattractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos.\nTheir current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\\nu$: in our\nmost recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst\ncases, estimates of $f_\\nu$ to jump from $f_\\nu=0$ to $f_\\nu\\sim 10^5$.

In particular,\nthe spontaneous polarization has been reported to either point up or down for\nthe same unit cell orientation, depending on the literature source - with\nimportant implications for, e.g., the carrier type and density expected at\ninterfaces of heterostructures involving materials with wurtzite-structure.\nThis perspective aims to resolve this ambiguity by reviewing available reports\non the direction of the energetically preferred polarization direction in the\npresence of external electric fields, as well as atomically resolved scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy images. While we use ferroelectric wurtzite\nAlScN as a key example, our conclusions are generalizable to other compounds\nwith the same crystal structure.

Most of the\nprevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging\nmeta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However,\ndue to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture\nhigh-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance.\nAdditionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message\npassing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the\nefficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes\nMGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural\nNetwork for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two\nkey innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based\nheterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic\ninformation in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a\nmulti-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge\nlevels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions\namong nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while\npreserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As\nsuch, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates\nmore expressive node representations.

In\nfibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre\nof a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05441v1","title":"GesPrompt: Leveraging Co-Speech Gestures to Augment LLM-Based\n  Interaction in Virtual Reality","summary":"Large Language Model (LLM)-based copilots have shown great potential in\nExtended Reality (XR) applications. However, the user faces challenges when\ndescribing the 3D environments to the copilots due to the complexity of\nconveying spatial-temporal information through text or speech alone. To address\nthis, we introduce GesPrompt, a multimodal XR interface that combines co-speech\ngestures with speech, allowing end-users to communicate more naturally and\naccurately with LLM-based copilots in XR environments. By incorporating\ngestures, GesPrompt extracts spatial-temporal reference from co-speech\ngestures, reducing the need for precise textual prompts and minimizing\ncognitive load for end-users. Our contributions include (1) a workflow to\nintegrate gesture and speech input in the XR environment, (2) a prototype VR\nsystem that implements the workflow, and (3) a user study demonstrating its\neffectiveness in improving user communication in VR environments.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC","published":"2025-05-08T17:31:28Z"}

First, we characterize the laws\non these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting\ninvariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a\ncomprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps,\nsatisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to\nthose obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated\nmetric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length\nintervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on\nthe edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the\nBoltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that\nhalt exploration mid-edge.","main_category":"math.PR","categories":"math.PR,math-ph,math.CO,math.MP","published":"2025-05-08T17:37:43Z"}

We first find the stress-energy tensor using\nrelativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless\nbosons.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05465v1","title":"ComPO: Preference Alignment via Comparison Oracles","summary":"Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language\nmodels (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the\nissues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the\nnoisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and\ndispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we\npropose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and\nprovide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our\nmethod using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the\nflexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance\nof LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple\nbase and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with\nbenchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show\nthe effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations\nof existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we\nevidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs\nwith distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in\n\\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-05-08T17:56:57Z"}
