While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.

This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has\nnot been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.\n  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that\nconstitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's\nvarieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series,\nintroduced by Sch\\\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective\n(pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.\n  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of\nformal series generalising the rational ones.

Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature\nin the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected\nregions.

These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct\nthree-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the\nvisibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by\ncross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed\nvisibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the\nvisibility equation in the near field.

Interfaces\nare known to mediate the formation of hot spots that control their safety and\ninitiation. To study such processes at molecular scales, we developed all-atom\nforce fields (FFs) for Octol, a prototypical HE formulation comprised of TNT\n(2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and HMX\n(octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine). We extended a FF for TNT\nand recasted it in a form that can be readily combined with a well-established\nFF for HMX. The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental\nresults and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined\nTNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate\nthat there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in\nTNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural\nenvironments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal\nloading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are\neffective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that\nTNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond\ntimescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with\nsurface and interface energy. The modeling framework presented here will enable\nfuture studies on hot spot formation processes in accident scenarios that are\ngoverned by strong coupling between microstructural interfaces, material\nmechanics, momentum and energy transport, phase transitions, and chemistry.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-03-31T03:01:34Z"}

The complexity of natural samples plus the\nunspecificity of their treatments to isolate polymers renders the\ncharacterization of thousands of particles impractical for environmental\nmonitoring using conventional spectroscopic techniques.

To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2\nwhich integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global\nimage and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates\nthe pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter\n(MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the\nHierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement\nModule (DRM).

Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and\nglobal context by aggregating multi-view features within and across\nmulti-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored\nhigh-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained\ndetails resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong\ngeneralization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution\ndatasets.

To overcome\nthis issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm\nwith a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference\ntrajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target\nreference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning\nalgorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus\nimplicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is\nassessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype\nvehicle.

We used the most recent data obtained with the Yebes 40m telescope\nin the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz) in the frame of the QUIJOTE project.

To address this, we propose HumanDreamer, a\ndecoupled human video generation framework that first generates diverse poses\nfrom text prompts and then leverages these poses to generate human-motion\nvideos. Specifically, we propose MotionVid, the largest dataset for\nhuman-motion pose generation. Based on the dataset, we present MotionDiT, which\nis trained to generate structured human-motion poses from text prompts.\nBesides, a novel LAMA loss is introduced, which together contribute to a\nsignificant improvement in FID by 62.4%, along with respective enhancements in\nR-precision for top1, top2, and top3 by 41.8%, 26.3%, and 18.3%, thereby\nadvancing both the Text-to-Pose control accuracy and FID metrics. Our\nexperiments across various Pose-to-Video baselines demonstrate that the poses\ngenerated by our method can produce diverse and high-quality human-motion\nvideos. Furthermore, our model can facilitate other downstream tasks, such as\npose sequence prediction and 2D-3D motion lifting.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-03-31T12:51:45Z"}

We consider the geometry described by the classical\nsolutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the\nmatrix size is infinite. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric\nobjects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of any\nLie-Poisson algebra (linear Poisson algebra) on the algebraic variety defined\nby its Casimir polynomials. The Lie algebra that gives weak matrix\nregularization is not necessarily semisimple. Casimir polynomials correspond\nwith Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization.

Each\niteration involves solving a linear system involving a linear operator and its\nadjoint. However, in practical applications it is often computationally\nfavorable to replace the adjoint operator by a computationally more efficient\napproximation. This leads to an adjoint mismatch. In this paper, we analyze the\nconvergence of the primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method under the presence of an\nadjoint mismatch. We provide mild conditions that guarantee the existence of a\nfixed point and find an upper bound on the error of the primal solution.\nFurthermore, we establish step sizes in the strongly convex setting that\nguarantee linear convergence under mild conditions. Additionally, we provide an\nalternative method that can also be derived from the Douglas-Rachford method\nand is also guaranteed to converge in this setting. Moreover, we illustrate our\nresults both for an academic and a real-world inspired example.","main_category":"math.OC","categories":"math.OC","published":"2025-03-31T14:25:59Z"}

Our results reveal that mm/cm-sized\ngrains are preferentially concentrated within the inner 5-10 au of the disk,\nwhere the dust-to-gas surface density ratio (local metalicity Z) significantly\nexceeds the canonical 0.01, reaching values up to 0.25. This enhancement arises\nfrom the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional\nplane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion\ndriven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous\nmeridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings. The resulting\nsize-dependent dust distribution has a strong spatial variation, with large\ngrains preferentially accumulating in dense rings, particularly in the inner\ndisk, while being depleted in low-density gas gaps. In 3D, these rings and gaps\nare unstable to Rossby wave instability (RWI), generating arc-shaped vortices\nthat stand out more prominently than their gas counterparts in the inner disk\nbecause of preferential dust concentration at small radii. The substantial\nlocal enhancement of the dust relative to the gas could promote planetesimal\nformation via streaming instability, potentially aided by the \"azimuthal drift\"\nstreaming instability (AdSI) that operates efficiently in accreting disks and a\nlower Toomre Q expected in younger disks.

Therefore, they need to\nconstantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A\nparticular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers\ncontinuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods\nneed constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby\nlimiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning\nmethods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML)\npractices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining\nprior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is\nstill scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual\ngraph learning approaches for AML applications.

These networks are\nmodeled using temporal graphs, in which each edge is labeled with a time\nindicating its existence at a specific point in time. The time-varying network\nreliability is defined as the probability that a data packet from the source\nvertex can reach the terminal vertex, following links with increasing time\nlabels (i.e., a journey), while taking into account the possibility of network\nlink failures. Currently, the existing method for calculating this reliability\ninvolves explicitly enumerating all possible journeys between the source and\nterminal vertices and then calculating the reliability using the sum of\ndisjoint products method. However, this method has high computational\ncomplexity. In contrast, there is an efficient algorithm that uses binary\ndecision diagrams (BDDs) to evaluate the reliability of a network whose\ntopology does not change over time.

Foundation models (FM) have\ndemonstrated remarkable potential in both visual and language domains,\nachieving impressive generalization capabilities even with minimal data through\nfew-shot or zero-shot learning. However, translating these advances to FD\npresents unique hurdles.

To address this challenge,\nsemi-supervised learning is a well-established approach that leverages both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised\nteacher-student framework for biomedical image segmentation, inspired by the\nrecent success of generative models. Our approach leverages denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate segmentation masks by progressively\nrefining noisy inputs conditioned on the corresponding images. The teacher\nmodel is first trained in an unsupervised manner using a cycle-consistency\nconstraint based on noise-corrupted image reconstruction, enabling it to\ngenerate informative semantic masks. Subsequently, the teacher is integrated\ninto a co-training process with a twin-student network.

Intentional exploitation of these biases risks conveying\nmisleading information to the public. Current research on bias primarily\naddresses explicit biases with recognizable visual patterns, such as skin color\nand gender. This paper introduces a novel form of implicit bias that lacks\nexplicit visual features but can manifest in diverse ways across various\nsemantic contexts. This subtle and versatile nature makes this bias challenging\nto detect, easy to propagate, and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. We\nfurther propose an implicit bias injection attack framework (IBI-Attacks)\nagainst T2I diffusion models by precomputing a general bias direction in the\nprompt embedding space and adaptively adjusting it based on different inputs.\nOur attack module can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion\nmodels in a plug-and-play manner without direct manipulation of user input or\nmodel retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our\nscheme in introducing bias through subtle and diverse modifications while\npreserving the original semantics.

For instance, fake news detection\nmethods that rely on full text can be computationally inefficient, demand large\namounts of training data to achieve competitive accuracy, and may lack\nrobustness across different datasets.

While the prevailing practice of\ndiscriminative linear classifier has been tailored to domain-invariant\nfeatures, it struggles when confronted with diverse domain-specific\ninformation, e.g., intra-class shifts, that exhibits multi-modality.

Drawing from these insights, we propose\nGenerative Classifier-driven Domain Generalization (GCDG), introducing a\ngenerative paradigm for the DG classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) for each class across domains.

Building\non this insight, we propose DiffMSS, a novel marine saliency segmenter based on\nthe diffusion model, which utilizes semantic knowledge distillation to guide\nthe segmentation of marine salient objects. Specifically, we design a\nregion-word similarity matching mechanism to identify salient terms at the word\nlevel from the text descriptions. These high-level semantic features guide the\nconditional feature learning network in generating salient and accurate\ndiffusion conditions with semantic knowledge distillation. To further refine\nthe segmentation of fine-grained structures in unique marine organisms, we\ndevelop the dedicated consensus deterministic sampling to suppress\noverconfident missegmentations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of DiffMSS over state-of-the-art methods in both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-03T08:31:36Z"}

We present\nspatiotemporal characteristics of QPPs of an X2.8 two-ribbon solar WLF\n(SOL2023-12-14T17:02), which was well observed by the White-light Solar\nTelescope (WST) aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, with\nhigh-cadence imaging (1--2 s) in the Balmer continuum at 3600 \\AA. Combined\nwith additional multi-instrument data, we find that the enhancement of the WLF\nin both Balmer and Paschen continua shows strong spatiotemporal correlation\nwith hard X-ray (HXR) emissions. Notably, the pulses in the WST Balmer\ncontinuum exhibited a near-zero time lag with most HXR pulses, whereas soft\nX-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions showed a lag of 2--3 s. Interestingly,\nquasi-harmonic QPPs with periods of $\\sim$11 s and $\\sim$20 s were observed in\nmultiple wavelengths in the rising phase of the white-light continuum.\nFurthermore, we employed Fourier transform to spatially locate the QPPs around\n11 and 20 s, revealing that they primarily originated from the east flare\nribbon, which exhibited the most substantial continuum enhancement.

Moreover, the\noccurrence of quasi-harmonic QPPs is temporally coincident with the rapid\nelongation and separation motions of flare ribbons. Possible mechanisms for the\nquasi-harmonic QPPs have been discussed.

The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion\ndepends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in\nturn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In\nthis work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical\n(bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using\nmathematical optimisation.

Here, we perform a series of\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a CME-driven star-planet system in\norder to investigate the modulation in radio burst mechanism by a close-in\nexoplanetary system. We use a model for the stellar wind with a close-in\nexoplanet, and a CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope. We are able to\ngenerate synthetic radio burst images from our MHD simulations. We find that\nradio burst like phenomena is most likely to be observed for moderately active\nsolar like stars and close-in exoplanetary systems have significant influence\non the nature of radio burst spectrum. We find that when the planetary field is\nnot too strong, the planetary magnetosphere is pushing against the CME,\nincreasing its density so the radio burst is visible at higher frequencies.\nWhen the planetary field is very strong, the large magnetosphere does not leave\nroom for the CME shock to evolve so the radio burst is more visible in the\nlower frequencies associated with the weak compression at the flanks of the CME\nshock. In case of highly active solar-like stars, strong overlying stellar\nfields weakens the solar-like CME shock, thus generates very weak (almost\nnon-visible) radio burst signals.

This gap hinders\nthe development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that\nalign with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to\ndevise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows.\nThis study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the\nrelationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and\nLLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM).\nThe Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to\ncharacterize individual adoption behaviors. The findings reveal that\ntask-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which\nnegatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the\ncomplexity of LLM integration in software engineering. To support effective\nadoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly\nintegrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging\npeer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval.","main_category":"cs.SE","categories":"cs.SE","published":"2025-04-03T13:07:04Z"}

Enhancing\nSTEM images can reveal clearer structural details of materials. Nonetheless,\nexisting STEM image enhancement methods usually overlook unique features in the\nfrequency domain, and existing datasets lack realism and generality. To resolve\nthese issues, in this paper, we develop noise calibration, data synthesis, and\nenhancement methods for STEM images. We first present a STEM noise calibration\nmethod, which is used to synthesize more realistic STEM images. The parameters\nof background noise, scan noise, and pointwise noise are obtained by\nstatistical analysis and fitting of real STEM images containing atoms.

However, scaling imitation learning for large robot\nfoundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality\nexpert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide\nrange of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data\nprovides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and\nagent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation\nlearning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation\nrequired for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World\nModels (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data\nfor policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process\nand a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where\nindependent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply\ncontrolling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a\nforward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated\nand real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining\non large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action\npredictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation\nlearning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data\nthrough independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further\nimproving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM\noffers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for\nscalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often\ndisparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

To address this gap, we introduce\nTAGbank, a corpus of TAG derivations automatically extracted from existing\nsyntactic treebanks.

Previous studies suggested that near-surface atmospheric\ninversion (NAIV) with planetary boundary air temperature being higher than the\nair temperature adjacent to the surface, is a pronounced phenomenon in hothouse\nclimates. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that\nlower-tropospheric radiative heating is necessary but not independently\nsufficient in forming the NAIV. Instead, the dynamic heating induced by\nlarge-scale subsidence is essential. With the prescribed reasonable large-scale\nsubsidence, NAIV appears in small-domain cloud-resolving simulations, which was\nnot observed in previous studies. Surface evaporative cooling also contributes\nto the formation of the NAIV. Besides NAIV, we find that surface inversion\n(SIV) with the air adjacent to the surface being warmer than the underlying sea\nsurface is also a distinct phenomenon in hothouse climates. SIV is caused by\nstrong surface evaporative cooling and large atmospheric shortwave absorption.\nThese two types of inversion strongly stabilize the atmosphere, weaken\natmospheric circulation, dry the free troposphere, and suppress the\nhydrological cycle.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,physics.ao-ph","published":"2025-04-07T16:18:06Z"}

We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the\nalignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these\nexplanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides\nalignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response\nand the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering\nto safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to\nassess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the\ngenerated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in \"reward hacking\" by\nproducing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation\ntailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning.

To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we\npropose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which\ninduces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input\nand adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To\nmitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy,\nPOSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the\nmodel's generalization capabilities.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-08T03:57:09Z"}

Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility\npatterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay\nbetween social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic\npropagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where\nindividuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools,\nworkplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field\naveraging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean\nconnectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for\ninfection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral\nperturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and\namplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are\nnot only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing\nepidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation\ntheory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are\nshaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian\neigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between\ncommunity infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector --\nrevealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection\npatterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and\npredicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the\nfundamental role of community organization.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph,nlin.AO","published":"2025-04-08T04:02:06Z"}

Selecting the appropriate\nmodel and suitable features to efficiently capture patterns in the data is one\nof the main challenges in demand forecasting.

We propose a two-stage model-based\nclassification framework that in the first step, identifies artificially\noccurring zeroes, and then classifies demand to one of the possible types:\nregular/intermittent, intermittent smooth/lumpy, fractional/count. The\nframework utilises statistical modelling and information criteria to detect\nanomalous zeroes and then classify demand into those categories.

One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a\nperfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom\nto a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the\nsame field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form\ndistinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the\nspacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the\naverage spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random\ncouplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the\nsystem reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of\ndifferent couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way\nthat depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the\ncoupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\\sqrt{n}$ for random\ncouplings (in the limit of large $n$). Our work thus suggests that multilevel\nRabi systems could provide an attractive alternative route to accessing regimes\nof very strong coupling in light-matter systems.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-08T11:10:19Z"}

Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm\nmanipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the\nsystem changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor\nUAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external\ndisturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to\nunforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear\nadaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on\nDNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic\nand dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator.

But -- because people are\ninherently unpredictable -- it is often difficult for robots to plan safe\nbehaviors. Instead of relying on our ability to anticipate humans, here we\nidentify robot policies that are robust to unexpected human decisions.

Solving for the Nash Equilibrium of this game provides robot\npolicies that maximize safety and performance across a wide range of human\nactions.

When\nradially compressed, the resulting cut sheet buckles out-of-plane forming a\nstructure whose three-dimensional shape can be chosen by designing the tapering\nof the spokes. While the deformation of the spokes in this `hub-and-spoke'\nkirigami are approximately cylindrical (i.e.~zero Gaussian curvature and hence\nsmall elastic strain), this is not the case in the central hub. The central hub\nis deformed radially because of continuity with the spokes but, because of its\nown circular symmetry, it must develop Gaussian curvature, and hence strain. In\nthis article we quantify this strain, focussing in particular on its magnitude\nand its location. We find that the strain is localized in a boundary layer near\nthe edge of the hub region, whose size is controlled by the moment applied on\nit by the deformed spokes. We discuss the implications of our results for\navoiding material failure in flexible-electronic devices.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-09T07:00:28Z"}

Most practical implementations for detecting these races use\ntimestamps to infer causality between events and detect races based on these\ntimestamps. Such an algorithm updates timestamps (stored in vector clocks) at\nevery event in the execution, and is known to induce excessive overhead. Random\nsampling has emerged as a promising algorithmic paradigm to offset this\noverhead. It offers the promise of making sound race detection scalable. In\nthis work we consider the task of designing an efficient sampling based race\ndetector with low overhead for timestamping when the number of sampled events\nis much smaller than the total events in an execution. To solve this problem,\nwe propose (1) a new notion of freshness timestamp, (2) a new data structure to\nstore timestamps, and (3) an algorithm that uses a combination of them to\nreduce the cost of timestamping in sampling based race detection. Further, we\nprove that our algorithm is close to optimal -- the number of vector clock\ntraversals is bounded by the number of sampled events and number of threads,\nand further, on any given dynamic execution, the cost of timestamping due to\nour algorithm is close to the amount of work any timestamping-based algorithm\nmust perform on that execution, that is it is instance optimal.

A\nconsensus performing CT imaging is to make the radiation dose as low as\nreasonably achievable, i.e. the ALARA law. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end learning framework, named End2end-ALARA, that jointly optimizes dose\nmodulation and image reconstruction to meet the goal of ALARA in CT imaging.\nEnd2end-ALARA works by building a dose modulation module and an image\nreconstruction module, connecting these modules with a differentiable\nsimulation function, and optimizing the them with a constrained hinge loss\nfunction. The objective is to minimize radiation dose subject to a prescribed\nimage quality (IQ) index. The results show that End2end-ALARA is able to preset\npersonalized dose levels to gain a stable IQ level across patients, which may\nfacilitate image-based diagnosis and downstream model training. Moreover,\ncompared to fixed-dose and conventional dose modulation strategies,\nEnd2end-ALARA consumes lower dose to reach the same IQ level.

However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred\ndirectly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges\ntypically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP\nguarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.\n  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four\ndiscretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models. More\nprecisely, we design DP versions of three discretizers (uniform, quantile, and\nk-means) and reimplement the PrivTree algorithm. We find that optimizing both\nthe choice of discretizer and bin count can improve utility, on average, by\nalmost 30% across six DP marginal models, compared to the default strategy and\nnumber of bins, with PrivTree being the best-performing discretizer in the\nmajority of cases. We demonstrate that, while DP generative models with\nnon-private discretization remain vulnerable to membership inference attacks,\napplying DP during discretization effectively mitigates this risk. Finally, we\npropose an optimized approach for automatically selecting the optimal number of\nbins, achieving high utility while reducing both privacy budget consumption and\ncomputational overhead.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T14:30:30Z"}

Consequently, they\noften outperform neural network-based models on tabular datasets at a\nsignificantly lower computational cost. Nevertheless, the capability of\ntraditional tree-based ensembles to express complex relationships efficiently\nis limited by using a single feature to make splits. To improve the efficiency\nand expressiveness of tree-based methods, we propose Random Oblique Fast\nInterpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (RO-FIGS).

This helps uncover interactions between features and\nimproves performance. The proposed method is suitable for tabular datasets with\nboth numerical and categorical features.

Addressing these challenges necessitates innovative service\norchestration methods capable of seamless integration across the edge-cloud\ncontinuum. Terrestrial network-based service orchestration methods struggle to\ndeliver timely responses to growing traffic demands or support users with poor\nor lack of access to terrestrial infrastructure. Exploiting both aerial and\nterrestrial resources in service composition increases coverage and facilitates\nthe use of full computing and communication potentials. This paper proposes a\nservice placement and composition mechanism for integrated aerial-terrestrial\nnetworks over the edge-cloud continuum while considering the dynamic nature of\nthe network. The service function placement and service orchestration are\nmodeled in an optimization framework. Considering the dynamicity, the Aerial\nBase Station (ABS) trajectory might not be deterministic, and their mobility\npattern might not be known as assumed knowledge. Also, service requests can\ntraverse through access nodes due to users' mobility. By incorporating\npredictive algorithms, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches,\nthe proposed method predicts ABS locations and service requests.

However, two GW events,\nGW190814 and GW200210, the mass of one companion object falls into the mass\nregion of $(2.2-3)\\rm~M_\\odot$, and how to identify such object (e.g., as a\nlow-mass black hole (BH) or a massive neutron star (NS)) remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we propose a method to identify the mystery compact\nobject (MCO) with the mass region of $(2.2-3)\\rm~M_\\odot$ in a binary system\nvia the possible electromagnetic (EM) radiations before and after the mergers.\nA multi-band EM emission can be produced with $L\\propto(-t)^{7/4}$ (or\n$L\\propto(-t)^{-5/4}$) during the inspiral phase due to the BH battery (or\ninteraction magnetospheres) mechanism, and a bright (or dark) kilonova emission\nis powered by radioactive decay with ejecta mass ratio $q>1.7$ (or $q<1.7$)\nduring the post-merge state when MCO is as a low-mass BH (or massive NS) to\nmerger with NS. Moreover, by considering the merger system between MCO and a BH\nwhen MCO is a massive NS, we find that it requires the BH with high spin (e.g.,\n$a\\sim0.8-0.99$) to make sure the tidal disruption event (TDE) occurred, and a\nmulti-band precursor emission and bright kilonova emission can also be produced\nduring the inspiral phase and post-merge state, respectively. In any case, no\nmatter which mechanism we adopt, such precursor emissions are too weak to be\ndetected by most current telescopes unless the distance is close enough.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-10T12:34:23Z"}

This\nframework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic\ncomplexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space\nencompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and\nincorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference\nmodel updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior\ncurriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna\nBench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nchallenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits\nof the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance\nfor strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment\nrequires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability,\nestablishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and\ninterpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI","published":"2025-04-10T15:32:00Z"}

By integrating\nprinciples from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a\nflexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity\n(GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter.\nUnder the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem\ntechnique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal\nframes. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either\ncanonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon\nstructures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity\n(via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted\nby this theoretical model.

Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often\nsuboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the\nembedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising\nfast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a\nfew steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any\nperformance drop during the adaptation process.
