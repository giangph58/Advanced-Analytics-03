This work systematically explores\nthe duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and\nGalilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical\nactions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of\nmotion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with\nelectric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond\nto both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic\nunderpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,\nrevealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean\nalgebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric\nframework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime\ngeometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and\nultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity\nand exotic condensed matter systems.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el,gr-qc","published":"2025-03-27T16:24:08Z"}

In\norder to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the\nconstruction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods\nfor constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks:\nthey are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function.

Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI.

We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques.

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory\ntime, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional\ncoefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly\napplied numerical techniques such as path filtering cannot be straightforwardly\ntransferred to the two bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian\nlimits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cut-off can be accurately\nhandled with the mask assisted coarse graining (MACGIC-QUAPI) approach. Our\nfindings demonstrates that if system coupling operators to different baths do\nnot commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments\nmay be misleading.

In this\nstudy, we propose an explainable neural radiomic sequence model to identify\nregions of compromised pulmonary ventilation based on four-dimensional computed\ntomography (4DCT). A cohort of 45 lung cancer patients from the VAMPIRE dataset\nwas analyzed. For each patient, lung volumes were segmented from 4DCT, and\nvoxel-wise radiomic features (56-dimensional) were extracted across the\nrespiratory cycle to capture local intensity and texture dynamics, forming\ntemporal radiomic sequences. Ground truth ventilation defects were delineated\nvoxel-wise using Galligas-PET and DTPA-SPECT. To identify compromised regions,\nwe developed a temporal saliency-enhanced explainable long short-term memory\n(LSTM) network trained on the radiomic sequences. Temporal saliency maps were\ngenerated to highlight key features contributing to the model's predictions.\nThe proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving average (range)\nDice similarity coefficients of 0.78 (0.74-0.79) for 25 PET cases and 0.78\n(0.74-0.82) for 20 SPECT cases. The temporal saliency map explained three key\nradiomic sequences in ventilation quantification: during lung exhalation,\ncompromised pulmonary function region typically exhibits (1) an increasing\ntrend of intensity and (2) a decreasing trend of homogeneity, in contrast to\nhealthy lung tissue.","main_category":"physics.med-ph","categories":"physics.med-ph,cs.CV","published":"2025-03-31T09:47:03Z"}

An equilibrium networking formalism which\nutilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can\nbind and unbind from one another. Here, \\textit{networking} refers to the\nintroduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not\nnecessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By\ncombining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a\nweighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The\nnetworking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the\nLangevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible\nconfigurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple\nexample of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another\ndemonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in\na collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the\ndynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average\nnumber of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for\neach type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is\nintroduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above\na minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate\nthat this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied\nto a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical\npredictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-03-31T10:25:26Z"}

Second, we empirically evaluate representative\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that\naffect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g.,\nFlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM\nserving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased\nend-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of\nindividual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic\nlimitations in \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression when handling specific\nLLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in\nproduction.

We develop a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory\nPhoto-z) and apply it to the GAMA photometric catalogue.\n  Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate\nphoto-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. Using nine-band photometric data\nfrom the GAMA project, we assess the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z\nestimates to available spectroscopic redshifts. We generate synthetic galaxy\nspectra using the CIGALE software and run template set optimisation. We improve\nthe photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical\nprior is then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift\nestimates.\n  Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the\nspectroscopic redshifts. We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various\nmagnitude bins and test how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the\nactual uncertainty of the estimates. We show that the TOPz results are\nconsistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes applied to the same\ndata set.

Instead of direct quantization, we first map\nthe input latent variables into a less entangled ``style'' space and apply\nquantization using a learnable codebook.

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-02T06:40:09Z"}

However, existing UAV-assisted FEL systems face\ncritical challenges, including excessive computational demands, privacy risks,\nand inefficient communication, primarily due to the requirement for full-model\ntraining on resource-constrained UAVs. To deal with aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled ISCC (SFLSCC), a novel\nframework that integrates split federated learning (SFL) into UAV-assisted FEL.\nSFLSCC optimally partitions model training between UAVs and edge servers,\nsignificantly reducing UAVs' computational burden while preserving data\nprivacy.

Image quality assessment is often applied\nwith full-reference methods to estimate the similarity between the ground truth\nand the output images. However, current methods often show poor agreement with\nvisual perception and lead to the generation of various full-reference metrics\ntailored to specific applications. Additionally, they rely on pixel-wise\ncomparisons, emphasizing local intensity similarity while often overlooking\ncomprehensive and interpretable image quality assessment.

Multi-marker similarity provides a reliable and\ninterpretable method for image quality assessment and the generation of quality\nrankings.

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic\nsegmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions,\na comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision\nmodels under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills\nthis gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial\nrobustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to\nassess the impact of localized corruptions.

In the classic case of recommending\nmovies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like\nand don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the\nevaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training\ndata. This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to\nrecommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the\nsame task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched\nthem. This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to\navoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each\nmovie. As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the\nMovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. Our primary\nobjective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching,\ni.e. predict their watchlist. To construct this extension, we recruited\nMovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse\nset of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the\npools.

(2024a) computed the\nLMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that\nthe LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly\ncounter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of\n$\\Omega_p = -1.0 \\pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar\npattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal\nfinite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results:\nIn the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like\ngalaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that\nsuffers a slowdown from $\\Omega_p \\sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\\Omega_p \\sim 0$\nkm/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\\Omega_p \\sim\n3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before\ninteraction) pattern speed of $\\Omega_p \\sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the\nK21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct\nevidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal\ninteraction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a\nnon-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed\nslow-rotating bars.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-02T16:24:01Z"}

Specifically, it is unknown whether\nASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a\nshorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity\npatterns.\n  Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from\n28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure\noccurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns\n(states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these\nto different ASM levels.\n  Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency\n(r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p <\n0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct\nmechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:\n  Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering\nunmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these\n'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).\n  Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without\ntaper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224%\nlonger durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p\n< 0.001).\n  Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress\nspecific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and\n(ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns.

When this content requires\ncompression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, coding\nmethods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance.\nWe first show that, given the features obtained from the original and the\ndecoded images, an approach to reduce the effect of compression on a task loss\nis to perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) using the distance between\nfeatures as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such a\nrate-distortion trade-off requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding,\nand feature evaluation for each coding parameter, which is computationally\nimpractical. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make\nthe distortion term computable using block-based encoders.

Then, we\nreplace the linearized metric with a block-wise approximation, which we call\ninput-dependent squared error (IDSE). To reduce computational complexity, we\napproximate IDSE using Jacobian sketches. The resulting loss can be evaluated\nblock-wise in the transform domain and combined with the sum of squared errors\n(SSE) to address both visual quality and computer vision performance.\nSimulations with AVC across multiple feature extractors and downstream neural\nnetworks show up to 10% bit-rate savings for the same computer vision accuracy\ncompared to RDO based on SSE, with no decoder complexity overhead and just a 7%\nencoder complexity increase.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.CV","published":"2025-04-03T02:11:26Z"}

Machine learning (ML) provides a promising alternative,\nparticularly through recursive models that predict system evolution based on\npast history. While these models have shown success in predicting single\nobservables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the\nfull reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear. We extend history-based\nrecursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting\nPINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii)\nmulti-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation\nparameters (PMR-PINN). These models are applied to the spin-boson (SB) model\nand the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results show that SR-PINN and\nPSR-PINN, constrained by a narrow history window, fail to capture complex\nquantum evolution, leading to unstable long-term predictions, especially in\nnonlinear and highly correlated dynamics. In contrast, MR-PINN and PMR-PINN\nimprove accuracy by extending the forecast horizon, incorporating long-range\ncorrelations, and reducing error propagation. Surprisingly, explicitly\nincluding simulation parameters such as temperature and reorganization energy\nin PSR-PINN and PMR-PINN does not consistently enhance accuracy and can even\nreduce performance, suggesting that these effects are already encoded in the\nRDM evolution.

We show that cross-component scatterings significantly\nenhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like\nhalos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a\nnew mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from\ngravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for\nreconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in\ncentral densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo\nstructures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a\ndiagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into\nthe particle nature of SIDM.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO,hep-ph","published":"2025-04-03T06:20:10Z"}

In this work, we introduce a novel framework,\nGAMLA (Global Analytical Manifold Learning using Auto-encoding). GAMLA employs\na two-round training process within an auto-encoding framework to derive both\ncharacter and complementary representations for the underlying manifold. With\nthe character representation, the manifold is represented by a parametric\nfunction which unfold the manifold to provide a global coordinate. While with\nthe complementary representation, an approximate explicit manifold description\nis developed, offering a global and analytical representation of smooth\nmanifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets. This enables the analytical\nderivation of geometric properties such as curvature and normal vectors.\nMoreover, we find the two representations together decompose the whole latent\nspace and can thus characterize the local spatial structure surrounding the\nmanifold, proving particularly effective in anomaly detection and\ncategorization. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and\nreal-world applications, GAMLA demonstrates its ability to achieve\ncomputational efficiency and interpretability while providing precise geometric\nand structural insights.

While the code is capable of exploring general scenarios\ninvolving an minimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid, we focus on the\nregime where the scalar field dominates the dynamics, particularly in the\npost-inflationary scalar field-dominated scenario, where the universe is\ngoverned by a rapidly oscillating scalar field for a period lasting a few\n$e$-folds. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and\nquartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our\nresults confirm that a quartic potential behavior is similar to the\nradiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH formation threshold close to\nthe well-established value in radiation backgrounds.

Realistic analysis of Leukemia\nrequires White Blook Cells (WBC) localization, classification, and\nmorphological assessment. Despite deep learning advances in medical imaging,\nleukemia analysis lacks a large, diverse multi-task dataset, while existing\nsmall datasets lack domain diversity, limiting real world applicability. To\novercome dataset challenges, we present a large scale WBC dataset named Large\nLeukemia Dataset (LLD) and novel methods for detecting WBC with their\nattributes.

The goal is to determine the cyclic ordering of the\nconvex hull vertices of P as efficiently as possible. Here, efficiency is\ninterpreted in two ways: (i) minimising the number of retrievals, and (ii)\ncomputing each retrieval location quickly.\n  Prior works focused on only one of these two aspects: either minimising\nretrievals or optimising algorithmic runtime. Our contribution is the first to\nsimultaneously achieve both. Let r(F, P) denote the minimal number of\nretrievals required by any algorithm to determine the convex hull of P for a\ngiven instance (F, P).

This study investigates\nthe L-mode density limit in negative triangularity (NT) plasmas on the DIII-D\ntokamak, and the results provide novel insights into this long-standing\nchallenge. We report sustained operations at densities up to 1.8 times the\nconventional Greenwald limit with 13 MW of auxiliary heating power.\nImportantly, systematic power scans reveal distinct power scaling relationships\nfor core ($n_{e} \\propto P_{\\text{SOL}}^{0.27\\pm 0.03}$) and edge ($n_{e}\n\\propto P_{\\text{SOL}}^{0.42\\pm 0.04}$) densities, which suggest different\nlimiting mechanisms at play and point to a more nuanced picture than the\ntraditional paradigm of a single, universal density limit. In this vein,\ndetailed measurements were performed, revealing a complex interplay of\nmacroscopic profiles, radiation patterns, and turbulent transport.\nSpecifically, edge turbulent transport increased as density rose, leading to\nenhanced divertor radiation and subsequent MARFE onset. The edge density\nsaturated abruptly following MARFE formation. In contrast, the core density\ncontinues to increase, ultimately limited by enhanced turbulence that exhibits\ncharacteristics of avalanche-like transport. Consistent with enhanced\nturbulence, toroidal rotation and the $E_r \\times B$ flow shear also collapsed\napproaching the density limit. Taken together, these observations suggest that\nMARFE dynamics primarily govern the edge density limit, while turbulence-driven\ntransport dominates the core density limit.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous,\nrealistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions\namong individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain\nspatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map,\nappearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to\ncrowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the\ntimeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents'\ntype, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd\nsimulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it\ncan augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall\nframework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by\nalternating between the proposed emitter and simulator.

But should we ``teach\" the detector to\nlearn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to\nelaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and\ngeneral artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize\ndeepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face\nInconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from\nthe challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing\ninconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform\nsurrounding areas.

For this reason, pellet manufacturing is applied to up-convert\nindustrial co-products from various sectors like agriculture, forestry, human\nfood, or bio-energy production, to valorize their waste-streams into more\nvaluable products. However, processing such diverse ingredient streams presents\nan industrial challenge and raises the important scientific question: \"Under\nwhich process conditions do loose pellet ingredients bind together to form a\nmechanically rigid and durable pellet?\" In this work we provide new answers to\nthis old research question by determining the causal relationships between\nprocessing parameters and physical pellet quality.

However, traditional GPMP approaches\noften struggle with enforcing hard nonlinear constraints and rely on Maximum a\nPosteriori (MAP) solutions that disregard the full Bayesian posterior. This\nlimits planning diversity and ultimately hampers decision-making. Recent\nefforts to integrate Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) into motion\nplanning have shown promise in handling complex constraints. Nonetheless, these\nmethods still face persistent challenges, such as difficulties in strictly\nenforcing constraints and inefficiencies when the probabilistic inference\nproblem is poorly conditioned. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nconstrained Stein Variational Gaussian Process Motion Planning (cSGPMP)\nframework, incorporating a GPMP prior specifically designed for trajectory\noptimization under hard constraints. Our approach improves the efficiency of\nparticle-based inference while explicitly handling nonlinear constraints. This\nadvancement significantly broadens the applicability of GPMP to motion planning\nscenarios demanding robust Bayesian inference, strict constraint adherence, and\ncomputational efficiency within a limited time. We validate our method on\nstandard benchmarks, achieving an average success rate of 98.57% across 350\nplanning tasks, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

To\novercome this, text augmentation techniques are commonly used to increases\nsample size by transforming the original input data into artificial ones with\nthe label preserved. However, traditional text classification methods ignores\nthe relationship between augmented texts and treats them as independent samples\nwhich may introduce classification error. Therefore, we propose a novel\napproach called 'Batch Aggregation' (BAGG) which explicitly models the\ndependence of text inputs generated through augmentation by incorporating an\nadditional layer that aggregates results from correlated texts. Through\nstudying multiple benchmark data sets across different domains, we found that\nBAGG can improve classification accuracy. We also found that the increase of\nperformance with BAGG is more obvious in domain specific data sets, with\naccuracy improvements of up to 10-29%.

These properties of radial epiderivatives are\ncombined with line search methods to develop iterative solution algorithms.

One\npopular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism\nknown as a dispute game for block proposals. In these systems, validators can\nchallenge blocks that they believe contain errors, and a successful challenge\nresults in the transfer of a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward. In\nthis paper, we reveal a structural vulnerability in the mechanism: validators\nmay not be awarded a proper profit despite winning a dispute challenge.

DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of\ninformation exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length\nof the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant\nlength to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to\nprovide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the\nsize of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the\ncommunicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to\ncommunication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the\ndistributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice\nof a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the\ndata, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control\nproblems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation\ncontrol of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for\noptimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and\nwhich is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The\napplicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a\nsimulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a\nsatisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the\ncanonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the\nprediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted\non embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and\nwireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing\ncommunication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.DC,cs.RO,cs.SY","published":"2025-04-07T16:10:52Z"}

To bridge this\ngap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples\narrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the\nfull data source. In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a\ntraining dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the\nunderlying task. We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model\nstate depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature\nspace and its prediction error. Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS\n(Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection\nmethod tailored for IDS. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS\nconsistently outperforms existing selection strategies. Furthermore, PEAKS\nyields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as\ntraining data size grows on real-world datasets.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-07T16:42:09Z"}

As there are various\nreasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this\nmodel to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is\nuncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could\nbe made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this\nwork, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low\nmodel competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures\nconfidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate\nhigh-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD),\nFeature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent\nGradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these\nmethods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for\nlow model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising\nmethods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three\nmethods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nto generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the\ninclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly\nincreases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the\ncause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual\nimages in explaining low perception model competency.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-07T16:46:52Z"}

However,\nconventional reconstruction-based approaches rely on computing the\nreconstruction error between the original and denoised images, which requires\ncareful noise-strength tuning and over ten network evaluations per\ninput-leading to significantly slower detection speeds. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based anomaly detection method that\ncircumvents the need for resource-intensive reconstruction. Instead of\nreconstructing the input image, we directly infer its corresponding latent\nvariables and measure their density under the Gaussian prior distribution.\nRemarkably, the prior density proves effective as an anomaly score even when\nusing a short partial diffusion process of only 2-5 steps. We evaluate our\nmethod on the MVTecAD dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.991 at 15 FPS, thereby\nsetting a new state-of-the-art speed-AUC anomaly detection trade-off.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-08T04:23:43Z"}

Planetesimal growth has been investigated\nusing this assumption, and the oligarchic growth model is widely accepted.\nHowever, recent simulations of gas and dust evolution have shown that\nplanetesimals form only in radially limited locations -- such as at gas\npressure bumps and snowlines -- and are concentrated in ring-like regions. When\nplanetesimals are distributed in a ring-like region, scattered ones leak from\nthe ring edge, resulting in planetesimal diffusion. To investigate protoplanet\ngrowth in expanding planetesimal rings, we perform a series of $\\textit{\nN}$-body simulations. In all the simulations, protoplanet growth is well\nexplained by oligarchic growth, while the ring width expands due to\nplanetesimal scattering by the protoplanets. Massive protoplanets tend to form\nnear the ring center, and protoplanets that form far from the ring center are\nless massive than those in the center. The scaled orbital separations depend on\nneither the initial ring width nor on the total mass, and they are consistent\nwith estimates based on the oligarchic growth model and the diffused\nplanetesimal distribution.

The additional energy loss due to NMM\ncan significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the\nMESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in\nlow-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He\ncore mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical\n$Z = 1 Z_{\\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$, and $\\mu_v = 3 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\\sim 5\\%$, and the TRGB\nluminosity increases by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However,\ncontrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs\nearlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the\nadditional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core,\nreleases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the\nhydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass\nfaster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak\nluminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and\nsub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency.\nWe found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash\ncan induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot\nregion into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in\nNMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter\nthe surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment\neffect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW\nmixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to\neffectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-08T04:33:18Z"}

While prior work has shown that integrating\nsearch and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a\nperformance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of\nthe other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements:\nsearch emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas\nrecommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items.\nEffectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1)\nintegrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations,\nand (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of\nsearch and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items\nas identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential\ngeneration tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and\ntask-specific prompts.

However, the challenging\nfactors in real-world scenarios, such as insufficient lighting and rapid\nmovements, inevitably degrade the performance of RGB cameras. To address these\nchallenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising solution to\novercome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras. In this work, we rethink\nhuman activity recognition by combining the RGB and event cameras. The first\ncontribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity\nrecognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset\ngaps. It contains 300 categories of everyday real-world actions with a total of\n107,646 paired videos covering various challenging scenarios. Inspired by the\nphysics-informed heat conduction model, we propose a novel multi-modal heat\nconduction operation framework for effective activity recognition, termed\nMMHCO-HAR. More in detail, given the RGB frames and event streams, we first\nextract the feature embeddings using a stem network. Then, multi-modal Heat\nConduction blocks are designed to fuse the dual features, the key module of\nwhich is the multi-modal Heat Conduction Operation layer. We integrate RGB and\nevent embeddings through a multi-modal DCT-IDCT layer while adaptively\nincorporating the thermal conductivity coefficient via FVEs into this module.\nAfter that, we propose an adaptive fusion module based on a policy routing\nstrategy for high-performance classification.

Thus, for a precise interpretation\nof STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a\ntheoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going\nbeyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show\nwhy, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with\nexperimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and\nTersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate\ninterpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe\nthe process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of\nmany-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states. This can be\naccomplished by the concept of so-called Dyson orbitals.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el","published":"2025-04-08T10:45:59Z"}

However, the large MoE model size still introduces\nsubstantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on\nresource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU\ninference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert\nloading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation\npatterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping\nstrategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU\nschedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes,\nstructures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that\nimproves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache\nmanagement system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling\nstrategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven\ninter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to\nmitigate expert activation instability.

In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular\nwaveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift\nregion, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with\nexisting methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane\nby using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization\nproblem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts\nobserved in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous\nrather than discrete.

Within the beam cross section, the\ntotal electromagnetic field is the superposition of the incident beam and the\nscattered wave. Using the Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory (GLMT) as a vehicle to\naccess such scattering problems, we discuss the mathematical modeling of this\ninterference at short, large but finite and infinite distances from the\nscatterer. We show how to eliminate the errors that can arise from improper\nmodeling in the most straight-forward manner, that is superimposing the\nscattered wave with the closed-form expression for the Gaussian beam at a\nfinite distance from the particle. GLMT uses a low order beam model ($s^1$),\nbut using the known higher order models ($s^3$, $s^5$, $s^7$, ...) would not\nmitigate these errors as we discuss. The challenge lies in an appropriate\ndescription of the Gaussian beam at arbitrary distances from its focus, not in\nits description on the scale of a particle (located in or near the focus) nor\nin the expressions for the scattered field. Hence, the solutions described here\ncan readily be extended to light scattering frameworks other than GLMT and are\nthus also relevant for non-spherical particles.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-04-08T14:20:57Z"}

In a way, such methods can\nresemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally\nassuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating\nPreferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing\npromising results both in performance and diversity maintenance.

The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high\nmomentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and\nspin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a\nlinear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits\nspin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and\nnext-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other\nruthenate trimers in this series.

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.

In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy\nfor the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's partial progress\nin the concurrent cache.

G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a\nhigh-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of\nthe few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on\nscales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric\nobservations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete\nthe study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming\nregion, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope $850\n\\mu$m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial\nresolution of $\\sim$0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field\nin the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC\nfrom $\\sim$50,000 au to $\\sim$260 au scales. The large-scale ($\\sim$5 pc)\norientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent\nwith that observed at the core ($\\sim$4,000 au) and circumstellar ($\\sim$260\nau) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these\ndifferent scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster,\nwhose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the\ngravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic\nfield strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the\nDavis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04--0.09 mG.

DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a\nlower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value\nsuggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where\ndomain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is\npresent. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the\nregions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature\nextraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove\nthe low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific\ninformation such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However,\nsince low-frequency components also contain important information such as\ncolor, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from\n0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential\ninformation. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features.

More specifically, these investigations examined the underlying effects\nof bulk density, cohesion, and exhaust flow characteristics on viscous erosion\nrates and crater formation using Lunar highlands simulant (LHS-1), Lunar mare\nsimulant (LMS-1), LHS-1D (Dust) simulants, and 40-80 um glass beads in\natmosphere.

Existing methods\non code watermarking, leveraging the idea from the backdoor research, embed\nstealthy triggers as watermarks.Despite their high resilience against dilution\nattacks and backdoor detections, the robustness has not been fully evaluated.\nTo fill this gap, we propose DeCoMa, a dual-channel approach to Detect and\npurify Code dataset waterMarks.To overcome the high barrier created by the\nstealthy and hidden nature of code watermarks, DeCoMa leverages dual-channel\nconstraints on code to generalize and map code samples into standardized\ntemplates. Subsequently, DeCoMa extracts hidden watermarks by identifying\noutlier associations between paired elements within the standardized templates.\nFinally, DeCoMa purifies the watermarked dataset by removing all samples\ncontaining the detected watermark, enabling the silent appropriation of\nprotected code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DeCoMa, covering 14 types of code watermarks and 3\nrepresentative intelligent code tasks (a total of 14 scenarios).

Therefore,\ninter-cell interference (ICI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are crucial\nissues that must be managed efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. In\nradio frequency (RF) networks, rate splitting (RS) is proposed as a\ntransmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously following a certain\nstrategy. It was shown that RS provides high data rates compared to orthogonal\nand non-orthogonal interference management schemes.

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers.

Traditionally, humans are\nperceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots\nshould strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if\nhumans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed \"long\nshort-term intention prediction\". This task requires robots can predict the\nlong-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short\nterm intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention.\nMeanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the\nshort-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and\nsuggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention\nmodel to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train\nthis intention model.

Experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist\nrobots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and\nshort-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term\nand short-term intentions of humans.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-10T09:50:18Z"}

The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier\ncycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable\nfrequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps.\nThese topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each\nphotonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability\nin frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous\ntopological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial\ngauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge\nflux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger\nsingle-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge\nflux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders.\nWe also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux\ngovern the photon dynamics in various regimes.

However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the\nsubtlety of actions. To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised\nMAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled. We first evaluate\ntraditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these\nmethods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error\naccumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the\ncommon practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as\npseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which\nexplicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the\noffline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.\nMoreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically\nfilter noisy labels of different classes.

Here, we present\nDynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM\nwith a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or\nre-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and\nreuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving\ninsights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance\nsubstantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth\nlabels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than\ndoubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across\nquestions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to\n99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks\nprone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o\nand Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated\ncode, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic\nchallenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks.\nClaude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro\nproblems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise,\ntransferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or\nstatic retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly,\nwithout modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC\nas a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the\ndivide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven\nlearning characteristic of human cognition.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-10T17:57:33Z"}

Despite extensive historical observations, disentangling\nthe contributions of internal and forced variability remains debated, largely\ndue to the uncertain magnitude of anthropogenic aerosols.\n  Here, we show that, after removing CO$_{2}$-congruent variability,\nmultidecadal temperature variability in instrumental data is largely\nattributable to internal processes of oceanic origin. This follows from an\nemergent relationship, identified in historical climate model simulations,\nbetween the driver of variability in oceanic regions and the land-ocean\nvariance ratio in the mid-latitudes. Thus, climate models with higher residual\n(non-CO$_{2}$) forced variability, largely linked to volcanic and anthropogenic\naerosols, exhibit more spatially coherent and amplified temperature patterns\nover land compared to observations. In contrast, models with higher internal\nvariability agree better with the instrumental data. Our results underscore\nthat internal modes of ocean-driven variability may be too weak in many climate\nmodels, and that current projections may be underestimating the range of\ninternal variability in regions with high oceanic influence.","main_category":"physics.ao-ph","categories":"physics.ao-ph","published":"2025-04-14T07:01:55Z"}

However, these\nmethods either have a fixed receptive field for local learning or significant\ncomputational burdens for global learning, limiting the super-resolution\nperformance. To solve this problem, State Space Models, notably Mamba, is\nintroduced to efficiently model long-range dependencies in images with linear\ncomputational complexity. Relying on the Mamba and the fact that low-resolution\nimages rely on global information to compensate for missing details, while\nhigh-resolution reference images need to provide more local details for\naccurate super-resolution, we propose a global and local Mamba network\n(GLMamba) for multi-modality medical image super-resolution. To be specific,\nour GLMamba is a two-branch network equipped with a global Mamba branch and a\nlocal Mamba branch. The global Mamba branch captures long-range relationships\nin low-resolution inputs, and the local Mamba branch focuses more on\nshort-range details in high-resolution reference images. We also use the deform\nblock to adaptively extract features of both branches to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. A modulator is designed to further enhance deformable\nfeatures in both global and local Mamba blocks. To fully integrate the\nreference image for low-resolution image super-resolution, we further develop a\nmulti-modality feature fusion block to adaptively fuse features by considering\nsimilarities, differences, and complementary aspects between modalities.

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during\ngraph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on\nthese new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm\nis effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In\nthis paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient\ndescent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph\nconvolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood\naggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability\nthrough experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the\nselection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of\nCL objective.

Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE\nsystem via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the\ntask of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function\n$f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which\nrequires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and\nnecessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that\nencodes $f(x)$.

Although\nextensive research has explored their resulting functions and behaviors, the\nunderlying computations often remain elusive. Even the fundamental task of\nquantifying the \\textit{amount} of computation performed by a dynamical system\nremains under-investigated. In this study we address this challenge by\nintroducing a novel framework to estimate the amount of computation implemented\nby an arbitrary physical system based on empirical time-series of its dynamics.\nThis framework works by forming a statistical reconstruction of that dynamics,\nand then defining the amount of computation in terms of both the complexity and\nfidelity of this reconstruction. We validate our framework by showing that it\nappropriately distinguishes the relative amount of computation across different\nregimes of Lorenz dynamics and various computation classes of cellular\nautomata. We then apply this framework to neural activity in\n\\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, as captured by calcium imaging. By analyzing\ntime-series neural data obtained from the fluorescent intensity of the calcium\nindicator GCaMP, we find that high and low amounts of computation are required,\nrespectively, in the neural dynamics of freely moving and immobile worms. Our\nanalysis further sheds light on the amount of computation performed when the\nsystem is in various locomotion states.

However, different defenses target different\nclasses of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully\nconsidered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel\nattack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate\nthe attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.\nOne way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to\nthe core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E\nstate, which is responsible for triggering redos.\n  We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural\ndefense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.

While semi-supervised\nmethods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer\nfrom high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently,\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection.\nHowever, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder\nreal-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways\nin human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that\nintegrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly\nconfidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than\nthe entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM\nfor elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to\ndomain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal\npatterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs.\nDuring inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts\nfor anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast\nand slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively\ncombines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable\ndetection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications\nwith high reliability requirements.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-14T15:30:03Z"}

Existing research typically focuses on\ncandidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require\ncontributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated\nby the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair\nonline selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to\nfoster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for\nthis problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for\ncrowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill\ntemporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario,\nrecruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing\ncapacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a\nlong-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$\ndimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass\na competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any\nachievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this\nend, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance\nwith the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging\nmarginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a\ncompetitive ratio of $1/(4\\sqrt{d} \\lceil \\log_2 d \\rceil)$. For the\nunknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of\n$\\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions.

However, some recent structural results on\nthe combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes\nsuggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS\ncodes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding\nadversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors.

In particular, we revisit some\nclassical results on decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes (aka subfield\nevaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher-Kiayias-Yung\n(BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis.
