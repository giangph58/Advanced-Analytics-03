This work systematically explores\nthe duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and\nGalilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical\nactions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of\nmotion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with\nelectric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond\nto both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic\nunderpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,\nrevealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean\nalgebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric\nframework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime\ngeometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and\nultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity\nand exotic condensed matter systems.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el,gr-qc","published":"2025-03-27T16:24:08Z"}

In\norder to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the\nconstruction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods\nfor constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks:\nthey are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison\nof the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in\norder to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-03-27T16:33:52Z"}

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment.

An equilibrium networking formalism which\nutilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can\nbind and unbind from one another. Here, \\textit{networking} refers to the\nintroduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not\nnecessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By\ncombining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a\nweighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The\nnetworking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the\nLangevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible\nconfigurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple\nexample of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another\ndemonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in\na collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the\ndynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average\nnumber of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for\neach type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is\nintroduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above\na minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate\nthat this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied\nto a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical\npredictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-03-31T10:25:26Z"}

We find LISA\nwill detect MBH mergers in diverse host galaxies, including lower-mass and\nsatellite galaxies. These hosts are $\\sim 50$ times more star-forming than\ntypical galaxies of the same mass, forming a tight power-law in SFR--$M_{\\rm\ngal}$ space: ${\\rm SFR} = 10^{-8} M_{\\rm\ngal}^{0.9}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, independent of redshift.

We develop enhanced analyses for quantum simulation of Schr\\\"odinger\noperators with black-box potential via the pseudo-spectral method, providing\nexplicit resource estimates independent of wavefunction assumptions. These\nbounds are applied to assess the complexity of optimization through QHD. Our\nfindings pertain to unconstrained convex optimization in $d$ dimensions. In\ncontinuous time, we demonstrate that QHD, with suitable parameters, can achieve\narbitrarily fast convergence rates. The optimization speed limit arises solely\nfrom the discretization of the dynamics, mirroring a property of the classical\ndynamics underlying QHD. Considering this cost, we show that a $G$-Lipschitz\nconvex function can be optimized to an error of $\\epsilon$ with\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{1.5}G^2 R^2/\\epsilon^2)$ queries. Moreover, under\nreasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation,\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(d/\\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary.

By employing a gating network to route input\ntokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the\ncorresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is\nchallenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation,\nwhich leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and\ninsufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by\nnumerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level.\nPrevious works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized\nby the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to\nstatic execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at\nruntime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a\nhigher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration\nand specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others\n(collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific\nsubset of experts (specialized).

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency.

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic\nsegmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions,\na comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision\nmodels under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills\nthis gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial\nrobustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to\nassess the impact of localized corruptions.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01887v1","title":"Dual mechanism of Anti-Seizure Medications in controlling seizure\n  activity","summary":"Background: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can reduce seizure duration, but\ntheir precise modes of action are unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether\nASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a\nshorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity\npatterns.\n  Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from\n28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure\noccurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns\n(states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these\nto different ASM levels.\n  Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency\n(r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p <\n0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct\nmechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:\n  Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering\nunmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these\n'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).\n  Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without\ntaper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224%\nlonger durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p\n< 0.001).\n  Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress\nspecific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and\n(ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight\nthe complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized\ndosing strategies for epilepsy management. These findings may also have\nimplications in understanding the effects of ASMs on cognition and mood.","main_category":"q-bio.NC","categories":"q-bio.NC","published":"2025-04-02T16:44:51Z"}

We extend history-based\nrecursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting\nPINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii)\nmulti-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation\nparameters (PMR-PINN).

Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce\nand interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using\nrealistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the\nhost galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis,\nand simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the\nBPASS code using three different kick prescriptions.

Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit\ncompared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing\ndifferent kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement\nwhen including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%,\nwhile lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets.

For early-type hosts,\nthe predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch\nthreshold applied.

In this paper, we ask:\nHow can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most\nfacial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake\ngenerators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting\ninconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach\" the detector to\nlearn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to\nelaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and\ngeneral artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize\ndeepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face\nInconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from\nthe challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing\ninconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform\nsurrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by\nthe generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization\nstems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or\nboth of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level\npseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA\nand USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we\nemploy a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module\nthat uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the\nFIA.

However, our study reveals a\nsurprising contradiction to this prevailing perspective. Through extensive\nexperiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based\nin-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning\nvariants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales\nand benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected\nphenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical\nexplanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality\ndriving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning\nfalters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from\ndemonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual\ndistance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers\ndespite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative\nunderperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process,\neven as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes.

This scatter decreases as the timescale\nover which SFRs are averaged increases, declining to a non-negligible ~0.15 -\n0.25 dex at 2 Gyr, underscoring the importance of long-timescale SFH diversity\nto the SFMS scatter. Furthermore, galaxies currently above (below) the SFMS\ntend to have been above (below) the SFMS for at least ~1 Gyr, providing\nevidence that individual galaxies may follow different median tracks through\nSFR$-\\mathrm{M}_*$ space.

Perhaps the most studied defect in a vdW material is the negatively\ncharged boron vacancy center ($V^{-}_{B}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).\nHowever, many of the $V^{-}_{B}$ electronic and spin transition rates and\nbranching ratios are not fully known.

In this paper, we address this\nproblem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish\nthemselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited\nfleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the\nfleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and\nin turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each\narea. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand\ndevelopment. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time\nfulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach.

The additional energy loss due to NMM\ncan significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the\nMESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in\nlow-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He\ncore mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical\n$Z = 1 Z_{\\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$, and $\\mu_v = 3 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\\sim 5\\%$, and the TRGB\nluminosity increases by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However,\ncontrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs\nearlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the\nadditional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core,\nreleases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the\nhydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass\nfaster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak\nluminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and\nsub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency.\nWe found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash\ncan induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot\nregion into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in\nNMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter\nthe surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment\neffect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW\nmixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to\neffectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-08T04:33:18Z"}

By performing transient\nreflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the\ngate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally\ndistinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we\nfind that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron\nextraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises\nfrom interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the\nexcess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence\ngenerates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the\nconduction band offset with external electric field.

Although\nthis standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental\ndata, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics,\npostulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e.,\nindividual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers\nthis contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical\nquestion rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical\nstrongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on\none-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation\nof STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a\ntheoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going\nbeyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show\nwhy, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with\nexperimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and\nTersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate\ninterpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe\nthe process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of\nmany-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states.

For a periodic\nsystem consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\\mathbf\nr}_j$ where $j=1,2,\\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density\n$\\rho({\\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived\nelectrostatic energy can be expressed as, \\[ {\\mathcal U} = \\sum_{i<j}^N\nq_iq_j\\nu({\\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \\sum_{j=1}^N q_j \\int_V d{\\mathbf\nr}_0\\,\\rho({\\mathbf r}_0) \\nu({\\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_V d{\\mathbf\nr}_0 \\int_V d{\\mathbf r}_1\\,\\rho({\\mathbf r}_0)\\rho({\\mathbf r}_1) \\nu({\\mathbf\nr}_{01}), \\] where ${\\mathbf r}_{ij}={\\mathbf r}_i - {\\mathbf r}_j$ is the\nrelative vector and $\\nu({\\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise\ninteraction. The charge density $\\rho({\\mathbf r})$ is free of\nDelta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit\ndiscontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated\nsystem by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\\lvert {\\mathbf r} \\rvert$ or\nother modified Coulomb interactions with $\\nu({\\mathbf r})$. For a particular\nsystem of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the\nimplementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of\nthe background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent\npotentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.","main_category":"physics.comp-ph","categories":"physics.comp-ph,physics.chem-ph,physics.plasm-ph","published":"2025-04-08T13:27:26Z"}

Additionally, unimodular waveforms are preferred due to hardware\nlimitations. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular\nwaveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift\nregion, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with\nexisting methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane\nby using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization\nproblem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts\nobserved in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous\nrather than discrete. The problem of interest is formulated as an optimization\nproblem with infinite constraints along with unimodular constraints. To the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been studied yet. We\npropose to reformulate a non-convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) to a\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) with a finite number of constraints and a\nrank-one constraint, which is then solved by the sequential rank-one constraint\nrelaxation (SROCR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing methods in achieving a lower PSL of AF over a\ncontinuous Doppler frequency shift region of interest. Moreover, the designed\nwaveform can effectively prevent false alarms when detecting a target with an\narbitrary velocity.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-08T13:37:22Z"}

In a way, such methods can\nresemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally\nassuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating\nPreferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing\npromising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method\nmimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences\nrather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such,\nPIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially\ntaking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness\npressure.

Simple\ntime-series statistics such as variance or autocorrelation can be taken as\nproxies for the phenomenon, making their increase a useful early warning signal\n(EWS) for catastrophic regime shifts. However, the modelling basis justifying\nthe use of these EWSs is usually a finite-dimensional stochastic ordinary\ndifferential equation, where a mathematical proof for the aptness is possible.\nOnly recently has the phenomenon of CSD been proven to exist in\ninfinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), which\nare more appropriate to model real-world spatial systems. In this context, we\nprovide an essential extension of the results for SPDEs under a specific noise\nforcing, often referred to as red noise. This type of time-correlated noise is\nomnipresent in many physical systems, such as climate and ecology. We approach\nthe question with a mathematical proof and a numerical analysis for the\nlinearised problem. We find that also under red noise forcing, the aptness of\nEWSs persists, supporting their employment in a wide range of applications.\nHowever, we also find that false or muted warnings are possible if the noise\ncorrelations are non-stationary. We thereby extend a previously known\ncomplication with respect to red noise and EWSs from finite-dimensional\ndynamics to the more complex and realistic setting of SPDEs.","main_category":"math.PR","categories":"math.PR,math.DS","published":"2025-04-08T16:41:34Z"}

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.

MPNs\nenhance dynamic adaptability and resource management, while NDTs enable\nreal-time simulation, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making.\nTheir integration into 3GPP Release 20 will be instrumental in shaping a\nflexible and future-proof mobile ecosystem. These innovations exemplify how\nresearch-driven solutions can align with 6G standardization objectives. By\napplying the proposed methodology, we aim to establish a systematic pathway for\ntransitioning research into impactful 3GPP contributions, ultimately driving\nthe evolution of next-generation networks.","main_category":"cs.NI","categories":"cs.NI,cs.ET","published":"2025-04-09T08:39:38Z"}

G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a\nhigh-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of\nthe few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on\nscales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric\nobservations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete\nthe study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming\nregion, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope $850\n\\mu$m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial\nresolution of $\\sim$0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field\nin the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC\nfrom $\\sim$50,000 au to $\\sim$260 au scales. The large-scale ($\\sim$5 pc)\norientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent\nwith that observed at the core ($\\sim$4,000 au) and circumstellar ($\\sim$260\nau) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these\ndifferent scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster,\nwhose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the\ngravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic\nfield strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the\nDavis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04--0.09 mG.

Since outdoor environments represent the primary application\nscenario for mobile communications, this paper presents the first comprehensive\nreview and summary of multi-scenario and multi-frequency channel\ncharacteristics based on extensive outdoor new mid-band channel measurement\ndata, including UMa, UMi, and O2I. Specifically, a survey of the progress of\nthe channel characteristics is presented, such as path loss, delay spread,\nangular spread, channel sparsity, capacity and near-field spatial\nnon-stationary characteristics. Then, considering that satellite communication\nwill be an important component of future communication systems, we examine the\nimpact of clutter loss in air-ground communications. Our analysis of the\nfrequency dependence of mid-band clutter loss suggests that its impact is not\nsignificant. Additionally, given that penetration loss is frequency-dependent,\nwe summarize its variation within the FR3 band.

It is expected that these states are related to\nMajorana bound states (MBSs) in longer chains and that the tunable nature of\nthis setup makes it a promising platform to study MBSs. However, realistic\nsystems can only host highly, but not perfectly, localized near-zero-energy\nstates, called imperfect PMMs. It has been shown that these imperfect PMMs can\nevolve into trivial states unrelated to MBSs when the chain is extended. Such\nstates are called false PMMs, whereas PMMs that evolve into MBSs in long chains\nare called true PMMs. Here, using a microscopic model of QD-superconductor\narrays, we consider properties of false PMMs and the circumstances under which\nthey appear. In two-site systems, we find that the origin of many false PMMs\ncan be related to zero-energy states occurring in the absence of\nsuperconductivity and we use this analytic understanding to characterize the\nfalse PMMs that are typical for different regions of parameter space. In\nthree-site systems, we show that false PMMs can occur via the same mechanism as\nfor two-site systems, but we also find them in regions of parameter space where\nthey are not predicted to exist, thus hinting that the physics of false PMMs\ncan be richer in longer chains.

This gap in understanding stems largely from the lack of\ntheoretical tools for analyzing their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. To address\nthis challenge, we develop a system of approximate master equations that\ncapture the behavior of local search algorithms in constraint satisfaction\nproblems. Our framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with the phase\ndiagrams of two paradigmatic algorithms: Focused Metropolis Search (FMS) and\ngreedy-WalkSAT (G-WalkSAT) for random 3-SAT. The equations not only confirm the\nnumerical observation that G-WalkSAT's algorithmic threshold is nearly\nparameter-independent, but also successfully predict FMS's threshold beyond the\nclustering transition. We also exploit these equations in a decimation scheme,\ndemonstrating that the computed marginals encode valuable information about the\nlocal structure of the solution space explored by stochastic algorithms.\nNotably, our decimation approach achieves a threshold that surpasses the\nclustering transition, outperforming conventional methods like Belief\nPropagation-guided decimation.

DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a\nlower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value\nsuggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where\ndomain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is\npresent. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the\nregions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature\nextraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove\nthe low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific\ninformation such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However,\nsince low-frequency components also contain important information such as\ncolor, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from\n0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential\ninformation. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features.

An in-context\ntrained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to\nidentify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based\nattention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid\ncell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching\nresults in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate\ncontrol between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in\nstate-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with\ndiverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative\nmetrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency,\nvisual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain\ntraining-free, image-based text-to-video generation.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-09T13:11:09Z"}

Due to the introduction of the quantum parameter $\\xi$, the BH equation\nof state splits into two branches. One branch reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS\ncase as $\\xi\\to0$, with its phase transition pressure lower than the critical\npressure; another branch's phase transition pressure is greater than the\ncritical pressure.

Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying\nthe edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different\nforgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included\nin the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we\npresent an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL).

We prove that any such\nmetric $g$ forces the universal cover $(\\tM, \\tg)$ to split isometrically as a\nRiemannian product $(\\Hyp, g_0) \\times (\\R, c^2 du^2)$, where $(\\Hyp, g_0)$ is\nthe hyperbolic plane equipped with a complete $\\pi_1(\\Sigma)$-invariant metric\nand $c>0$ is a constant. This affirmatively resolves the question and extends\nrigidity theorems known for flat tori and manifolds of non-positive curvature.\nWe present two proofs: the main proof relies on the analysis of Busemann\nfunctions associated with the lifted $S^1$-action, while an alternative proof\nutilizes Jacobi field analysis along the flow lines of the corresponding\nKilling field. Both approaches show that the absence of conjugate points\ncompels the horizontal distribution orthogonal to the Killing field flow to be\nparallel and integrable, leading to a global isometric splitting via the de\nRham theorem. Several geometric and dynamical consequences follow from this\nrigid structure.","main_category":"math.DG","categories":"math.DG","published":"2025-04-10T10:05:48Z"}

Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force\nexerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag\nforce can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron\nliquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in\nthe bilayer.

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during\ngraph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on\nthese new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm\nis effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In\nthis paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient\ndescent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph\nconvolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood\naggregation on interaction graphs.

The ability to accurately transmit and receive data is the basis for\nhigh-speed communications and precise sensing, where a fundamental requirement\nis an accurate in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) modulation. For sensing,\nimperfections in IQ modulation lead to two critical issues in the\nrange-Doppler-map (RDM) in form of an increased noise floor and the presence of\nghost objects, degrading the accuracy and reliability of the information in the\nRDM.

We propose two scenarios for\nthis problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for\ncrowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill\ntemporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario,\nrecruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing\ncapacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a\nlong-term employee acquisition strategy.

Our main results are threefold: First, by\nimposing physically realistic boundary conditions and viscosity constraints, we\nprove that the solutions of the system smust necessarily take the following\nsteady-state form $(\\rho,u,v,w,p)=(\\rho_s,0,v_s,0, p_s)$. These solutions are\ncharacterized by both geostrophic balance, given by $fv_s-\\frac{\\partial\np_s}{\\partial x}=\\rho_s\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x}$ and hydrostatic\nbalance, expressed as $-\\frac{\\partial p_s}{\\partial z}=\\rho_s\\frac{\\partial\n\\Psi}{\\partial z}$. Second, we establish that any steady-state solution\nsatisfying the conditions $\\nabla \\rho_s=\\delta (x,z)\\nabla \\Psi$ with\n$v_s(x,z)=a_0x+a_1$ is linearly unstable when the conditions\n$\\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}>0$ and $(f+\\alpha_0)\\leq 0$ are simultaneously\nsatisfied. This instability under the condition $\\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}>0$\ncorresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Third, although the\ninherent Rayleigh-Taylor instability could potentially amplify the velocity\naround unstable steady-state solutions (heavier density over lighter one), we\nrigorously demonstrate that for any sufficiently smooth initial data, the\nsolutions of the system asymptotically converge to a neighborhood of a\nsteady-state solution in which both the zonal and vertical velocity components\nvanish. Finally, under a moderate additional assumption, we demonstrate that\nthe system converges to a specific steady-state solution. In this state, the\ndensity profile is given by $\\rho=-\\gamma \\Psi+\\beta$, where $\\gamma$ and\n$\\beta$ are positive constants, and the meridional velocity $v$ depends solely\nand linearly on $x$ variable.","main_category":"math.AP","categories":"math.AP","published":"2025-04-15T03:10:27Z"}

Recent advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for causal discovery by providing\ndomain expert knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can\neffectively process observational data for causal discovery. In this work, we\nexplore the potential of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery by integrating\nobservational data for LLM-based reasoning. Specifically, we examine whether\nLLMs can effectively utilize observational data through two prompting\nstrategies: pairwise prompting and breadth first search (BFS)-based prompting.\nIn both approaches, we incorporate the observational data directly into the\nprompt to assess LLMs' ability to infer causal relationships from such data.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets show that incorporating observational data\nenhances causal discovery, boosting F1 scores by up to 0.11 point using both\npairwise and BFS LLM-based prompting, while outperforming traditional\nstatistical causal discovery baseline by up to 0.52 points. Our findings\nhighlight the potential and limitations of LLMs for data-driven causal\ndiscovery, demonstrating their ability to move beyond textual metadata and\neffectively interpret and utilize observational data for more informed causal\nreasoning.

Despite decades of work yielding efficient algorithmic\n(AL) solutions and, more recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, a clear\ncomparative understanding is elusive. This gap stems from the absence of a\nunified evaluation framework, standardized datasets, and accessible ground\ntruths, all of which hinder systematic analysis and fair benchmarking. To\novercome these barriers, we introduce BEACON: a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to rigorously evaluate both AL and ML-based subgraph counting methods.\nBEACON provides a standardized dataset with verified ground truths, an\nintegrated evaluation environment, and a public leaderboard, enabling\nreproducible and transparent comparisons across diverse approaches. Our\nextensive experiments reveal that while AL methods excel in efficiently\ncounting subgraphs on very large graphs, they struggle with complex patterns\n(e.g., those exceeding six nodes). In contrast, ML methods are capable of\nhandling larger patterns but demand massive graph data inputs and often yield\nsuboptimal accuracy on small, dense graphs. These insights not only highlight\nthe unique strengths and limitations of each approach but also pave the way for\nfuture advancements in subgraph counting techniques.

Methods and Materials: We used the RADCURE dataset,\nconsisting of 3,346 patients with H&N cancer treated with definitive\n(chemo)radiotherapy. A probabilistic BN was constructed to model dependencies\namong clinical, anatomical, and treatment variables. The Markov Blanket (MB) of\ntwo-year survival (SVy2) was extracted and used to train a logistic regression\nmodel. After excluding incomplete cases, a temporal split yielded a train/test\n(2,174/820) dataset using 2007 as the cutoff year. Model performance was\nassessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC), C-index, and Kaplan-Meier (KM)\nsurvival stratification. Model fit was further evaluated using a log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) test. Causal inference was performed using do-calculus\ninterventions on MB variables. Results: The MB of SVy2 included 6 clinically\nrelevant features: ECOG performance status, T-stage, HPV status, disease site,\nthe primary gross tumor volume (GTVp), and treatment modality. The model\nachieved an AUC of 0.65 and C-index of 0.78 on the test dataset, significantly\nstratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups (log-rank p < 0.01).

In diffusion-based T2V models, the attention mechanism is a\ncritical component. However, it remains unclear what intermediate features are\nlearned and how attention blocks in T2V models affect various aspects of video\nsynthesis, such as image quality and temporal consistency. In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth perturbation analysis of the spatial and temporal attention\nblocks of T2V models using an information-theoretic approach. Our results\nindicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing\nand layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and\nthe aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy\nattention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas\nlow-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame\nstructure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video\nquality and enable text-guided video editing. These methods rely entirely on\nlightweight manipulation of the attention matrices in T2V models. The efficacy\nand effectiveness of our methods are further validated through experimental\nevaluation across multiple datasets.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-16T12:37:08Z"}

Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal\nperformance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure\ndata-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample\nefficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid\nmethods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an\nend-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a\nself-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry\n(IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and\npredicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in\na bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control\nactions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and\npredicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a\nself-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based\nperception with the interpretable model-based control.
