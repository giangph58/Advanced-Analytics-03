While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.

However, when looking at how\nindividual data points are affected by pruning, it turns out that a particular\nsubset of data points always bears most of the brunt (in terms of reduced\naccuracy) when pruning, but this effect goes unnoticed when reporting the mean\naccuracy of all data points.

Our approach introduces synthetic proxy images through two\nkey innovations: (1) Dual-path score distillation: We employ a dual-path\narchitecture to distill motion priors from both real and synthetic data,\npreserving static details from the original painting while learning dynamic\ncharacteristics from synthetic frames. (2) Hybrid latent fusion: We integrate\nhybrid features extracted from real paintings and synthetic proxy images via\nspherical linear interpolation in the latent space, ensuring smooth transitions\nand enhancing temporal consistency. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach significantly improves semantic alignment with text prompts while\nfaithfully preserving the unique characteristics and integrity of the original\npaintings. Crucially, by achieving enhanced dynamic effects without requiring\nany model training or learnable parameters, our framework enables plug-and-play\nintegration with existing I2V methods, making it an ideal solution for\nanimating real-world paintings.

Our approach utilizes the GatorTron model with\nMulti-Task Prompt-based Learning, enhanced by a hybrid retrieval preprocessing\nstep to identify relevant text segments. It out- performs baseline methods,\nachieving an average F1-score of 90% across all menstrual characteristics,\ndespite being trained on fewer than 100 annotated clinical notes. The retrieval\nstep consistently improves performance across all approaches, allowing the\nmodel to focus on the most relevant segments of lengthy clinical notes. These\nresults show that combining multi-task learning with retrieval improves\ngeneralization and performance across menstrual charac- teristics, advancing\nautomated extraction from clinical notes and supporting women's health\nresearch.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-03-31T14:07:03Z"}

This paper investigates\nthe feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and\nhow to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web\napplications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and\nfailing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and\npinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps,\nverifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using\nour benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed\nto a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best\nperforming implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation,\nSeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA\nimplementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement).\nHowever, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a\npromising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be\naddressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for\nrobust, low maintenance test automation.

However, it often requires large annotated training datasets,\nwhich limits its scalability in clinical settings. To address this challenge,\nsemi-supervised learning is a well-established approach that leverages both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised\nteacher-student framework for biomedical image segmentation, inspired by the\nrecent success of generative models. Our approach leverages denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate segmentation masks by progressively\nrefining noisy inputs conditioned on the corresponding images. The teacher\nmodel is first trained in an unsupervised manner using a cycle-consistency\nconstraint based on noise-corrupted image reconstruction, enabling it to\ngenerate informative semantic masks. Subsequently, the teacher is integrated\ninto a co-training process with a twin-student network.

The analysis results show that the inserted MoS2 layer\ndoes not change the main transmission mechanism (space charge limited\nconduction) of the device, but affects the regulating function of interfacial\npotential barrier, the effect also is related to the location of MoS2 inserted\ninto the layer.

However, scaling imitation learning for large robot\nfoundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality\nexpert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide\nrange of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data\nprovides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and\nagent-environment interactions.

In this work, we present Unified World\nModels (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data\nfor policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process\nand a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where\nindependent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply\ncontrolling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a\nforward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator.

While the dynamics associated with these\nattractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered\nclass of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions,\nseparated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic,\nbeyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real\nfixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed\npoint itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in\nnongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment\nof straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic\nattractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor,\nwhich may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the\nexistence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with\ndifferent types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of\ndiscontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to\nthe appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the\nthree-dimensional space.

From this model, we extract key parameters for the proximitized\ngraphene, including the superconducting energy gap Delta and the effective\nlength scale Ls of the superconducting regions. Near the Dirac point, we\nobserve a minimal Ls and a maximal Delta, aligning with the theory that the gap\nin strongly disordered superconductors increases as the coherence length of\nlocalized pairs decreases. This suggests that spatial confinement in a\nlow-density superconductor leads to an effective increase in the\nsuperconducting gap.","main_category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall","published":"2025-04-07T12:27:11Z"}

We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five\nfictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining\nfive distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules\nfor control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be\nappropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety\ncase for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs,\nhighlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating\nmisalignment risk.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CR","published":"2025-04-07T16:52:52Z"}

We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the\nalignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these\nexplanations.

The RM lacks a mechanism to\nassess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the\ngenerated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in \"reward hacking\" by\nproducing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation\ntailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning.

However, when (iii)\nbichromatic driving is realized using two distinct driving gates, we see a\nbreakdown of $g$-tensor formalism: the Rabi frequency cannot be expressed using\nthe $g$-tensor and its derivatives. We find that beyond the $g$-tensor and its\nderivatives, three additional parameters are needed to capture the dynamics. We\ndemonstrate our general results by assuming an electron (hole) confined in a\ncircular quantum dot, subjected to Rashba spin-orbit interaction.","main_category":"cond-mat.mes-hall","categories":"cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph","published":"2025-04-08T07:25:13Z"}

Selecting the appropriate\nmodel and suitable features to efficiently capture patterns in the data is one\nof the main challenges in demand forecasting. In reality, this becomes even\nmore complicated when the recorded sales have zeroes, which can happen\nnaturally or due to some anomalies, such as stockouts and recording errors.\nMistreating the zeroes can lead to the application of inappropriate forecasting\nmethods, and thus leading to poor decision making. Furthermore, the demand\nitself can have different fundamental characteristics, and being able to\ndistinguish one type from another might bring substantial benefits in terms of\naccuracy and thus decision making. We propose a two-stage model-based\nclassification framework that in the first step, identifies artificially\noccurring zeroes, and then classifies demand to one of the possible types:\nregular/intermittent, intermittent smooth/lumpy, fractional/count. The\nframework utilises statistical modelling and information criteria to detect\nanomalous zeroes and then classify demand into those categories. We then argue\nthat different types of demand need different features, and show empirically\nthat they tend to increase the accuracy of the forecasting methods compared to\nthose applied directly to the dataset without the generated features and the\ntwo-stage framework. Our general practical recommendation based on that is to\nuse the mixture approach for intermittent demand, capturing the demand sizes\nand demand probability separately, as it seems to improve the accuracy of\ndifferent forecasting approaches.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ME","published":"2025-04-08T10:45:30Z"}

Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm\nmanipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the\nsystem changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor\nUAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external\ndisturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to\nunforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear\nadaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on\nDNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic\nand dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator. Subsequently, the\nadaptive RISE controller is proposed with a DNN feedforward term to effectively\naddress both internal and external challenges. By employing Lyapunov\ntechniques, the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error signals are\nguaranteed rigorously. Notably, this paper marks a pioneering effort by\npresenting the first DNN-based adaptive RISE controller design accompanied by a\ncomprehensive stability analysis. To validate the practicality and robustness\nof the proposed control approach, several groups of actual hardware experiments\nare conducted. The results confirm the efficacy of the developed methodology in\nhandling real-world scenarios, thereby offering valuable insights into the\nperformance of the dual-arm aerial manipulator system.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO","published":"2025-04-08T12:43:45Z"}

In this\nwork, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\nStructure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of\nprimordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level\nof the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT\npredictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the\nEFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO\nto constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that\nwhile such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ndata, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low\nredshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial\noscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the\nwell-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation\nprocesses. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy\npower spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to\nderive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features.

Theory morphisms and logical relations are common patterns of such\ninductive constructions. They allow representing the translation and the proofs\nof the invariants as a set of translation rules, corresponding to the cases of\nthe inductions. Importantly, establishing the invariants is reduced to checking\na finite set of, typically decidable, statements. Therefore, in a framework\nsupporting theory morphisms and logical relations, translations that fit one of\nthese patterns become much easier to formalize and to verify. The\n$\\lambda\\Pi$-calculus modulo rewriting is a logical framework designed for\nrepresenting and translating between formal systems that has previously not\nsystematically supported such patterns. In this paper, we extend it with theory\nmorphisms and logical relations. We apply these to define and verify invariants\nfor a number of translations between formal systems. In doing so, we identify\nsome best practices that enable us to obtain elegant novel formalizations of\nsome challenging translations, in particular type erasure translations from\ntyped to untyped languages.","main_category":"cs.LO","categories":"cs.LO","published":"2025-04-10T08:02:40Z"}

Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often\nsuboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the\nembedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising\nfast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a\nfew steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any\nperformance drop during the adaptation process.

To this\nend, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms\nlayout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for\nprocessing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective\nretrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout,\ntogether with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT\nreasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both\nsemantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance without requiring training or fine-tuning.

The key technical novelty of our method, called Forward-Backward\nRepresentations with Conditional-Policy Regularization, is to train\nforward-backward representations to embed the unlabeled trajectories to the\nsame latent space used to represent states, rewards, and policies, and use a\nlatent-conditional discriminator to encourage policies to ``cover'' the states\nin the unlabeled behavior dataset. As a result, we can learn policies that are\nwell aligned with the behaviors in the dataset, while retaining zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities for reward-based and imitation tasks. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in a challenging humanoid\ncontrol problem: leveraging observation-only motion capture datasets, we train\nMeta Motivo, the first humanoid behavioral foundation model that can be\nprompted to solve a variety of whole-body tasks, including motion tracking,\ngoal reaching, and reward optimization. The resulting model is capable of\nexpressing human-like behaviors and it achieves competitive performance with\ntask-specific methods while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised RL and\nmodel-based baselines.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-15T10:41:11Z"}

Furthermore, APF is\nhighly susceptible to local minima, compromising motion reliability in complex\nenvironments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hybrid\nobstacle avoidance algorithm-Deflected Simulated Annealing-Adaptive Artificial\nPotential Field (DSA-AAPF)-which combines an improved simulated annealing\nmechanism with an enhanced APF model.

However, these metrics do not directly evaluate\nthe physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly\ncritical concern in scientific and engineering applications.\n  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine\nlearning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system.\nAddressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine\nlearning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in\napplications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting\nerror metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the\nunderlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed\ndynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse\npersistence ($\\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --\ne.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)\nand higher $\\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical\nconsistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that\nmeasure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\\theta$ versus their correct\nvalues.

Existing studies often neglect the interdependence between\nsuccessive anomalous weather events and their collective impact on wind and\nsolar power output. Additionally, conventional modeling approaches struggle to\naccurately capture the nonlinear fluctuations induced by these weather\nconditions. To address this gap, this study proposes an uncertainty modeling\nmethod based on stochastic optimization and scenario generation.

This is one of the\nreasons for the large discrepancy between the experimental estimate of the\ncavitation threshold and the theory's predictions.\n  Our investigation aims to identify nucleation thresholds in various\nsubstances characterized by different physical properties. The experiments were\nperformed by initiating nucleation through ultrasound at 24 kHz. The cavitation\nonset was studied using a novel procedure based on high-speed imaging and\nacoustic measurements with a hydrophone.

Thus far, both of them have been explored for ion-range\nverification in an independent way. However, the simultaneous combination of\nPET and PGI within the same imaging framework may open-up the possibility to\nexploit more efficiently all radiative emissions excited in the tissue by the\nion beam. Here we report on the first pre-clinical implementation of an hybrid\nPET-PGI imaging system, hereby exploring its performance over several ion-beam\nspecies (H, He and C), energies (55 MeV to 275 MeV) and intensities\n(10$^7$-10$^9$ ions/spot), which are representative of clinical conditions. The\nmeasurements were carried out using the pencil-beam scanning technique at the\nsynchrotron accelerator of the Heavy Ion Therapy centre in Heidelberg utilizing\nan array of four Compton cameras in a twofold front-to-front configuration. The\nresults demonstrate that the hybrid PET-PGI technique can be well suited for\nrelatively low energies (55-155 MeV) and beams of protons. On the other hand,\nfor heavier beams of helium and carbon ions at higher energies (155-275 MeV),\nrange monitoring becomes more challenging owing to large backgrounds from\nadditional nuclear processes. The experimental results are well understood on\nthe basis of realistic Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, which show a satisfactory\nagreement with the measured data. This work can guide further upgrades of the\nhybrid PET-PGI system towards a clinical implementation of this innovative\ntechnique.","main_category":"physics.med-ph","categories":"physics.med-ph,physics.ins-det","published":"2025-04-15T15:14:28Z"}

While typical state-of-the-art approaches rely on\nregularity conditions that are difficult to verify and often misaligned with\nthe actual mechanisms driving posterior consistency, we propose an alternative\nframework centered on a simple yet general condition we call ''sequential\nidentifiability''. This concept strengthens the usual identifiability\nassumption by requiring that any sequence of parameters whose induced\ndistributions converge to the true data-generating distribution must itself\nconverge to the true parameter value. We demonstrate that sequential\nidentifiability, combined with a standard Kullback--Leibler prior support\ncondition, is sufficient to ensure posterior consistency. Moreover, we show\nthat failure of this condition necessarily entails a specific and pathological\nform of oscillations of the model around the true density, which cannot exist\nwithout intentional design. This leads to the important insight that posterior\ninconsistency may be safely ruled out, except in the unrealistic scenario where\nthe modeler possesses precise knowledge of the data-generating distribution and\ndeliberately incorporates oscillatory pathologies into the model targeting the\ncorresponding density. Taken together, these results provide a unified\nperspective on both consistency and inconsistency in parametric settings,\nsignificantly expanding the class of models for which posterior consistency can\nbe rigorously established.

The trajectory\ndispersion propagates with flight time and ultimately determines landing\naccuracy. Therefore, to achieve high-precision landing, this note proposes a\nnovel online trajectory dispersion control method. Based on a Parameterized\nOptimal Feedback Guidance Law (POFGL), two key components of the proposed\nmethod are designed: online trajectory dispersion prediction and real-time\nguidance parameter tuning for trajectory dispersion optimization. First, by\nformalizing a parameterized probabilistic disturbance model, the closed-loop\ntrajectory dispersion under the POFGL is predicted online. Compared with the\ncovariance control guidance method, a more accurate trajectory dispersion\nprediction is achieved by using generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion\nand pseudospectral collocation methods. Second, to ensure computational\nefficiency, a gradient descent based real-time guidance parameter tuning law is\ndesigned to simultaneously optimize the performance index and meet the landing\nerror dispersion constraint, which significantly reduces the conservativeness\nof guidance design compared with the robust trajectory optimization method.\nNumerical simulations indicate that the trajectory dispersion prediction method\ncan achieve the same accuracy as the Monte Carlo method with smaller\ncomputational resource; the guidance parameter tuning law can improve the\noptimal performance index and meet the desired accuracy requirements through\ndirectly shaping the trajectory dispersion.","main_category":"physics.space-ph","categories":"physics.space-ph","published":"2025-04-16T09:20:16Z"}

It is\nthe building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first\nthree moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is\nessential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in\npseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation.\nAt the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the\nClifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor\npowers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been\nlimited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits\n$n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our\nfirst result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and\ncomputes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$.

In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to\nsolve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray\npath. The approach consists of two main steps.

However, FDY conv relies on temporal\naverage pooling, which treats all temporal frames equally, limiting its ability\nto capture transient sound events such as alarm bells, door knocks, and speech\nplosives. To address this limitation, we propose temporal attention pooling\nfrequency dynamic convolution (TFD conv) to replace temporal average pooling\nwith temporal attention pooling (TAP). TAP adaptively weights temporal features\nthrough three complementary mechanisms: time attention pooling (TA) for\nemphasizing salient features, velocity attention pooling (VA) for capturing\ntransient changes, and conventional average pooling for robustness to\nstationary signals. Ablation studies show that TFD conv improves average PSDS1\nby 3.02% over FDY conv with only a 14.8% increase in parameter count. Classwise\nANOVA and Tukey HSD analysis further demonstrate that TFD conv significantly\nenhances detection performance for transient-heavy events, outperforming\nexisting FDY conv models.

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various\nmodalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex\nclinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies\nhave demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer\nquestions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical\ncontext due to the patch-level data with limited information from public\ndatasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the\nscalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we\nintroduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as\nChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using\n10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and\nevaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We\ndemonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using\nChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and\nreports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context\nfrom various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential\nto assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of\nWSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.CV","published":"2025-04-17T15:33:17Z"}

While electron correlation effects in the\nnickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an\nexemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the\nnon-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using\nadvanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free\nparameters. The weak EPC strength $\\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be\ngreatly enhanced ($\\sim$4$\\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the\n$C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the\nflat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency\nphonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon\nsoftening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure\naround 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our\npredictions.

Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,\nand lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and\ndisease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand\ncardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an\nindividual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly\nexploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have\nbegun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data\nand focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a\ncomprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a\ncomprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of\nindividual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,\nViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling\na complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with\ndetailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This\nmulti-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including\ncardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and\nclassification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified\nframework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging\nfeatures and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific\nmodels toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,\nhighlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in\ncardiac analysis.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV","published":"2025-04-17T15:46:19Z"}

This\nclass covers both unbiased and biased instances and comprises common estimators\nas special cases, including SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD. Next, we design\na novel accelerated variance-reduced forward-backward splitting (FBS) algorithm\nusing these estimators to solve finite-sum and stochastic generalized\nequations.
