The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their\npositions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could\nsignificantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this\npotential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional,\ncomplex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within\na rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and\ncrescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its\nplacement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant\nfrequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of\ninternal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node\ngeneration. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect\nratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the\nchannel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor,\nwhich is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic\nenergy per cycle. We show that additional nodes emerge in the presence of a\nscatterer, but they come at the cost of reduced acoustic pressure and energy in\nthe channel. In summary, this study provides information on generating complex\nnodes in a standing wave acoustic cavity at the fundamental frequency, which\nhas numerous applications for particle manipulation in acoustofluidic devices.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-03-27T17:24:41Z"}

Unlike\nthe extensively studied image domain, limited research has explored the threat\nof backdoor attacks on the reconstruction of symbols in semantic communication\n(SemCom) systems. Previous work has investigated such backdoor attacks at the\ninput level, but these approaches are infeasible in applications with strict\ninput control. In this paper, we propose a novel attack paradigm, termed\nChannel-Triggered Backdoor Attack (CT-BA), where the backdoor trigger is a\nspecific wireless channel. This attack leverages fundamental physical layer\ncharacteristics, making it more covert and potentially more threatening\ncompared to previous input-level attacks. Specifically, we utilize channel gain\nwith different fading distributions or channel noise with different power\nspectral densities as potential triggers. This approach establishes\nunprecedented attack flexibility as the adversary can select backdoor triggers\nfrom both fading characteristics and noise variations in diverse channel\nenvironments. Moreover, during the testing phase, CT-BA enables automatic\ntrigger activation through natural channel variations without requiring active\nadversary participation.

We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of\nmagnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust\ncontained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the\nthin-disk limit.

This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental\nprocesses such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into\nalready occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of\nlight scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\\rm\nf}$, where $N_{\\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.\nHere, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a\nquasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak\ninteractions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have\na dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)\nbeyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can\ncompletely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive\nones increase the scattering rate.

To\ntackle this challenge, we develop the topological prior (TP), a new prior\nconstructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent\npairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions\nunder reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure\nand discontinuities of the function. The TP prior, however, only exists in a\ndiscretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior\nmeasure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a TP-Gaussian\nhybrid prior, where the TP component detects sharp discontinuities in the\nfunction, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring\na well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed TP prior\ndemonstrates effects similar to the classical total variation (TV) prior but\noffers greater flexibility and broader applicability due to three key\nadvantages. First, it is defined on a general topological space, making it\neasily adaptable to a wider range of applications. Second, the persistent\ndistance captures richer topological information compared to the discrete TV\nprior. Third, it incorporates more adjustable parameters, providing enhanced\nflexibility to achieve robust numerical results.

In the present\narticle, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and\nwas already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical\ncontradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost\nentirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may\nsurprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much\nof which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out\nsupposed internal contradictions. Like the first paradox, this one arises from\nthe premise of a universe entirely filled with polyhedra. However, in this\ncase, the contradiction stems from the absence of void outside it. In the first\nsection, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect\nmathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and\nhollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support\nthe necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect\nmathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot\nmove at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction\nin Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier\napparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living\nbeing, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and\nreforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues\nconcerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of\nobservations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between\nintelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of\nPlato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal'\ninterpretation.

The two popular\nframeworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard\nmodel effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory\n(HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new\nphysics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken\nsymmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a\nsinglet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase\neffective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate\nfields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear\nrealization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our\napproach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level,\nwe compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector\nboson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung\nprocess at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT\nreproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the\nregions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the\nelectroweak scale.

We\naddress the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by\nproposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision\ntransformers rooted in evidential learning.

Additionally,\nP2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation.\nThrough comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan,\nand OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F.

Existed methods for shifting the\nfrequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect,\nhowever, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz,\nfurthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of\na photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the\nfrequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is\nusually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between\nthese methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter\nbased on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a\nfrequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap.

This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and\n$f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of\nassessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard\ngravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the\ngrowth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by\nimplementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration\nspace, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis\ndemonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by\nnon-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\\beta$\nparameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small\n(non-linear) scales.

Although sparse training methods can reduce communication overhead\nand computational burden in FL, they are often not used in practice for the\nfollowing key reasons: (1) data heterogeneity makes it harder for clients to\nreach consensus on sparse models compared to dense ones, requiring longer\ntraining; (2) methods for obtaining sparse masks lack adaptivity to accommodate\nvery heterogeneous data distributions, crucial in cross-device FL; and (3)\nadditional hyperparameters are required, which are notably challenging to tune\nin FL. This paper presents SparsyFed, a practical federated sparse training\nmethod that critically addresses the problems above.

This creates a range of\nchallenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and\nassessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to\naccomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is\ntime-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that\nautomates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system,\n(2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software\nquality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM).\nSpecifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system\nthat is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of\narchitectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the\narchitectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the\ncurrent requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world\nexamples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural\nchoices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a\nparticular influence on a system's architecture.

Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised\nmodel that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf\nfeatures are used in a linear probing setup. In particular, our model is\ntrained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked\nScene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in\na bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our\nexperiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised\napproaches by a large margin. The model and training code can be found at our\nGithub repository (https://github.com/phermosilla/msm).","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-09T09:19:49Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07483v1","title":"Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation","summary":"Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for\nwhich automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger\nprograms. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program\ntest suites.","main_category":"cs.PL","categories":"cs.PL,cs.SE","published":"2025-04-10T06:25:17Z"}

This effect led to a large\nbody of research focused on mining such subspaces, known as subspace selection.\nHowever, as the precise nature of the MV effect was not well understood,\ntraditional methods had to rely on heuristic-driven search schemes that\nstruggle to accurately capture the true structure of the data. Properly\nidentifying these subspaces is critical for unsupervised tasks such as outlier\ndetection or clustering, where misrepresenting the underlying data structure\ncan hinder the performance. We introduce Myopic Subspace Theory (MST), a new\ntheoretical framework that mathematically formulates the Multiple Views effect\nand writes subspace selection as a stochastic optimization problem.

This approach avoids any exhaustive search over the\nfeature space while ensuring that the intrinsic data structure is preserved.\nExperiments on 42 real-world datasets show that using V-GAN subspaces to build\nensemble methods leads to a significant increase in one-class classification\nperformance -- compared to existing subspace selection, feature selection, and\nembedding methods.

We then develop an efficient\nmethod for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli\nerrors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT\nsolvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We\nformalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a\nverified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier,\nVeri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the\nefficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different\nverification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of\n14 verified stabilizer codes.","main_category":"cs.PL","categories":"cs.PL,quant-ph","published":"2025-04-10T13:28:49Z"}

Advancements in nanopore based approaches require\nconcomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the\npoint of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current\nsensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal\nreadout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip\ntransimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic\ncapacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies.\nThis review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures\nclassified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design\nimplementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay\nbetween noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse\ntransimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on\ncharacterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and\noperational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in\nprior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance\nrange limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B\nsystem to the designs reported in literature.

Different from simple tasks, real-world code generation\nusually depends on specific programming environment (e.g., code repositories).\nIt contains complex dependencies and domain knowledge, which is needed for LLMs\nwhen generating target code snippets. In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a\nretrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve\nsupportive codes for real-world code generation. Beginning with the\nrequirement, CodeRAG first constructs a requirement graph for the current\nrepository, and retrieves sub- and similar- requirement nodes of the target\nrequirement on the graph. Meanwhile, it models the repository into a DS-code\ngraph. CodeRAG then maps these relevant requirement nodes into their\ncorresponding code nodes, and treats these code nodes as archors for LLM\nreasoning on DS-code graph. Finally, CodeRAG introduces a code-oriented agentic\nreasoning process, seamlessly allowing LLMs to reason and comprehensively\nretrieve for supportive codes which LLMs' need for generating correct programs.\nExperiments show that CodeRAG achieves significant improvements (i.e.,\nincreasing 40.90 and 37.79 Pass@1 on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro on DevEval) compared\nto no RAG scenarios. Further tests on reasoning LLMs (i.e., QwQ-32B) confirm\nCodeRAG's adaptability and efficacy across various types of LLMs. In addition,\nCodeRAG outperforms commercial programming products such as Copilit and Cursor.\nWe further investigate the performance of our framework on different dependency\ntypes, and observe that CodeRAG is superior in generating examples where target\ncodes invoke predefined cross-file code snippets.

Marginal\ndistributions were modeled using the Skewed Generalized T family. This\neffectively captures asymmetry and heavy tails and makes the model suitable for\npredictive inferences in real world scenarios. Furthermore, the model was\napplied to rolling windows of financial returns from the USA, India and Hong\nKong economies to understand the influence of dynamic market conditions. The\napproach addresses the limitations of models that rely on parametric\nassumptions. By accounting for asymmetry, heavy tails, and cross-correlated\nasset prices, the proposed method offers a robust solution for optimizing\ndiverse portfolios in an interconnected financial market. Through adaptive\nmodeling, it allows for better management of risk and return across varying\neconomic conditions, leading to more efficient asset allocation and improved\nportfolio performance.","main_category":"q-fin.PM","categories":"q-fin.PM,stat.AP","published":"2025-04-16T17:27:52Z"}

Ariel achieves the high photometric stability on transit timescales\nrequired to detect the spectroscopic signatures of chemical elements with a\npayload design optimized for transit photometry that either eliminates known\nsystematics or allows for their removal during data processing without\nsignificantly degrading or biasing the detection. Jitter in the spacecraft's\nline of sight is a source of disturbance when measuring the spectra of\nexoplanet atmospheres. We describe an improved algorithm for de-jittering Ariel\nobservations simulated in the time domain.

However, existing synthetic\nstrategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying\nphysical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies\nthat hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we\nintroduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through\nMath-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and\nemploys a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality\nEstimator(SQE).

Graph\nsummarization is a logical next step, but current methods for general-purpose\ngraph summarization are inadequate for causal DAG summarization. This paper\naddresses these challenges by proposing a causal graph summarization objective\nthat balances graph simplification for better understanding while retaining\nessential causal information for reliable inference. We develop an efficient\ngreedy algorithm and show that summary causal DAGs can be directly used for\ninference and are more robust to misspecification of assumptions, enhancing\nrobustness for causal inference. Experimenting with six real-life datasets, we\ncompared our algorithm to three existing solutions, showing its effectiveness\nin handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generate summary DAGs that\nensure both reliable causal inference and robustness against misspecifications.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.DB,stat.ME","published":"2025-04-21T08:01:32Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15922v1","title":"Language Models to Support Multi-Label Classification of Industrial Data","summary":"Multi-label requirements classification is a challenging task, especially\nwhen dealing with numerous classes at varying levels of abstraction. The\ndifficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to\ntrain a supervised classifier. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require\ntraining data and can potentially address this problem. This paper investigates\nthe performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial\ndataset. We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed\nto support requirements tracing. We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using\ndifferent embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number\nof parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large\nnumber of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama. Our ground truth includes 377\nrequirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces. For the evaluation, we adopt\ntraditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\\beta$, as well as a\nnovel label distance metric Dn. This aims to better capture the\nclassification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of\nhow far the results are from the ground truth. 1) The top-performing model on 5\nout of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04,\nwhile BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum\n$F_\\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04. 2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the\nbest classification results compared to LLMs. Thus, addressing the problem in\npractice is feasible as limited computing power is needed. 3) The model\narchitecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence)\nsignificantly affects the classifier's performance. We conclude that using ZSL\nfor multi-label requirements classification offers promising results.

The upcoming generation of radio\ntelescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data\nreduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these\nexperiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we\ndeal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the\nclassical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the\npast, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing\nnumerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a\nnew algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the\ndata reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation\nof instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components\nfitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to\nderive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis\nfunctions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior\nreconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their\nsuperior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of\nsuper-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and\nsubminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining\nthese advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than\nthe classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic\nframework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward\nto include in future data reduction pipelines. With its accelerated convergence\nspeed, and smaller residual, Autocorr-CLEAN may be an important asset for the\ndata analysis in the future.","main_category":"astro-ph.IM","categories":"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-22T17:33:55Z"}

Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction\nsequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their\nrepresentations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific\nintents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for\nbeauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise,\ndisrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction\nsequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may\nmislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding\nspace and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To\naddress these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive\nlearning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate\nitem sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more\nreliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first\nperforms intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build\nintent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the\ntarget interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating\npositive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive\nlearning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these\nintent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared\nto existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy\nand sparse data conditions.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-22T17:55:56Z"}

However, the necessity of complex\nnumbers--as opposed to their mere convenience--remains a subject of debate.\nSeveral alternative formulations of quantum mechanics using real numbers have\nbeen proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate that standard quantum mechanics,\nformulated in a complex Hilbert space, admits an equivalent reformulation in a\nreal Kahler space. By establishing a natural isomorphism between the operator\ntheories of the complex Hilbert space and the real Kahler space, we prove the\nequivalence of the two formulations including composite system.\n  This Kahler-space framework preserves all essential features of quantum\nmechanics while offering a key advantage: it inherently incorporates a\nHamiltonian symplectic structure analogous to classical mechanics. This\nstructural alignment provides a unified geometric perspective for both\nclassical and quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the ergodicity of\nfinite-dimensional quantum systems becomes manifest in this framework,\nresolving interpretational ambiguities present in conventional complex\nformulations.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-23T16:01:25Z"}

In this work, we\nfocus on the properties of the zero mode subspace in quantum kinetically\nconstrained models with a $U(1)$ particle-conservation symmetry.

First, we observe that the\nsimultaneous presence of constraints and chiral symmetry generally leads to a\nparametric increase in the number of zero modes due to the fragmentation of the\nmany-body Hilbert space into disconnected sectors. Second, we generalize the\nconcept of compact localized states from single particle physics and introduce\nthe notion of collective bound states. We formulate sufficient criteria for\ntheir existence, arguing that the degenerate zero mode subspace plays a central\nrole, and demonstrate bound states in both example models.

To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the\nacquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential.\nHowever, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is\nperformed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails\nestimating the CSI for all $M \\times M$ switch array permutations, resulting in\na total of $M!$ possible configurations, to identify the optimal one that\nmaximizes the channel gain. This process leads to long uplink training\nintervals, which degrade spectral efficiency and increase uplink energy\nconsumption.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a\ntemperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static\ncrystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing\nbetween the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large\ninternal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra.

A key\nchallenge is to balance the level of model detail and the computational\nefficiency, while using physically interpretable parameters to facilitate\nmeaningful comparisons with biological data.\n  For this purpose, we present the DLCM-solver (discrete Laplacian cell\nmechanics), a flexible and efficient computational solver for spatial and\nstochastic simulations of populations of cells, developed from first principle\nto support mechanistic investigations. The solver has been designed as a module\nin URDME, the unstructured reaction-diffusion master equation open software\nframework, to allow for the integration of intra-cellular models with\nextra-cellular features handled by the DLCM. The solver manages discrete cells\non a fixed lattice and reaction-transport events in a continuous-time Markov\nchain. Space-continuous micro-environment quantities such as pressure and\nchemical substances are supported by the framework, permitting a variety of\nmodeling choices concerning chemotaxis, mechanotaxis, nutrient-driven cell\ngrowth and death, among others.\n  An essential and novel feature of the DLCM-solver is the coupling of cellular\npressure to the curvature of the cell populations by elliptic projection onto\nthe computational grid, with which we can include effects from surface tension\nbetween populations.\n  We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by implementing benchmark\nproblems of cell sorting, cellular signaling, tumor growth, and chemotaxis\nmodels. We additionally formally analyze the computational complexity and show\nthat it is theoretically optimal for systems based on pressure-driven cell\nmigration. In summary, the solver balances efficiency and a relatively fine\nresolution, while supporting a high level of interpretability.","main_category":"q-bio.QM","categories":"q-bio.QM,q-bio.PE","published":"2025-04-29T09:12:16Z"}

The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance\nbetween the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated\nmodel. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through\nexperience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address\nbias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a\nwell-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity\nor limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge\nin the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method,\ncalled Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high\nplasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our\nBOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual\nclassifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be\nintegrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for\ntransferring knowledge across the two classifiers.

First, we show\nthat the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT\nunder MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous.

In this setup, the learner communicates the\nchosen arm to play to an agent over an erasure channel with probability\n$\\epsilon \\in [0,1)$; if an erasure occurs, the agent continues pulling the\nlast successfully received arm; the learner always observes the reward of the\narm pulled. In past work, we considered the case where the agent cannot convey\nfeedback to the learner, and thus the learner does not know whether the arm\nplayed is the requested or the last successfully received one. In this paper,\nwe instead consider the case where the agent can send feedback to the learner\non whether the arm request was received, and thus the learner exactly knows\nwhich arm was played. Surprisingly, we prove that erasure feedback does not\nimprove the worst-case regret upper bound order over the previously studied\nno-feedback setting. In particular, we prove a regret lower bound of\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{KT} + K / (1 - \\epsilon))$, where $K$ is the number of arms and\n$T$ the time horizon, that matches no-feedback upper bounds up to logarithmic\nfactors. We note however that the availability of feedback enables simpler\nalgorithm designs that may achieve better constants (albeit not better order)\nregret bounds; we design one such algorithm and evaluate its performance\nnumerically.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-29T16:10:05Z"}

Prior research on\nDP has extended beyond data in the flat Euclidean space and addressed data on\ncurved manifolds, e.g., diffusion tensor MRI, social networks, or organ shape\nanalysis, by adding perturbations along geodesic distances.

However, a\nfundamental issue arises: Individuals typically perceive participation as\nadvantageous only after an institution is established, creating a paradox: How\ncan institutions form if no one will join before a critical mass exists? We\nterm this conundrum the institution bootstrapping problem and propose that\nmisperception, specifically, agents' erroneous belief that an institution\nalready exists, could resolve this paradox. By integrating well-documented\npsychological phenomena, including cognitive biases, probability distortion,\nand perceptual noise, into a game-theoretic framework, we demonstrate how these\nfactors collectively mitigate the bootstrapping problem. Notably, unbiased\nperceptual noise (e.g., noise arising from agents' heterogeneous physical or\nsocial contexts) drastically reduces the critical mass of cooperators required\nfor institutional emergence. This effect intensifies with greater diversity of\nperceptions. We explain this counter-intuitive result through asymmetric\nboundary conditions: proportional underestimation of low-probability sanctions\nproduces distinct outcomes compared to equivalent overestimation. Furthermore,\nthe type of perceptual distortion, proportional versus absolute, yields\nqualitatively different evolutionary pathways. These findings challenge\nconventional assumptions about rationality in institutional design,\nhighlighting how \"noisy\" cognition can paradoxically enhance cooperation.\nFinally, we contextualize these insights within broader discussions of\nmulti-agent system design and collective action.

It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate\nexecutable actions (\\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.\nTraining a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which\nthe GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the\ntask, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on\nhistorical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of\ninsufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of\nbacktracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above\nchallenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding\nand backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI\nsamples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and\nunified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.\nMoreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action\nfrom the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that\nled to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence\nbetween GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules\nof the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI","published":"2025-05-01T09:27:13Z"}

In many of these cases, the treated and\ncontrol units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our\napproach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied\nat specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic\ncontrol applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact,\nthe extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects\nwith distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This\ninnovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying\nproximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the\nspatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical\nregression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian\nprocess to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas\nof different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent,\nreflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and\nhave similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly\npertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction.

To\naddress this, we propose DeCo (Task Decomposition and Skill Composition), a\nmodel-agnostic framework compatible with various multi-task IL models, designed\nto enhance their zero-shot generalization to novel, compositional, long-horizon\n3D manipulation tasks. DeCo first decomposes IL demonstrations into a set of\nmodular atomic tasks based on the physical interaction between the gripper and\nobjects, and constructs an atomic training dataset that enables models to learn\na diverse set of reusable atomic skills during imitation learning. At inference\ntime, DeCo leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to parse high-level\ninstructions for novel long-horizon tasks, retrieve the relevant atomic skills,\nand dynamically schedule their execution; a spatially-aware skill-chaining\nmodule then ensures smooth, collision-free transitions between sequential\nskills.
