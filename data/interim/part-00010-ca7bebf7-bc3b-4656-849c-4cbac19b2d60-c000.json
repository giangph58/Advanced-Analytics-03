This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are\npromising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward\ngeneral-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-03-27T16:35:02Z"}

We leverage this spiking inner loop\nalongside a lateral connection mechanism to iteratively refine the substructure\nselection network, enhancing model adaptability and expressivity. Specifically,\nwe design a lateral connection framework comprising a learnable lateral matrix\nand a lateral mapping function, both implemented using spiking neurons, to\ndynamically update lateral connections. Through mathematical modeling, we\nestablish that the proposed lateral update mechanism, under a well-defined\nlocal objective, aligns with biologically plausible synaptic plasticity\nprinciples.

While a model trained\non the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited\nto a single register, combining well-performing registers like\nHow-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major\nimprovements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key\ndifferences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as\npretraining data.

Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders\nto fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus\ntowards designing low-complexity iterative decoders. However, empirical\ninvestigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having\na high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper\nis to analyze the decoding failures of the \\emph{hypergraph-product} and\n\\emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these\nfailures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of\nthese codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1)\nstabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers,\nand (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes\nutilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes.\nThe dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a\nstraightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent\nthese trapping sets.

However, the conventional phased array\nused in VSM is vulnerable to privacy breaches, as an eavesdropper can extract\nsensitive vital sign information by analyzing the reflected radar signals. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy in radar-based VSM\nby modifying the radar transmitter hardware, specifically by strategically\nselecting the transmit antennas from the available antennas in the transmit\narray. By dynamically selecting which antennas connect or disconnect to the\nradio frequency chain, the transmitter introduces additional phase noise to the\nradar echoes, generating false frequencies in the power spectrum of the\nextracted phases at the eavesdropper's receiver. The antenna activation pattern\nis designed to maximize the variance of the phases introduced by antenna\nselection, which effectively makes the false frequencies dominate the spectrum,\nobscuring the actual vital sign frequencies. Meanwhile, the authorized\nreceiver, having knowledge of the antenna selection pattern, can compensate for\nthe phase noise and accurately extract the vital signs. Numerical experiments\nare conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\nenhancing privacy while maintaining vital sign monitoring.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-02T15:28:07Z"}

In the classic case of recommending\nmovies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like\nand don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the\nevaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training\ndata. This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to\nrecommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the\nsame task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched\nthem. This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to\navoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each\nmovie. As a resource available for download, we offer an extension to the\nMovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new evaluation objectives. Our primary\nobjective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching,\ni.e. predict their watchlist. To construct this extension, we recruited\nMovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse\nset of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the\npools. Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of\nevaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total\nnumber of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation\nruns we used to build the pools. In contrast, when we rank the runs by users'\ninterest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a\nrecommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs. It appears\nthat by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate\nthe popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness\nmeasures for the evaluation of recommender systems.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-02T16:15:46Z"}

(2024a) computed the\nLMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that\nthe LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly\ncounter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of\n$\\Omega_p = -1.0 \\pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar\npattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal\nfinite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results:\nIn the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like\ngalaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that\nsuffers a slowdown from $\\Omega_p \\sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\\Omega_p \\sim 0$\nkm/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\\Omega_p \\sim\n3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before\ninteraction) pattern speed of $\\Omega_p \\sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the\nK21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct\nevidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal\ninteraction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a\nnon-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed\nslow-rotating bars.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-02T16:24:01Z"}

Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling\noffer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON\nlacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative\nAgent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate\nevaluation and selection guided by a verifier.

However, optimizing directly such a\nrate-distortion trade-off requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding,\nand feature evaluation for each coding parameter, which is computationally\nimpractical.

UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and\ndomain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but\nalso paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this\nframework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed\nto tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs\nLLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity,\nwhile leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and\nedge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing\nbaselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\\% and 17.47\\% in ideal and sparse\nsettings, respectively.

In this\nD$^0$-meson-tagged jet measurement, three jet axis definitions, each with\ndifferent sensitivities to soft, wide-angle radiation, are used: the Standard\naxis, Soft Drop groomed axis, and Winner-Takes-All axis. Measurements of the\nradial distributions of D$^0$ mesons with respect to the jet axes, $\\Delta\nR_{\\mathrm{axis-D^0}}$, are reported, along with the angle, $\\Delta\nR_{\\mathrm{axis}}$, between the three jet axes. The D$^{0}$ meson emerges as\nthe leading particle in these jets, closely aligning with the Winner-Takes-All\naxis and diverging from the Standard jet axis. The results also examine how\nvarying the sensitivity to soft radiation with grooming influences the\norientation of the Soft Drop jet axis, and uncover that charm-jet structure is\nmore likely to survive grooming when the Soft Drop axis is further from the\nD$^{0}$ direction, providing further evidence of the dead-cone effect recently\nmeasured by ALICE.","main_category":"hep-ex","categories":"hep-ex,nucl-ex","published":"2025-04-03T13:37:15Z"}

In particular, the $\\rm{H_2}$-dominated atmosphere following an\nocean-vaporising impact is considered favourable to prebiotic molecule\nformation. We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early\nEarth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting\nionisation rates, $\\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period\nwhen the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR\ntransport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a\nfunction of altitude. We calculate $\\zeta$ and the ion-pair production rate,\n$Q$, as a function of altitude due to Galactic and solar CR. The Galactic and\nsolar CR spectra are both affected by the Sun's rotation rate, $\\Omega$,\nbecause the solar wind velocity and magnetic field strength both depend on\n$\\Omega$ and influence CR transport. We consider a range of input spectra\nresulting from the range of possible $\\Omega$, from $3.5-15\\,\n\\Omega_{\\rm{\\odot}}$. To account for the possibility that the Galactic CR\nspectrum outside the Solar System varies over Gyr timescales, we compare\ntop-of-atmosphere $\\zeta$ resulting from two different scenarios. We also\nconsider the suppression of the CR spectra by a planetary magnetic field. We\nfind that $\\zeta$ and $Q$ due to CR are dominated by solar CR in the early\nEarth atmosphere for most cases. The corresponding $\\zeta$ at the early Earth's\nsurface ranges from $5 \\times 10^{-21}\\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\\Omega =\n3.5\\,\\Omega_{\\rm{\\odot}}$ to $1 \\times 10^{-16}\\rm{s^{-1}}$ for $\\Omega =\n15\\,\\Omega_{\\rm{\\odot}}$.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous,\nrealistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions\namong individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain\nspatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map,\nappearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to\ncrowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the\ntimeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents'\ntype, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd\nsimulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it\ncan augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall\nframework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by\nalternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the\ncomponents in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose\na benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated\ncrowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level\ntrajectory accuracy.

The rationale for employing the concept of radial epiderivatives is\nthat they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for both identifying\nglobal descent directions and achieving global minimum of nonconvex and\nnondifferentiable functions. These properties of radial epiderivatives are\ncombined with line search methods to develop iterative solution algorithms. The\nproposed methods generate search directions at each iteration where global\ndescent directions and stopping criteria are performed by using the abilities\nof the radial epiderivatives. We use two line search methods, that is cyclic\ncoordinate and particle swarm optimization techniques to generate search\ndirections, selecting only those that exhibit descent, as determined by using\napproximately computed radial epiderivatives at the current point. As a\nparticular case, these methods are applied for minimizing concave functions. In\nthe paper, two convergence theorems are proved. One of them deals with the\ngeneral line search method and covers only the set of directions generated by\nthe method. The second convergence theorem deals with minimizing concave\nfunctions which deals not only with the generated set of directions but covers\nthe whole set of feasible solutions. The performance of the proposed method is\nevaluated by using well-known benchmark problems from the literature. The\nresults demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in generating\noptimal or near-optimal solutions.","main_category":"math.OC","categories":"math.OC","published":"2025-04-07T13:59:59Z"}

Traditional\nfederated edge computing (EC) methods require frequent central communication,\nconsuming substantial energy and struggling with resource heterogeneity across\ndevices, networks, and data.

However, limited attention has been given to the\ninterpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In\naddition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their\nown homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered,\nand an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering\n(IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is\nfully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples\nare grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors\nof all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the\nclusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making\nprocess of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices\nare introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by\ncapturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different\nstyles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data\nrepresentation capability.

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle\nmultiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential.\nHowever, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather\nconditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world\ndegradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with\ndegradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed\nDA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive\ndegradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration.\nSpecifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware\nrepresentations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space.\nBy aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each\nprompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The\nlearned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed\nweather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple\nweather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather\ndegradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a\ndynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of\nrestoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion\nmodel to restore diverse degradations adaptively.

MioHint\naddresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs. We retrieve\nrelevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including\ndef-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for\nsubfunctions called by the target.\n  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across\n16 real-world REST API services.

Distilling Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has\nemerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing\ncomputational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation\nmethods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as\nspecialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g.,\ncommon neighbors).

It regulates concurrent access to database data by following a\nspecific sequence of acquiring and releasing locks during transaction\nexecution, thereby ensuring transaction isolation. However, in strict 2PL,\ntransactions must wait for conflicting transactions to commit and release their\nlocks, which reduces concurrency and system throughput. We have observed this\nissue is exacerbated in high-contented workloads at Tencent, where lock\ncontention can severely degrade system performance. While existing\noptimizations demonstrate some effectiveness in high-contention scenarios,\ntheir performance remains insufficient, as they suffer from lock contention and\nwaiting in hotspot access.\n  This paper presents optimizations in lock management implemented in Tencent's\ndatabase, TXSQL, with a particular focus on high-contention scenarios. First,\nwe discuss our motivations and the journey toward general lock optimization,\nwhich includes lightweight lock management, a copy-free active transaction\nlist, and queue locking mechanisms that effectively enhance concurrency.\nSecond, we introduce a hotspot-aware approach that enables certain highly\nconflicting transactions to switch to a group locking method, which groups\nconflicting transactions at a specific hotspot, allowing them to execute\nserially in an uncommitted state within a conflict group without the need for\nlocking, thereby reducing lock contention. Our evaluation shows that under\nhigh-contented workloads, TXSQL achieves performance improvements of up to 6.5x\nand up to 22.3x compared to state-of-the-art methods and systems, respectively.","main_category":"cs.DB","categories":"cs.DB","published":"2025-04-09T13:07:22Z"}

The\nantikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson\ncondensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms\nbetween antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we aim to determine hadron\ncouplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three\nkey parameters we calculate $\\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet\nmeson $\\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to\nsinglet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric\nand antisymmetric couplings $\\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its\nimpact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon\ninteractions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson\nfamily and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring\nantikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense\nmatter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\\alpha_v$,\nwhich delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum\nachievable mass of neutron stars. This establishes a lower bound for $\\alpha_v$\nthat is consistent with the observed minimum masses of pulsars.","main_category":"nucl-th","categories":"nucl-th,hep-ph","published":"2025-04-09T13:10:37Z"}

By adjusting the frequencies of nodes in a specific\norder dictated by this tree, and employing a pulsed feedback controller that\ntargets the buffer occupancy of edges within the spanning tree, we prove that\nall elastic buffers in the network can be driven to their desired equilibrium.\nThis ordered adjustment approach ensures that prior centering efforts are not\ndisrupted, providing a robust mechanism for managing buffer occupancy in\nbittide synchronized systems.","main_category":"cs.DC","categories":"cs.DC","published":"2025-04-09T17:02:27Z"}

We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which\nattackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error\nprofile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial\nsystems.\n  We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently\nruns with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we\npropose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by\nrunning programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of\ntrials.

This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud\nadjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also\ntemporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar\nheating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited.\nHere, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the\ncloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted\nclouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to\nautomatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud\nadjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended\nnighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast,\nliquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally\ndecrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most\nof these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from\ndifferences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud\nfraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1\nto -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal\nvariations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may\npartially offset it.

One way to mitigate this challenge is through\noptimizations such as caching and reusing solver results.

However, these\nmethods either have a fixed receptive field for local learning or significant\ncomputational burdens for global learning, limiting the super-resolution\nperformance. To solve this problem, State Space Models, notably Mamba, is\nintroduced to efficiently model long-range dependencies in images with linear\ncomputational complexity. Relying on the Mamba and the fact that low-resolution\nimages rely on global information to compensate for missing details, while\nhigh-resolution reference images need to provide more local details for\naccurate super-resolution, we propose a global and local Mamba network\n(GLMamba) for multi-modality medical image super-resolution. To be specific,\nour GLMamba is a two-branch network equipped with a global Mamba branch and a\nlocal Mamba branch. The global Mamba branch captures long-range relationships\nin low-resolution inputs, and the local Mamba branch focuses more on\nshort-range details in high-resolution reference images. We also use the deform\nblock to adaptively extract features of both branches to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. A modulator is designed to further enhance deformable\nfeatures in both global and local Mamba blocks. To fully integrate the\nreference image for low-resolution image super-resolution, we further develop a\nmulti-modality feature fusion block to adaptively fuse features by considering\nsimilarities, differences, and complementary aspects between modalities. In\naddition, a contrastive edge loss (CELoss) is developed for sufficient\nenhancement of edge textures and contrast in medical images.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-14T11:14:24Z"}

Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE\nsystem via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the\ntask of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function\n$f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which\nrequires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and\nnecessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that\nencodes $f(x)$. This construction can be highly complex, even for simple\nfunctions like $f(x) = x$.

The two-loop $\\beta$-functions are\nfound to be capable of satisfying the vacuum stability up to the Planck scale.\nOn the other hand, only up to $10^{12}$ GeV can the perturbative unitarity be\nsatisfied because of the increase in the positive influence from triplet\ndegrees of freedom. For the strongly electroweak first-order phase transition,\nthe parameter space permitted by the Planck scale stability is examined.\nBecause the triplet degrees of freedom contribute sufficiently to the cubic\nterm, the model satisfies the strongly first order phase transition for the\ntriplet bare mass parameters up to the TeV scale.

While recent\nmethods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on\ngeometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from\nthe point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation\nfor 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images,\nleading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for\nestimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method\ncombines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified\nnetwork to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets,\nand NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted\nclass based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part.\nFinally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to\nrecover its final pose and size.

Under circular scanning mode, such artifacts\nmanifest as concentric rings radiating from the center of rotation, severely\ndegrading image quality. In the Radon transform domain, even if the object's\ndensity function is piecewise discontinuous in certain regions, the projection\nimages remain nearly continuous in the angular direction, making the ideal\nprojections exhibit a smooth global low-frequency characteristic. In practical\nscanning, the local disturbances of the same detector unit at different\nscanning angles lead to a prominent high-frequency locality of stripe\nartifacts. Existing studies generally model ring artifacts disturbances as\nfixed additive errors, which overlooks the dynamic variation of detector\nresponses during practical scanning.

To address this gap, we propose a novel\nframework, DeftRec, which incorporates \\textbf{de}noising di\\textbf{f}fusion\nmodels to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous\n\\textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with\na masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and\nitems, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous\ntokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user\npreferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from\npre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate\nthe objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive\nunderstanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation\ngeneration. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be\neasily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec\nsurpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging\nLLM-based RecSys.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-16T12:01:03Z"}

Existing countermeasures against such ISAJ\nadversaries are laid under the assumption that the adversary does not have the\nknowledge of the countermeasure.

On testing the security of\nexisting countermeasures, we observe that they violate Kerchoffs' principle,\nthus motivating the need for new countermeasures. In this regard, we propose a\nnovel network-centric countermeasure against ISAJ adversaries, wherein a group\nof users in the network assist the victim to reliably communicate her messages\nin a covert manner.

However, practical implementations often\nrequire better error-correction performance than what SC decoding provides,\nparticularly at short to moderate code lengths. Successive-cancellation flip\n(SCF) decoding algorithm was proposed to improve error-correction performance\nwith an aim to detect and correct the first wrongly estimated bit in a codeword\nbefore resuming SC decoding. At each additional SC decoding trial, i.e.,\ndecoding attempt beyond the initial unsuccessful trial, one bit estimated as\nthe least reliable is flipped. Dynamic SCF (DSCF) is a variation of SCF, where\nmultiple bits may be flipped simultaneously per trial. Despite the improved\nerror-correction performance compared to the SC decoder, SCF-based decoders\nhave variable execution time, which leads to high average execution time and\nlatency.

However, it\nis not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the\nmurmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina\n[32] for modular forms of weight 2 (of which elliptic curves form a thin\nsubset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been\nobtained in further work [6,23]. Each of these works gives an explicit formula\nfor the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic\ncurves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged\nover $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration\ndensity in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions.\nThis conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum\nthe $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth\nweight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up\nto $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using\nthe Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different\nfamilies of $L$-functions.

It is clear that the feasibility of this\nconcept will require a significant design and testing effort, performed first\non ground and later in orbit. Plasma simulation tools play a fundamental role\nin the development of this technology, for two main reasons: (i) they can\npotentially increase dramatically the optimization and testing process of ABEP\nsystems, since on-ground testing and in-orbit demonstrators are costly and time\nconsuming, and (ii) the fidelity of on-ground testing is limited by the finite\nsize and pumping speed of high-vacuum facilities, as well as the means through\nwhich the orbital flow is produced.

The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking\nmethods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution\ndiscontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers,\nfunctioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of\n$r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual\nwith respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the\ngrid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are\nproposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render\nstabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and\nmodifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is\nused to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1)\nlessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers,\n(2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with\nthe given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a\nmajority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization.

Our models, DianJin-R1-7B and DianJin-R1-32B, are fine-tuned from\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using a structured format that\ngenerates both reasoning steps and final answers. To further refine reasoning\nquality, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement\nlearning method that incorporates dual reward signals: one encouraging\nstructured outputs and another rewarding answer correctness. We evaluate our\nmodels on five benchmarks: three financial datasets (CFLUE, FinQA, and CCC) and\ntwo general reasoning benchmarks (MATH-500 and GPQA-Diamond). Experimental\nresults show that DianJin-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning\ncounterparts, especially on complex financial tasks.

Since\nworkers are typically unwilling to provide training services/models freely and\nvoluntarily, many incentive mechanisms in FL are designed to incentivize\nparticipation by offering monetary rewards from requesters. However, existing\nstudies neglect two crucial aspects of real-world FL scenarios. First, workers\ncan possess inherent incompatibility characteristics (e.g., communication\nchannels and data sources), which can lead to degradation of FL efficiency\n(e.g., low communication efficiency and poor model generalization). Second, the\nrequesters are budgeted, which limits the amount of workers they can hire for\ntheir tasks. In this paper, we investigate the scenario in FL where multiple\nbudgeted requesters seek training services from incompatible workers with\nprivate training costs. We consider two settings: the cooperative budget\nsetting where requesters cooperate to pool their budgets to improve their\noverall utility and the non-cooperative budget setting where each requester\noptimizes their utility within their own budgets. To address efficiency\ndegradation caused by worker incompatibility, we develop novel\ncompatibility-aware incentive mechanisms, CARE-CO and CARE-NO, for both\nsettings to elicit true private costs and determine workers to hire for\nrequesters and their rewards while satisfying requester budget constraints.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with\nrandom linear network coding (RLNC) is designed for data transmission, where\nNOMA allows the serving of multiple users simultaneously through controlling\nthe power domain, and RLNC helps minimize errors that might occur during signal\nprocessing phase.

In recent years, due to the increased\nresolution of observations and the need to resolve non-force-free lower regions\nof the solar atmosphere, there have been increased efforts to use\nmagnetohydrostatic (MHS) field models instead of force-free extrapolation\nmethods. Although numerical methods to calculateMHS solutions can deal with\nnon-linear problems and hence provide more accurate models, analytical\nthree-dimensional MHS equilibria can also be used as a numerically relatively\n\"cheap\" complementary method. In this paper, we present an extrapolation method\nbased on a family of analytical MHS equilibria that allows for a transition\nfrom a non-force-free region to a force-free region.

Self-supervised representation learning methods\nsuch as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very\nsuccessful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image\ndata, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for\ndownstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance\nas they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to\nimplement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the\nstrength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called\nthe Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we\nconvert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise\ncomparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information\nformulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse.

In contrast, hard-constraint\nmethods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation\ntimes.\n  To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS\nGlobal Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in\nspatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D\nenvironment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of\nexploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when\npotential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected.

However, most approaches are designed for\nspecific tasks, restricting their generalizability to combine different types\nof condition. Developing a unified framework for image customization remains an\nopen challenge. In this paper, we present DreamO, an image customization\nframework designed to support a wide range of tasks while facilitating seamless\nintegration of multiple conditions. Specifically, DreamO utilizes a diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) framework to uniformly process input of different types.\nDuring training, we construct a large-scale training dataset that includes\nvarious customization tasks, and we introduce a feature routing constraint to\nfacilitate the precise querying of relevant information from reference images.\nAdditionally, we design a placeholder strategy that associates specific\nplaceholders with conditions at particular positions, enabling control over the\nplacement of conditions in the generated results. Moreover, we employ a\nprogressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage\nfocused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a\nfull-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization\ncapabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases\nintroduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with\nhigh quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-23T17:41:44Z"}

The\nreliability of journeys involving transfers is affected by the reliability of\nthe transfers and the consequences of missing a transfer, as well as the\npossible delay of the train used to reach the destination. In this paper, we\npropose a flexible method to model the reliability of train journeys with any\nnumber of transfers. The method combines a transfer reliability model based on\ngradient boosting responsible for predicting the reliability of transfers\nbetween trains and a delay model based on probabilistic Bayesian regression,\nwhich is used to model train arrival delays. The models are trained on delay\ndata from four Swedish train stations and evaluated on delay data from another\ntwo stations, in order to evaluate the generalization performance of the\nmodels. We show that the probabilistic delay model, which models train delays\nfollowing a mixture distribution with two lognormal components, allows to much\nmore realistically model the distribution of actual train delays compared to a\nstandard lognormal model. Finally, we show how these models can be used\ntogether to sample the arrival delay at the final destination of the entire\njourney. The results indicate that the method accurately predicts the\nreliability for nine out of ten tested journeys. The method could be used to\nimprove journey planners by providing reliability information to travelers.\nFurther applications include timetable planning and transport modeling.","main_category":"stat.AP","categories":"stat.AP","published":"2025-04-24T12:13:55Z"}
