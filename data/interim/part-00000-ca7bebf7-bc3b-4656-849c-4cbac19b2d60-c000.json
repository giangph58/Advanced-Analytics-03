While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.

Predictive trajectory\nplanning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input.\nUnder noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary\nsignificantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome\nthis issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm\nwith a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference\ntrajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target\nreference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning\nalgorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus\nimplicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is\nassessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype\nvehicle.

We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of any\nLie-Poisson algebra (linear Poisson algebra) on the algebraic variety defined\nby its Casimir polynomials. The Lie algebra that gives weak matrix\nregularization is not necessarily semisimple. Casimir polynomials correspond\nwith Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization.

CHRONOS is\nincremental and avoids constructing a start-ordered serialization graph for the\nentire history, making it well-suited for online scenarios. We further extend\nCHRONOS into an online SI checker, AION, addressing several key challenges\nunique to online settings. Additionally, we develop AION-SER for online SER\nchecking. Experiments highlight that CHRONOS processes offline histories with\nup to one million transactions in seconds, greatly outperforming existing SI\ncheckers. Furthermore, AION and AION-SER sustain a throughput of approximately\n12K transactions per second, demonstrating their practicality for online\nisolation checking.","main_category":"cs.DB","categories":"cs.DB","published":"2025-04-02T08:30:48Z"}

However, it often requires large annotated training datasets,\nwhich limits its scalability in clinical settings. To address this challenge,\nsemi-supervised learning is a well-established approach that leverages both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised\nteacher-student framework for biomedical image segmentation, inspired by the\nrecent success of generative models. Our approach leverages denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate segmentation masks by progressively\nrefining noisy inputs conditioned on the corresponding images. The teacher\nmodel is first trained in an unsupervised manner using a cycle-consistency\nconstraint based on noise-corrupted image reconstruction, enabling it to\ngenerate informative semantic masks. Subsequently, the teacher is integrated\ninto a co-training process with a twin-student network. The student learns from\nground-truth labels when available and from teacher-generated pseudo-labels\notherwise, while the teacher continuously improves its pseudo-labeling\ncapabilities. Finally, to further enhance performance, we introduce a\nmulti-round pseudo-label generation strategy that iteratively improves the\npseudo-labeling process.

As\none of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently\nsequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and\napplicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel\nimplementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand\nadditional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to\nonly modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a\ntransformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware\nco-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices.\nIt facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems\nshow an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\\times$ and 27$\\times$ per\niteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC)\nframework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\\times$ for the cart-pole\nand 17.8$\\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional\niLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance,\nachieving up to 27.3$\\times$ speedup over commonly used computing devices, with\naround 2 to 4$\\times$ power reduction and acceptable hardware overhead.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY","published":"2025-04-02T15:12:18Z"}

However, biased T2I\nmodels can generate content with specific tendencies, potentially influencing\npeople's perceptions. Intentional exploitation of these biases risks conveying\nmisleading information to the public. Current research on bias primarily\naddresses explicit biases with recognizable visual patterns, such as skin color\nand gender. This paper introduces a novel form of implicit bias that lacks\nexplicit visual features but can manifest in diverse ways across various\nsemantic contexts. This subtle and versatile nature makes this bias challenging\nto detect, easy to propagate, and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. We\nfurther propose an implicit bias injection attack framework (IBI-Attacks)\nagainst T2I diffusion models by precomputing a general bias direction in the\nprompt embedding space and adaptively adjusting it based on different inputs.\nOur attack module can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion\nmodels in a plug-and-play manner without direct manipulation of user input or\nmodel retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our\nscheme in introducing bias through subtle and diverse modifications while\npreserving the original semantics.

Assisted by the dynamic and reversible supramolecular interactions, it\nis envisaged that SBC self-assemblies may exhibit more diverse morphologies,\nstimuli-responsivity comparing to their covalent analogues. At the fundamental\nlevel, these features are related to the free-energy landscape of\nself-assemblies. It is therefore of central importance to understand the impact\nof dynamic/reversible bonds on the free energy landscape during structure\ntransitions. In this study, we first conduct smart Monte Carlo simulations to\ncompare the kinetics of the disorder-order transition (DOT) of supramolecular\ndiblock copolymers (SDBC) to that of covalent diblock copolymers (CDBC). The\nstructural order parameter for CDBC exhibits a fast and smooth transition\nprocess across different random number seeds and initial configurations. In\ncontrast, the SDBC system shows more diverse transition pathways, which can be\nclassified into three types. These results suggest that reversible\nsupramolecular interactions complicate the pathways, and bring about various\nintermediate structures. Next, we apply the string method to construct the\nminimum free energy path of the transition, from which the transition state and\nthe free energy barrier are evaluated.

Drawing from these insights, we propose\nGenerative Classifier-driven Domain Generalization (GCDG), introducing a\ngenerative paradigm for the DG classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) for each class across domains. GCDG consists of three key modules:\nHeterogeneity Learning Classifier~(HLC), Spurious Correlation Blocking~(SCB),\nand Diverse Component Balancing~(DCB). Concretely, HLC attempts to model the\nfeature distributions and thereby capture valuable domain-specific information\nvia GMMs. SCB identifies the neural units containing spurious correlations and\nperturbs them, mitigating the risk of HLC learning spurious patterns.\nMeanwhile, DCB ensures a balanced contribution of components in HLC, preventing\nthe underestimation or neglect of critical components. In this way, GCDG excels\nin capturing the nuances of domain-specific information characterized by\ndiverse distributions. GCDG demonstrates the potential to reduce the target\nrisk and encourage flat minima, improving the generalizability. Extensive\nexperiments show GCDG's comparable performance on five DG benchmarks and one\nface anti-spoofing dataset, seamlessly integrating into existing DG methods\nwith consistent improvements.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-03T04:38:33Z"}

Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process\nand a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where\nindependent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply\ncontrolling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a\nforward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator.

While the dynamics associated with these\nattractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered\nclass of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions,\nseparated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic,\nbeyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real\nfixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed\npoint itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in\nnongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment\nof straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic\nattractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor,\nwhich may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the\nexistence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with\ndifferent types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of\ndiscontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to\nthe appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the\nthree-dimensional space.

However, they still remain the threat of jailbreak\nattacks, where attackers manipulate designed prompts to make the models elicit\nmalicious outputs. Analyzing jailbreak methods can help us delve into the\nweakness of LLMs and improve it. In this paper, We reveal a vulnerability in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which we term Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), by\nanalyzing the attention weights of the model's output on input and subsequent\noutput on prior output: as the model generates substantial benign content, its\nattention weights shift from the input to prior output, making it more\nsusceptible to jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we\npropose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which\ninduces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input\nand adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To\nmitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy,\nPOSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the\nmodel's generalization capabilities.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-08T03:57:09Z"}

A typical recommender system handling multiple types\nof feedback has two components: a multi-task learning (MTL) module, predicting\nfeedback such as click-through rate and like rate; and a multi-task fusion\n(MTF) module, integrating these predictions into a single score for item\nranking. MTF is essential for ensuring user satisfaction, as it directly\ninfluences recommendation outcomes. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has\nbeen applied to MTF tasks to improve long-term user satisfaction. However,\nexisting RL-based MTF methods are formula-based methods, which only adjust\nlimited coefficients within pre-defined formulas. The pre-defined formulas\nrestrict the RL search space and become a bottleneck for MTF. To overcome this,\nwe propose a formula-free MTF framework. We demonstrate that any suitable\nfusion function can be expressed as a composition of single-variable monotonic\nfunctions, as per the Sprecher Representation Theorem. Leveraging this, we\nintroduce a novel learnable monotonic fusion cell (MFC) to replace pre-defined\nformulas. We call this new MFC-based model eXtreme MTF (xMTF).

One of the key assumptions of the model is that the `atom' is a\nperfect two-level system. We explore what happens when one generalizes the atom\nto a multilevel system, with $m$ ground and $n$ excited states coupled to the\nsame field. We focus on the case where the excited and ground states form\ndistinct, well-separated, manifolds of near-degenerate levels (so that the\nspacing between the excited states on a given manifold is much less than the\naverage spacing between the manifolds) and consider either uniform or random\ncouplings between the individual ground and excited levels. We find that the\nsystem reduces approximately to a direct sum of Rabi models with a range of\ndifferent couplings. Importantly, the strongest coupling is enhanced in a way\nthat depends on the number of levels, for the simple case where $n=m$, the\ncoupling scales with $n$ for uniform couplings and $2\\sqrt{n}$ for random\ncouplings (in the limit of large $n$). Our work thus suggests that multilevel\nRabi systems could provide an attractive alternative route to accessing regimes\nof very strong coupling in light-matter systems.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-08T11:10:19Z"}

Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm\nmanipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the\nsystem changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor\nUAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external\ndisturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to\nunforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear\nadaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on\nDNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic\nand dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator.

The existence of this filament is confirmed through $^{13}$CO and\nNH$_3$ molecular line data in a velocity range of [95, 106] km s$^{-1}$.

A\nconsensus performing CT imaging is to make the radiation dose as low as\nreasonably achievable, i.e. the ALARA law. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end learning framework, named End2end-ALARA, that jointly optimizes dose\nmodulation and image reconstruction to meet the goal of ALARA in CT imaging.\nEnd2end-ALARA works by building a dose modulation module and an image\nreconstruction module, connecting these modules with a differentiable\nsimulation function, and optimizing the them with a constrained hinge loss\nfunction. The objective is to minimize radiation dose subject to a prescribed\nimage quality (IQ) index.

Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often\nsuboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the\nembedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising\nfast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a\nfew steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any\nperformance drop during the adaptation process.

This approach relies on the core assumption\nthat the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an\nidentical concept.

Prior\nmethods, such as Encodec, typically encode individual audio frames into\ndiscrete tokens without considering the use of context information across\nframes. Unlike these methods, we introduce a novel query-based compression\nstrategy to capture holistic information with a set of learnable query tokens\nby explicitly modeling the context information across frames. This design not\nonly enables the codec model to capture more semantic information but also\nencodes the audio signal with fewer token sequences. Additionally, to enhance\nthe semantic information in audio codec models, we introduce the following: (1)\nA masked autoencoder (MAE) loss, (2) Vector quantization based on semantic\npriors, and (3) An autoregressive (AR) prediction loss. As a result,\nALMTokenizer achieves competitive reconstruction performance relative to\nstate-of-the-art approaches while operating at a lower bitrate. Within the same\naudio language model framework, ALMTokenizer outperforms previous tokenizers in\naudio understanding and generation tasks.","main_category":"cs.SD","categories":"cs.SD","published":"2025-04-14T15:51:56Z"}

Texture\nclassification is a key component of computer vision systems that enable\nreal-time monitoring and adjustment during cementitious fabrication.\nTraditional classification methods often rely on global image features, which\ncan bias the model toward semantic content rather than low-level textures. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel preprocessing technique called \"patch and\nshuffle,\" which segments input images into smaller patches, shuffles them, and\nreconstructs a jumbled image before classification. This transformation removes\nsemantic context, forcing the classifier to rely on local texture features.\n  We evaluate this approach on a dataset of extruded cement images, using a\nResNet-18-based architecture. Our experiments compare the patch and shuffle\nmethod to a standard pipeline, holding all other factors constant. Results show\na significant improvement in accuracy: the patch and shuffle model achieved\n90.64% test accuracy versus 72.46% for the baseline. These findings suggest\nthat disrupting global structure enhances performance in texture-based\nclassification tasks.\n  This method has implications for broader vision tasks where low-level\nfeatures matter more than high-level semantics.

While there\nis ongoing research on enabling camera calibration using natural images, many\nsystems in practice still rely on using designated calibration targets with\ne.g. checkerboard patterns or April tag grids. Once calibration images from\ndifferent perspectives have been acquired and feature descriptors detected,\nthose are typically used in an optimization process to minimize the geometric\nreprojection error. For this optimization to converge, input images need to be\nof sufficient quality and particularly sharpness; they should neither contain\nmotion blur nor rolling-shutter artifacts that can arise when the calibration\nboard was not static during image capture. In this work, we present a novel\ncalibration image acquisition technique controlled via voice commands recorded\nwith a clip-on microphone, that can be more robust and user-friendly than e.g.\ntriggering capture with a remote control, or filtering out blurry frames from a\nvideo sequence in postprocessing. To achieve this, we use a state-of-the-art\nspeech-to-text transcription model with accurate per-word timestamping to\ncapture trigger words with precise temporal alignment. Our experiments show\nthat the proposed method improves user experience by being fast and efficient,\nallowing us to successfully calibrate complex multi-camera setups.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.CV","published":"2025-04-15T09:54:43Z"}

This is one of the\nreasons for the large discrepancy between the experimental estimate of the\ncavitation threshold and the theory's predictions.\n  Our investigation aims to identify nucleation thresholds in various\nsubstances characterized by different physical properties. The experiments were\nperformed by initiating nucleation through ultrasound at 24 kHz. The cavitation\nonset was studied using a novel procedure based on high-speed imaging and\nacoustic measurements with a hydrophone.

We demonstrate that sequential\nidentifiability, combined with a standard Kullback--Leibler prior support\ncondition, is sufficient to ensure posterior consistency.

This allowed us to derive a set of physical properties\nfor SN~2023pel.

Therefore, to achieve high-precision landing, this note proposes a\nnovel online trajectory dispersion control method. Based on a Parameterized\nOptimal Feedback Guidance Law (POFGL), two key components of the proposed\nmethod are designed: online trajectory dispersion prediction and real-time\nguidance parameter tuning for trajectory dispersion optimization. First, by\nformalizing a parameterized probabilistic disturbance model, the closed-loop\ntrajectory dispersion under the POFGL is predicted online. Compared with the\ncovariance control guidance method, a more accurate trajectory dispersion\nprediction is achieved by using generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion\nand pseudospectral collocation methods.

The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the\nEarth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary\nembryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the\ncircum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the\nimpactor, contradicting with the fact that different Solar System bodies have\ndistinct compositions. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining\nthe Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the\nproto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a\nslightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid\nrotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of\nthe current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth\nhit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface\nof the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow\nrotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of\nangular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation.\nHere, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential\nrotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow\nrotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with\nmaterials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular\nmomentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of\nexplaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-16T14:34:51Z"}

After\ntraining on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches\nstate-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on\nboth in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.\nEmbodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis\nand contextual integration. We further explore research questions including\nresponse length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences\nin model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CV","published":"2025-04-17T06:16:11Z"}

While CLIP demonstrates\nremarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature\nspaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text\nfeature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing\nworks attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or\nfine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or\ndegradations of zero-shot performance.

This fact is\nvery important for the application of the spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum.\nIn fact, let $T$ denote a (right) linear Clifford operator, the $S$-spectrum is\nassociated with a second-order polynomial in the operator $T$, specifically the\noperator defined as $ Q_s(T) := T^2 - 2s_0T + |s|^2. $ This allows us to\nassociate to the Dirac operator boundary conditions that can be of Dirichlet\ntype but also of Robin-like type.

However,\nprior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their\nclaimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an\nefficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly\nsensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a\nhybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context\nwindows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the\noptimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and\ndataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LLMs to\ngenerate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to\nestimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our\nresults on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of\nour method across model classes and sizes.

In such complex contexts, the increasing\npattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based\napproaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share\ncompositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high\nfidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2)\ninsufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as\nintricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully\nreconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting\nin false positives.

Calibration suffices to\nguarantee that simple best-response to predictions is optimal. However,\ncalibration for high-dimensional prediction outcome spaces requires exponential\ncomputational and statistical complexity. The recent relaxation known as\ndecision calibration ensures the optimality of the simple best-response rule\nwhile requiring only polynomial sample complexity in the dimension of outcomes.\nHowever, known results on calibration and decision calibration crucially rely\non linear loss functions for establishing best-response optimality. A natural\napproach to handle nonlinear losses is to map outcomes $y$ into a feature space\n$\\phi(y)$ of dimension $m$, then approximate losses with linear functions of\n$\\phi(y)$. Unfortunately, even simple classes of nonlinear functions can demand\nexponentially large or infinite feature dimensions $m$. A key open problem is\nwhether it is possible to achieve decision calibration with sample complexity\nindependent of~$m$.

Motivated by this lower bound, we\ninvestigate a smooth version of decision calibration in which decision-makers\nfollow a smooth best-response. This smooth relaxation enables dimension-free\ndecision calibration algorithms. We introduce algorithms that, given\n$\\mathrm{poly}(|A|,1/\\epsilon)$ samples and any initial predictor~$p$, can\nefficiently post-process it to satisfy decision calibration without worsening\naccuracy.

Such methods use various spatial\nproperties of the observed data to infer its local and global behaviour. In\nthis study, we exploit the adaptability of locally interacting systems from\nstatistical physics and develop an interpolation framework for numerical\ngeoscientific data called Interacting Immediate Neighbour Interpolation (IINI),\nwhich solely relies on local and immediate neighbour correlations. In the IINI\nmethod, medium-to-long range correlations are constructed from the collective\nlocal interactions of grid centroids. To demonstrate the functionality and\nstrengths of IINI, we apply our methodology to the interpolation of ground\ngravity, airborne magnetic and airborne radiometric datasets. We further\ncompare the performance of IINI to conventional methods such as minimum\ncurvature surface fitting. Results show that IINI is competitive with\nconventional interpolation techniques in terms of validation accuracy, while\nbeing significantly simpler in terms of algorithmic complexity and data\npre-processing requirements. IINI demonstrates the broader applicability of\nstatistical physics concepts within the field of geostatistics, highlighting\ntheir potential to enrich and expand traditional geostatistical methods.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME,physics.geo-ph","published":"2025-04-22T10:45:58Z"}

The main obstacle\nin using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional\nverification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications\nand code.

A precise multi-dimensional\ndescription of the hadron structure has, in fact, the potential to deepen our\nunderstanding of the strong interactions and to provide a much more precise\nframework for measuring both Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model\nobservables. This ambitious task poses its basis on the recent experience with\nthe successful installation and operation of the SMOG2 unpolarized gas target\nin front of the LHCb spectrometer. Besides allowing for interesting physics\nstudies ranging from astrophysics to heavy-ion physics, SMOG2 provides an ideal\nbenchmark for studying beam-target dynamics at the LHC and demonstrates the\nfeasibility of simultaneous operation with beam-beam collisions. With the\ninstallation of the proposed polarized target system, LHCb will become the\nfirst experiment to simultaneously collect data from unpolarized beam-beam\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV and polarized and unpolarized beam-target\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim$100 GeV.

This process also plays a pivotal\nrole in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs).\nTraditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant\napproach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll\nparameter $\\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period --\nmarking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where\n$\\epsilon_2 \\simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection\npoints or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we\nchallenge the conventional assumption that $\\epsilon_2 \\lesssim -6$ is a\nprerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We\ndemonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can\nindeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth,\nestablishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification.\nConsequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs.\nTo illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is\nembedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying\n$\\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the\namplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs\nproduction, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological\nmissions.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th","published":"2025-04-22T17:36:01Z"}

Previous studies have shown that this exponent is a smooth\nfunction of eigenenergy in the same phase, thus its non-smoothness can serve as\nstrong evidence to determine the phase transition from the extended phase to\nthe localized phase. However, logically, there is no fundamental reason that\nprohibits this Lyapunov exponent from being non-smooth in the localized phase.\nIn this work, we show that if the localization centers are inhomogeneous in the\nwhole chain and if the system possesses (at least) two different localization\nmodes, the Lyapunov exponent can become non-smooth in the localized phase at\nthe boundaries between the different localization modes. We demonstrate these\nresults using several slowly varying models and show that the singularities of\ndensity of states are essential to these non-smoothness, according to the\nThouless formula. These results can be generalized to higher-dimensional\nmodels, suggesting the possible delicate structures in the localized phase,\nwhich can revise our understanding of localization hence greatly advance our\ncomprehension of Anderson localization.","main_category":"cond-mat.dis-nn","categories":"cond-mat.dis-nn","published":"2025-04-23T11:44:44Z"}

The epochs of these two\nsurveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect the\n~3'/year orbital motion of P9. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point\nsource list for our P9 search - AKARI Monthly Unconfirmed Source List, which\nincludes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after\nmonths. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI\ndetections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and\norbital motion of P9 by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature\nto ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and\nflux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the\ncatalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs whose angular\nseparations were limited between 42' and 69.6', corresponding to the\nheliocentric distance range of 500 - 700 AU and the mass range of 7 - 17 Earth\nmasses. There are 13 pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image\ninspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent\nfrom the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa.\nHowever, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit\nof this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations,\nwhich will determine the Keplerian motion of our candidate.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-24T06:28:28Z"}

These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow\npatterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence\nof computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels\nremains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak\nperformance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage\nmodern accelerators.

This\nhas led to intriguing insights regarding the power of private randomness. E.g.,\nfor certain round complexity classes, derandomization does not incur an\noverhead (asymptotically).\n  This work considers a setting where the randomness is public. Recently, an\nLCL problem for which shared randomness can reduce the round complexity was\ndiscovered by Balliu et al. (2024).

We\nintroduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the\ntraining of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE.\nUnlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive\ncommunication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions\namong multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without\nsuch assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once,\nand the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.\n  Silenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to\nmitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel\nlow-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue\nnumber systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that\nno intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit.
