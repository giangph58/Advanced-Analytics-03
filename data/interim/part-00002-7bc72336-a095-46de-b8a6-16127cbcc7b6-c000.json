No significant differences in flame response are identified\nin flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations.\nWe find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in\nparticle loading.

In addition, we observe a lack of\nbenchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate\nmetric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of\ngenerative language models can differ significantly based on the language being\nused. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual\nquestion answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs.\nOur benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an\nimage and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance.\nThe grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the\njudge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By\ndefining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small\nopen-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably.

In addition, a replay mode allows\nusers to examine their previous squats and check their comments. Initially,\nfour primary characteristics of the barbell squat were identified: body joint\nangles, dorsiflexion, the ratio of knee-to-hip movement, and barbell stability.\nMethods: We collect 8,151 squats from 77 participants, categorizing them as\ngood squats and six issues. Then, we trained the diagnosis models with three\nmachine-learning architectures. Furthermore, this research applied the SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance the accuracy of issue prediction\nand reduce the computation time by feature selection. Results: The F1 score of\nthe six issues reached 86.86%, 69.01%, 77.42%, 90.74%, 95.83%, and 100%. Each\nsquat diagnosis took less than 0.5 seconds. Finally, this study examined the\nefficacy of the proposed system with two groups of participants trained with\nand without the system. Subsequently, participants trained with the system\nexhibited substantial improvements in their squat technique, as assessed both\nby the system itself and by a professional weightlifting coach.

The academic and\ntechnical exploration within the VCM domain has led to the development of\nseveral strategies, and yet, conspicuous limitations remain in their\nadaptability for multi-task scenarios. To address the challenge, we propose a\nTransformable Video Feature Compression (TransVFC) framework.

Experiments show that TransVFC achieves high\nrate-task performance for diverse tasks of different granularities.

However, many existing models remain\nconstrained by fixed spatial resolutions and patch sizes, limiting their\nability to fully exploit the heterogeneous spatial characteristics inherent in\nsatellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose FlexiMo, a flexible\nremote sensing foundation model that endows the pre-trained model with the\nflexibility to adapt to arbitrary spatial resolutions. Central to FlexiMo is a\nspatial resolution-aware module that employs a parameter-free alignment\nembedding mechanism to dynamically recalibrate patch embeddings based on the\ninput image's resolution and dimensions. This design not only preserves\ncritical token characteristics and ensures multi-scale feature fidelity but\nalso enables efficient feature extraction without requiring modifications to\nthe underlying network architecture. In addition, FlexiMo incorporates a\nlightweight channel adaptation module that leverages prior spectral information\nfrom sensors. This mechanism allows the model to process images with varying\nnumbers of channels while maintaining the data's intrinsic physical properties.\nExtensive experiments on diverse multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-scale\ndatasets demonstrate that FlexiMo significantly enhances model generalization\nand robustness. In particular, our method achieves outstanding performance\nacross a range of downstream tasks, including scene classification, land cover\nclassification, urban building segmentation, and cloud detection.

The\nphysics of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding\nrequires computationally expensive simulations. The sampling of large, densely\nsampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population\nsynthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present\ncriteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating\nmultiple explodability proxies derived from the stellar structure at the onset\nof core collapse. These are formulated based on the outcomes of a semi-analytic\nsupernova model, evaluated over a set of ~3,900 heterogeneous stellar\nprogenitors (single stars, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the\nexplodabiliy criteria achieve an accuracy of >99% agreement with the\nsemi-analytic model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN\nsimulation outcomes from two different groups. Furthermore, we find that all\nexplodability proxies needed for our pre-SN criteria have two distinct peaks\nand intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass\n$M_\\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively.\nThe CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with\nmetallicity, $Z$, and with the timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal in\nbinary-stripped stars. With these, we identify critical values in\n$M_\\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct\ncollapse. The outcome is a CCSN recipe based on $M_\\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$,\napplicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies.

One such approach is the \"social circle\" question, which asks\nrespondents about the voting preferences of their social contacts. This method\nleverages collective intelligence and has shown promise in improving predictive\naccuracy. Nevertheless, the influence of the social network's topology on the\neffectiveness of social circle polls remains unexplored.

To tackle V2I link deterioration caused by blockage and out-of-coverage\ncases, multi-hop V2X routing with both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and V2I links\nneeds to be investigated. However, traditional routing reacts to statistical or\nreal-time information, which may suffer link degradation during path switchover\nin fast-changing vehicular networks. Predictive routing protocols take timely\nactions by forecasting link connectivity, but they fail to satisfy specific QoS\nrequirements. Low robustness to link failures is also incurred without\nconsidering imperfect prediction. To build continual paths between VUEs and BSs\nfor QoS provision of cloud service, a robust predictive routing framework\n(ROPE) is proposed with three major components: 1) an early warning scheme\ndetects V2I link deterioration in advance via predicting vehicle mobility and\nlink signal strength to facilitate seamless path switchover; 2) a virtual\nrouting mechanism finds top3 paths that have the highest path strength and\nsatisfy the connectivity and hop count constraints based on the prediction\nresults to fulfill QoS requirements of cloud service; 3) a path verification\nprotocol checks availability and quality of the top3 paths shortly before\nswitchover and activates one qualified path for switchover to ensure routing\nrobustness.

Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate the superiority of ROPE over direct V2I communications\nand a connectivity-based predictive routing protocol under various scenarios.","main_category":"cs.NI","categories":"cs.NI","published":"2025-03-31T09:41:16Z"}

Such anomalies can indicate a critical system\nfailure, lead to a groundbreaking scientific discovery, or reveal unexpected\nchanges in data distribution. We introduce EagleEye, an anomaly detection\nmethod to compare two multivariate datasets with the aim of identifying local\ndensity anomalies, namely over- or under-densities affecting only localised\nregions of the feature space. Anomalies are detected by modelling, for each\npoint, the ordered sequence of its neighbours' membership label as a\ncoin-flipping process and monitoring deviations from the expected behaviour of\nsuch process. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to provide an\naccurate, entirely unsupervised estimate of the local signal purity. We\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets. In synthetic data, EagleEye accurately detects anomalies\nin multiple dimensions even when they affect a tiny fraction of the data. When\napplied to a challenging resonant anomaly detection benchmark task in simulated\nLarge Hadron Collider data, EagleEye successfully identifies particle decay\nevents present in just 0.3% of the dataset. In global temperature data,\nEagleEye uncovers previously unidentified, geographically localised changes in\ntemperature fields that occurred in the most recent years.

Inadequate rebalancing results\nin prolonged rider waiting times, inefficient vehicle utilization, and\ninequitable distribution of services, leading to disparities in driver\navailability and income.\n  To tackle these complexities, we introduce scalable continuous-state\nmean-field control (MFC) and reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that\nexplicitly represent each vehicle's precise location and employ continuous\nrepositioning actions guided by the distribution of other vehicles.

Existing works generally focus on collecting\nextensive domain-specific data and directly tuning the original CLIP models.\nIntuitively, such a paradigm takes no full consideration of the characteristics\nlying in domain-specific data (e.g., fine-grained nature of biological data)\nand so limits model capability, while mostly losing the original ability of\nCLIP in the general domain. In this paper, we propose a Distribution\nAlignment-based Language-Image Pre-Training (DALIP) method for biological data.\nSpecifically, DALIP optimizes CLIP models by matching the similarity between\nfeature distribution of image-text pairs instead of the original [cls] token,\nwhich can capture rich yet effective information inherent in image-text pairs\nas powerful representations, and so better cope with fine-grained nature of\nbiological data. Particularly, our DALIP efficiently approximates feature\ndistribution via its first- and second-order statistics, while presenting a\nMulti-head Brownian Distance Covariance (MBDC) module to acquire second-order\nstatistics of token features efficiently. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset\nfor plant domain (e.g., specific data in biological domain) comprising 10M\nplant data with 3M general-domain data (namely PlantMix-13M) according to data\nmixing laws. Extensive experiments show that DALIP clearly outperforms existing\nCLIP counterparts in biological domain, while well generalizing to remote\nsensing and medical imaging domains.

To comprehend egocentric\ninteractions exhaustively, this paper presents a novel task named Egocentric\nInteraction Reasoning and pixel Grounding (Ego-IRG). Taking an egocentric image\nwith the query as input, Ego-IRG is the first task that aims to resolve the\ninteractions through three crucial steps: analyzing, answering, and pixel\ngrounding, which results in fluent textual and fine-grained pixel-level\nresponses. Another challenge is that existing datasets cannot meet the\nconditions for the Ego-IRG task. To address this limitation, this paper creates\nthe Ego-IRGBench dataset based on extensive manual efforts, which includes over\n20k egocentric images with 1.6 million queries and corresponding multimodal\nresponses about interactions. Moreover, we design a unified ANNEXE model to\ngenerate text- and pixel-level outputs utilizing multimodal large language\nmodels, which enables a comprehensive interpretation of egocentric\ninteractions. The experiments on the Ego-IRGBench exhibit the effectiveness of\nour ANNEXE model compared with other works.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-02T08:24:35Z"}

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based\nsystems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby\ngarnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several\nbenchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by\nformalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and\nreasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with\nrelevant retrieved news articles. However, because there is no consideration on\nwhether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting\nrationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently\nnoninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET,\nwhich comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for\nretrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal\nIntervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability\nthrough causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected\nrecent trend forecasting questions and then filtered the data using CIL,\nresulting in an inferable benchmark for event prediction.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that\ntreats conditional image synthesis as the modular combination of diverse\nfundamental condition units. Specifically, we divide conditions into three\nprimary units: text, layout, and drag. To enable effective control over these\nconditions, we design a dedicated alignment module for each. For the text\ncondition, we introduce a Dense Concept Alignment (DCA) module, which achieves\ndense visual-text alignment by drawing on diverse textual concepts.

Recent work has improved the\nstate-of-the-art of APR by fine-tuning pre-trained large language models\n(LLMs), such as CodeT5, for APR. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning\nbecomes weakened in data scarcity scenarios, and data scarcity can be a common\nissue in practice, limiting fine-tuning performance. To alleviate this\nlimitation, this paper adapts prompt tuning for enhanced APR and conducts a\ncomprehensive study to evaluate its effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios,\nusing three LLMs of different sizes and six diverse datasets across four\nprogramming languages. Prompt tuning rewrites the input to a model by adding\nextra prompt tokens and tunes both the model and the prompts on a small\ndataset. These tokens provide task-specific knowledge that can improve the\nmodel for APR, which is especially critical in data scarcity scenarios.\nMoreover, domain knowledge has proven crucial in many code intelligence tasks,\nbut existing studies fail to leverage domain knowledge during the prompt tuning\nfor APR. To close this gap, we introduce knowledge prompt tuning, an approach\nthat adapts prompt tuning with six distinct types of code- or bug-related\ndomain knowledge for APR.

In this work we explore the\nimpact of microphysics on the bulk evolution of discs. The polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, and the extent to which grain growth has occurred\nin the disc have profound effects on the strength of mass loss rates due to\nexternal photoevaporation, which in turn can have a significant impact on the\ndisc evolution, impacting disc radii and accretion rates over time.

These include traditional physical HRI\nmethods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based\nHRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI\nmethods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity,\nsensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and,\nmost importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the\ninteraction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient\nmotivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nnovel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB\nmonocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps:\ndetecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby\napplying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to\ncontrol gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a\nfeasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high\nlatency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a\ngesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\\% and an average system\nresponse time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI. The proposed\nnon-contact HRI method represents a pioneering advancement in control\ninteractions for RLEEX, paving the way for further exploration and development\nin this field.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.HC","published":"2025-04-02T16:46:01Z"}

Previous methods\nfocused on learning continuous features exhibit weak differentiation between\nforeground and background features. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMoment-Quantization based Video Temporal Grounding method (MQVTG), which\nquantizes the input video into various discrete vectors to enhance the\ndiscrimination between relevant and irrelevant moments. Specifically, MQVTG\nmaintains a learnable moment codebook, where each video moment matches a\ncodeword.

We take inspiration from grammatical rule based\ngloss generation used in Germany and American sign langauage (ASL) and adapt it\nfor BdSL. We also leverage LLM to generate synthetic data and use\nback-translation, text generation for data augmentation. With dataset prepared,\nwe started experimentation.

As the transportation system becomes denser, different\nmodes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other,\ngiving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this\nstudy, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled\ntransportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a\none-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In\nthis system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with\nnon-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus\nthat partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform\nnumerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are\nto each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number\nof zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between\nthe global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves.\nIn contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We\ndeveloped a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that\ntwo distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability\nanalysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations.

Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this,\nbut have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and\ndirection-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of\nobservations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range.\nMany tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to\ninfer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision\ncalibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam\ncentre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially\nobscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a\nsmooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and\nhow this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an\nimprovement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent\ngain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted\nby the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using\ndirection-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam\nmodelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations. The new method outperforms the\nstandard method for various calibration settings near nulls in the beam, and\nmatches the standard inverse-variance-weighted method's performance for the\nremainder of the data. The proposed method is especially effective for short\nbaselines, both in visibility and image space. Improved direction-dependent\ngain-calibration is critical for future high-precision SKA-low observations,\nwhere higher sensitivity, increased antenna beam complexity, and mutual\ncoupling call for better off-axis source subtraction, which may not be achieved\nthrough improved beam models alone.","main_category":"astro-ph.IM","categories":"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-04-03T11:07:25Z"}

PQ partitions the\noriginal feature space into multiple subspaces and independently quantizes each\nsub-vector, producing a fused set of discrete units that retain diverse\ninformation from different subspaces, thus mitigating the loss associated with\nsingle-cluster quantization.

To provide a\nuser-friendly design process, we explore the problem of reverse engineering\nfrom unconstrained real-world CAD images that can be easily captured by users\nof all experiences. However, the scarcity of real-world CAD data poses\nchallenges in directly training such models. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose CADCrafter, an image-to-parametric CAD model generation framework that\ntrains solely on synthetic textureless CAD data while testing on real-world\nimages. To bridge the significant representation disparity between images and\nparametric CAD models, we introduce a geometry encoder to accurately capture\ndiverse geometric features. Moreover, the texture-invariant properties of the\ngeometric features can also facilitate the generalization to real-world\nscenarios. Since compiling CAD parameter sequences into explicit CAD models is\na non-differentiable process, the network training inherently lacks explicit\ngeometric supervision. To impose geometric validity constraints, we employ\ndirect preference optimization (DPO) to fine-tune our model with the automatic\ncode checker feedback on CAD sequence quality.

Capturing scattering behavior across\ndifferent regimes is essential for modeling momentum and energy exchange at the\ngas-surface interface. This study presents a corrugated Cercignani-Lampis-Lord\n(CLL) model to account for surface corrugation in scattering. It extends the\nwashboard-CLL hybrid approach by incorporating tangential momentum\naccommodation in local collisions. The model is validated against molecular\nbeam scattering experiments, focusing on its ability to reproduce the variation\nin scattering behavior with increasing incident energy. Compared to the\nconventional CLL model, the proposed model qualitatively improves the\nrepresentation of key features across the scattering regimes. In particular, it\ncaptures broader angular distributions and increasing reflected energy with\nreflected angle at higher incident energy. It is further applied to Direct\nSimulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) analysis of rarefied flows over a cylinder and\nwithin an intake to examine the influence of surface corrugation on macroscopic\nflow behavior. The results show that surface corrugation has limited impact on\ntotal drag, while decreasing pressure drag and increasing friction drag.

Although Transformer architectures have progressed\nconsiderably in recent years, challenges remain, particularly the limited\nreceptive field in window-based self-attention. In this work, we propose\nDSwinIR, a Deformable Sliding window Transformer for Image Restoration. DSwinIR\nintroduces a novel deformable sliding window self-attention that adaptively\nadjusts receptive fields based on image content, enabling the attention\nmechanism to focus on important regions and enhance feature extraction aligned\nwith salient features. Additionally, we introduce a central ensemble pattern to\nreduce the inclusion of irrelevant content within attention windows. In this\nway, the proposed DSwinIR model integrates the deformable sliding window\nTransformer and central ensemble pattern to amplify the strengths of both CNNs\nand Transformers while mitigating their limitations. Extensive experiments on\nvarious image restoration tasks demonstrate that DSwinIR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. For example, in image deraining, compared to\nDRSformer on the SPA dataset, DSwinIR achieves a 0.66 dB PSNR improvement. In\nall-in-one image restoration, compared to PromptIR, DSwinIR achieves over a\n0.66 dB and 1.04 dB improvement on three-task and five-task settings,\nrespectively.

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the\nuse of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering\nfunctionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss\ncoefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system. Circuit modelling and\nelectromagnetic (EM) simulations were conducted to ensure alignment between\ntheoretical and practical results. The design demonstrates effective unequal\npower division at the three output ports while maintaining very good filtering\nperformance. Results show a return loss better than 15 dB and a minimum\ninsertion loss of 1.2 dB. The overall size of the device is 32.2 x 50.0 mm.\nThis paper contributes to advancements in power divider design by addressing\nunequal power division challenges and integrating filtering functions.

In photonic\ncrystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a\nnon-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of\nhow the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology.\nWe develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of\nphotonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses.\nWithin this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field\npolarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the\ncrystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the\nvicinity of the $\\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the\nhoneycomb lattice.

Although this has facilitated the\napplication and development of technology, it has also increased the difficulty\nof preventing the abuse of generated speech and protecting copyrights. Audio\nwatermarking technology is an effective method for proactively protecting\ngenerated speech, but when the source codes and model weights of the neural\nspeech generation methods are open-sourced, audio watermarks based on previous\nwatermarking methods can be easily removed or manipulated. This paper proposes\na Plug-and-play Parameter-intrinsic WaterMarking (P2Mark) method for neural\nspeech generation system protection. The main advantage of P2Mark is that the\nwatermark information is flexibly integrated into the neural speech generation\nmodel in the form of parameters by training a watermark adapter rather than\ninjecting the watermark into the model in the form of features. After the\nwatermark adapter with the watermark embedding is merged with the pre-trained\ngeneration model, the watermark information cannot be easily removed or\nmanipulated. Therefore, P2Mark will be a reliable choice for proactively\ntracing and protecting the copyrights of neural speech generation models in\nopen-source white-box scenarios. We validated P2Mark on two main types of\ndecoders in neural speech generation: vocoder and codec. Experimental results\nshow that P2Mark achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art audio\nwatermarking methods that cannot be used for open-source white-box protection\nscenarios in terms of watermark extraction accuracy, watermark\nimperceptibility, and robustness.","main_category":"cs.SD","categories":"cs.SD","published":"2025-04-07T15:47:09Z"}

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are\nappealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style\ngenerative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on\nmodeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward.\nInspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e.,\nthe query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs'\ngenerative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents\nwith QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield\na better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever.

In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the\nthree-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is\ndone in an Einstein frame with an infinite-derivative scalar field Lagrangian\nminimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. A non-local generalization of\nthe Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is derived. Infinite-derivative operators present\nin this equation lead to an appearance of infinitely many new background\ninduced states in the perturbation spectrum during inflation with complex\nmasses on top of a usual nearly massless inflaton. On contrary to a flat\nbackground such states can be classically stable in a de Sitter space-time.\nThis helps preserving observational constraints on the scalar power-spectrum.\nWe proceed by studying a particular configuration assuming that the generalized\nMukhanov-Sasaki equation gives rise to an inflaton and one pair of new states\nwith complex conjugate masses as perturbative degrees of freedom. The\ncorresponding scalar bi-spectrum is computed numerically in squeezed and\nequilateral limits. We use the latest observational constraints on amplitude of\nthe bi-spectrum $f_{NL}$ from Planck 2018 dataset as a guideline for possible\nvalues of masses of new emerging states. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially\nsensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter\nspace of gravity modifications. In particular we find that the amplitude of the\nsqueezed limit gets easily enhanced while of the equilateral limit can stay\nlike in a local single-field model of inflation.

Attention sink occurs when an excessive amount of\nattention is allocated to the [CLS] token, distorting the model's ability to\neffectively process image patches. To address this, we introduce a\nlayer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes\nself-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention\nto focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework,\nwhere the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT\nallows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features,\nprogressively refining the representation layer by layer.

However, previous works have primarily focused on\ntwo-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather\nthan pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative\ninvestments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear\npublic goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the\ncooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating\nbenefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit\nfunction, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the\nthreshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For\nintermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies\ncan coexist.

Instruments like\nVLT/SPHERE are state of the art in high-contrast imaging, but their spectral\nresolution (R=50) limits them to basic characterization of close companions.\nThese systems can detect planets down to 5-10 Mjup at 10 AU from their stars.\nDetection limits are mainly constrained by speckle noise, which dominates over\nphoton and detector noise at short separations, even with advanced differential\nimaging. Space-based high-contrast imaging is also limited by image stability.\nSpeckle noise can, however, be mitigated through molecular mapping, a technique\nthat leverages high-resolution spectroscopic data.\n  AIMS: We aim to predict detection limits in spectro-imaging after molecular\nmapping, analyzing how photon and detector noise propagate and comparing\npredictions with real data to assess performance losses from instrumental\neffects. We also propose mitigation strategies and validate our model using\nobservations.\n  METHODS: We analyzed JWST/MIRI/MRS data with FastCurves, an numerical tool,\nand compared results to outputs from the MIRI simulator. We also applied\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) to identify and isolate systematic effects,\nwith and without molecular mapping.\n  RESULTS: We studied various systematic effects and their impacts on signal\nand noise. PCA helped highlight and reduce straylight, fringes, and aliasing.\nWe further compared observed and modeled companion spectra.\n  CONCLUSIONS: FastCurves was improved to account for systematics and validated\nwith real data. In high-flux regimes, systematics impose contrast limits even\nwith molecular mapping. Our approach could benefit other instruments and inform\nthe planning of future facilities like ELT/ANDES and ELT/PCS.","main_category":"astro-ph.IM","categories":"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.EP","published":"2025-04-09T13:51:20Z"}

They are appealing for developing fast\nreference libraries without double rounding issues. The key insight is to build\npolynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with\ntwo additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with\nthe \"non-standard\" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the\nRLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The\nresulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with\nmachine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding\nmode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest\nmode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the\nsystem's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded\nresult, and restores the application's rounding mode. This frequent change of\nrounding modes has a performance cost.\n  This paper proposes two new methods, which we call rounding-invariant outputs\nand rounding-invariant input bounds, to avoid the frequent changes to the\nrounding mode and the dependence on the round-to-nearest mode.

Furthermore, by calculating the polarization,\nwe identify a topological phase transition occurring at an intermediate circuit\nlayer when the initial and final target states lie in different topological\ncharacters.

The goal is to compute the joint\nclusters while preserving the privacy of each entity's dataset. Existing\nsolutions using secret sharing or garbled circuits implement privacy-preserving\nvariants of Lloyd's algorithm but incur high communication costs, scaling as\nO(nkt), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters, and t\nthe number of rounds. These methods become impractical for large datasets or\nseveral parties, limiting their use to LAN settings only. On the other hand, a\ndifferent line of solutions rely on differential privacy (DP) to outsource the\nlocal features of the parties to a central server. However, they often\nsignificantly degrade the utility of the clustering outcome due to excessive\nnoise.

We first review the conventional spatio-temporal\nambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its\nprohibitive complexity when designing for ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus\npropose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the\nestimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a\nswitching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this\nsense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity\nreduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design\napproach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the\nFourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower\ncomputational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based\napproach.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-10T11:56:37Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07916v1","title":"Semantically Encoding Activity Labels for Context-Aware Human Activity\n  Recognition","summary":"Prior work has primarily formulated CA-HAR as a multi-label classification\nproblem, where model inputs are time-series sensor data and target labels are\nbinary encodings representing whether a given activity or context occurs. These\nCA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed\nrelationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential\naspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance,\nwalking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but\ndiffer in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related.\nConsequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these\ninherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels\ntypically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is\nunavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this\nlimitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity\nlabels to capture semantic relationships. LMs generate vector embeddings that\npreserve rich semantic information from natural language. Our SEAL approach\nencodes input-time series sensor data from smart devices and their associated\nactivity and context labels (text) as vector embeddings. During training, SEAL\naligns the sensor data representations with their corresponding\nactivity/context label embeddings in a shared embedding space. At inference\ntime, SEAL performs a similarity search, returning the CA-HAR label with the\nembedding representation closest to the input data. Although LMs have been\nwidely explored in other domains, surprisingly, their potential in CA-HAR has\nbeen underexplored, making our approach a novel contribution to the field. Our\nresearch opens up new possibilities for integrating more advanced LMs into\nCA-HAR tasks.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T17:30:07Z"}

Pristine mono- or\nfew-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice,\nmaking the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked\ngraphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and\nmirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically\nswitchable dipoles.
