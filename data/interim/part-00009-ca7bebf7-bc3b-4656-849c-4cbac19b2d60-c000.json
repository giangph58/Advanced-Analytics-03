The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their\npositions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could\nsignificantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this\npotential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional,\ncomplex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within\na rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and\ncrescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its\nplacement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant\nfrequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of\ninternal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node\ngeneration. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect\nratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the\nchannel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor,\nwhich is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic\nenergy per cycle.

Unlike\nthe extensively studied image domain, limited research has explored the threat\nof backdoor attacks on the reconstruction of symbols in semantic communication\n(SemCom) systems. Previous work has investigated such backdoor attacks at the\ninput level, but these approaches are infeasible in applications with strict\ninput control. In this paper, we propose a novel attack paradigm, termed\nChannel-Triggered Backdoor Attack (CT-BA), where the backdoor trigger is a\nspecific wireless channel. This attack leverages fundamental physical layer\ncharacteristics, making it more covert and potentially more threatening\ncompared to previous input-level attacks. Specifically, we utilize channel gain\nwith different fading distributions or channel noise with different power\nspectral densities as potential triggers. This approach establishes\nunprecedented attack flexibility as the adversary can select backdoor triggers\nfrom both fading characteristics and noise variations in diverse channel\nenvironments. Moreover, during the testing phase, CT-BA enables automatic\ntrigger activation through natural channel variations without requiring active\nadversary participation. We evaluate the robustness of CT-BA on a ViT-based\nJoint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) model across three datasets: MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, and ImageNet.

One of the prominent issues concerning the\nsuperconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either\nas cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason\nremains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system\nBi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system\nis supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily\nobserved in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density\nof states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length)\ncan be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation\npattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0).\nSurprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the\npseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is\nan intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and\nantiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the\nAmperean pairing with finite momentum.

We\nbelieve this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of\ngradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical\nrepresentations -- at least not in the usual sense.

To\ntackle this challenge, we develop the topological prior (TP), a new prior\nconstructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent\npairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions\nunder reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure\nand discontinuities of the function. The TP prior, however, only exists in a\ndiscretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior\nmeasure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a TP-Gaussian\nhybrid prior, where the TP component detects sharp discontinuities in the\nfunction, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring\na well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed TP prior\ndemonstrates effects similar to the classical total variation (TV) prior but\noffers greater flexibility and broader applicability due to three key\nadvantages. First, it is defined on a general topological space, making it\neasily adaptable to a wider range of applications.

It has attracted\nwidespread attention in recent years and has been applied in various domains,\nsuch as deep learning compiler construction. Recently, several MLIR compiler\nfuzzing techniques, such as MLIRSmith and MLIRod, have been proposed. However,\nnone of them can detect silent bugs, i.e., bugs that incorrectly optimize code\nsilently. The difficulty in detecting silent bugs arises from two main aspects:\n(1) UB-Free Program Generation: Ensures the generated programs are free from\nundefined behaviors to suit the non-UB assumptions required by compiler\noptimizations. (2) Lowering Support: Converts the given MLIR program into an\nexecutable form, enabling execution result comparisons, and selects a suitable\nlowering path for the program to reduce redundant lowering pass and improve the\nefficiency of fuzzing. To address the above issues, we propose DESIL. DESIL\nenables silent bug detection by defining a set of UB-elimination rules based on\nthe MLIR documentation and applying them to input programs to produce UB-free\nMLIR programs. To convert dialects in MLIR program into the executable form,\nDESIL designs a lowering path optimization strategy to convert the dialects in\ngiven MLIR program into executable form. Furthermore, DESIL incorporates the\ndifferential testing for silent bug detection. To achieve this, it introduces\nan operation-aware optimization recommendation strategy into the compilation\nprocess to generate diverse executable files. We applied DESIL to the latest\nrevisions of the MLIR compiler infrastructure.

When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization\nis required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of\nrescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting\nLiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization\nmethods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective\nwhen the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a\nrobust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems\n(D-LI-Init).

To enhance the reliability of\nthe LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated\nwithin the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion\nin the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the\niterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry.\nThe proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or\nstationary.

For example, this issue\noften limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to\ntrain multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive\nrollout of a single-step model.

In the present\narticle, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and\nwas already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical\ncontradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost\nentirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may\nsurprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much\nof which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out\nsupposed internal contradictions.

In the first\nsection, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect\nmathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and\nhollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support\nthe necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect\nmathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot\nmove at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction\nin Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier\napparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living\nbeing, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and\nreforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues\nconcerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of\nobservations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between\nintelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of\nPlato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal'\ninterpretation.

Here, we\nshow that the LC order fundamentally changes the nature of the pairing\ninstability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological\nsuperconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In a single-orbital model on\nthe kagome lattice near van Hove filling, the LC CDW is a Chern metal,\nrealizable in concrete models, with a partially filled Chern band hosting three\nChern Fermi pockets (CFPs). We show that Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on\nthe CFPs is described by three SC components coupled by complex Josephson\ncouplings due to LC. The pairing instability is determined by the eigenvalues\nof the complex representation of the cubic group. We show that the Josephson\nphase is controlled by the discrete quantum geometry associated with the\nsublattice permutation group. A small LC can produce a large Josephson phase\nthat drives the leading SC instability to a roton superconductor, where the\ninternal phases of the three SC components are locked at 120^\\circ and loop\nsupercurrents circulate around an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair\ndensity modulations. We demonstrate by self-consistent calculations the\nproperties of the roton superconductor and make theoretical predictions related\nto the recent experimental evidence for an exotic SC state in CsV3Sb5\nexhibiting TRS breaking, anisotropic SC gap, pair density wave modulations, and\ncharge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay\nbetween the orbital-driven anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems such\nas the moire structures.","main_category":"cond-mat.str-el","categories":"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con","published":"2025-04-03T16:43:02Z"}

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers\nis indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation\nlocality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to\nthe states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We\nobserve that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was\nderived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By\nstarting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive\na combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties\nanalogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory.

As a\nprinciple of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading\nprocess, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and\nthe shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency\ndifference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence\nratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the\npreserve of quantum properties. The present quantum frequency shifter is in\nanalog to an electro-optical based shifter, but with much broader tuning\nability. Our all-optical quantum frequency shifter will become a fundamental\nbuilding block for high-speed quantum communication networks and frequency\ndomain photonic quantum computation.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,physics.optics","published":"2025-04-07T11:47:57Z"}

The analysis is conducted\nusing two twin simulations presented in arXiv:1805.09824(1): one based on\ngeneral relativity (GR) and the other on the $f(R)$ Hu $\\&$ Sawicki model with\n$f=10^{-5}$ (F5). This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and\n$f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of\nassessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard\ngravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the\ngrowth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by\nimplementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration\nspace, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis\ndemonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by\nnon-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\\beta$\nparameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small\n(non-linear) scales. We show that this estimator can be accurately measured\nusing mock galaxies in low redshift bins ($z < 1$), where it offers strong\ndiscriminating power over competing gravity theories. We find that, for an\nall-sky galaxy survey and neglecting observational systematics, accurate and\nlargely unbiased estimations of $E_G$ can be obtained across all redshifts.\nHowever, the error bars are too large to clearly distinguish between the\ntheories. When measuring the scale-dependence of the $E_G$ estimator, we note\nthat state-of-the-art theory modeling limitations and intrinsic \"prior volume\neffects\" prevent high-accuracy constraints. Alternatively, we propose a null\ntest of gravity using RSD clustering, which, if small scales are modeled\naccurately in future surveys, could detect significant departures from GR.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-04-07T11:49:43Z"}

Vision-based beam prediction\nutilizing RGB camera images emerges as a promising solution for accurate and\nresponsive beam selection. However, reliance on visual data introduces unique\nvulnerabilities, particularly susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thus\npotentially compromising beam accuracy and overall network reliability. In this\npaper, we conduct the first systematic exploration of adversarial threats\nspecifically targeting vision-based mmWave beam selection systems. Traditional\nwhite-box attacks are impractical in this context because ground-truth beam\nindices are inaccessible and spatial dynamics are complex. To address this, we\npropose a novel black-box adversarial attack strategy, termed Spatial Proxy\nAttack (SPA), which leverages spatial correlations between user positions and\nbeam indices to craft effective perturbations without requiring access to model\nparameters or labels. To counteract these adversarial vulnerabilities, we\nformulate an optimization framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing beam\nselection accuracy under clean conditions and robustness against adversarial\nperturbations. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with\na dedicated Feature Refinement Module (FRM), designed to systematically filter\nirrelevant, noisy and adversarially perturbed visual features.

Existing\nworks in this direction predominantly rely on cross-frame self-attention; which\nimproves subject-consistency by allowing tokens in each frame to pay attention\nto tokens in other frames during self-attention computation. While useful for\nsingle subjects, we find that it struggles when scaling to multiple characters.\nIn this work, we first analyze the reason for these limitations. Our\nexploration reveals that the primary-issue stems from self-attention-leakage,\nwhich is exacerbated when trying to ensure consistency across\nmultiple-characters. This happens when tokens from one subject pay attention to\nother characters, causing them to appear like each other (e.g., a dog appearing\nlike a duck). Motivated by these findings, we propose StoryBooth: a\ntraining-free approach for improving multi-character consistency. In\nparticular, we first leverage multi-modal chain-of-thought reasoning and\nregion-based generation to apriori localize the different subjects across the\ndesired story outputs. The final outputs are then generated using a modified\ndiffusion model which consists of two novel layers: 1) a bounded cross-frame\nself-attention layer for reducing inter-character attention leakage, and 2)\ntoken-merging layer for improving consistency of fine-grain subject details.\nThrough both qualitative and quantitative results we find that the proposed\napproach surpasses prior state-of-the-art, exhibiting improved consistency\nacross both multiple-characters and fine-grain subject details.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.LG,cs.MM","published":"2025-04-08T08:30:55Z"}

The concept of inferred pBSI is\nintroduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov\ndecision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy\nto be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the\nexpected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established\nfor the general single-sensor status update problem.

While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model\ntraining without sharing private data, trained models still retain the\ninfluence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed\noften rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as\nstoring client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available\ndataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method\nthat leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF).\nOur approach only uses standard client model updates, anyway employed during\nregular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients.

Through extensive simulations, we find that the\nadvantageous environment mechanism not only significantly increases the\nproportion of cooperators in the system but also influences the resource\ndistribution among individuals. Additionally, limited resources reinforce\ncooperative behaviors within the system while shaping the evolutionary dynamics\nand strategic interactions across different dilemmas. Once the system reaches\nequilibrium, resource distribution becomes highly imbalanced. To promote fairer\nresource allocation, we introduce a minimum resource guarantee mechanism. Our\nresults show that this mechanism not only reduces disparities in resource\ndistribution across the entire system and among individuals in different\ndilemmas but also significantly enhances cooperative behavior in higher\nresource intervals. Finally, to assess the robustness of our model, we further\nexamine the influence of the advantageous environment on system-wide\ncooperation in small-world and random graph network models.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph","published":"2025-04-08T15:00:31Z"}

Coupled with\na mass consumption society, there is a risk of detrimental social outcomes and\nthreats to democracy, such as misinformation and political polarization. But\nAI, robotics and other emerging technologies could also provide a transition to\ncommunity-based economies, in which more democratic, egalitarian, and\nsustainable value circulations can be established. Based on both a review of\ncase studies, and our own experiments in Detroit, we derive three core\nprinciples for the use of computing in community-based economies. The\nprefigurative principle requires that the development process itself\nincorporates equity goals, rather than viewing equity as something to be\nachieved in the future. The generative principle requires the prevention of\nvalue extraction, and its replacement by circulations in which value is\nreturned back to the aspects of labor, nature, and society by which it is\ngenerated. And third, the solidarity principle requires that deployments at all\nscales and across all domains support both individual freedoms and\nopportunities for mutual aid. Thus we propose the use of computational\ntechnologies to develop a specifically generative form of community-based\neconomy: one that is egalitarian regarding race, class and gender; sustainable\nboth environmentally and socially; and democratic in the deep sense of putting\npeople in control of their own lives and livelihoods.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC,cs.CY","published":"2025-04-08T15:06:10Z"}

However, it suffers from large\nstorage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the\nhash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it\nespecially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D\nreconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose\nGSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during\ntraining, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such\nGaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training,\nwe improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the\nart.

This paper addresses this\nshortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to\nassess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our\nprotocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to\ncreate rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities\nof the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and\nnearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised\nmodel that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf\nfeatures are used in a linear probing setup. In particular, our model is\ntrained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked\nScene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in\na bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our\nexperiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised\napproaches by a large margin.

Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation,\nserve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae\nstars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across\ndifferent metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars\n($[\\rm Fe/H] > -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with a population\nsignificantly younger ($\\approx 6-7$ Gyr) than typically assumed for RR Lyrae\nstars.

Our\nprocedure avoids expensive encoding of the constraints to word equations and,\ninstead, reduces the problem to checking conflicts on positions satisfying an\ninteger constraint obtained from the Parikh image of a polynomial-sized finite\nautomaton with a special structure. By the reduction to counting, solving\nposition constraints becomes NP-complete and for some cases even falls into\nPTime. This is much cheaper than the previously used techniques, which either\nused reductions generating word equations and length constraints (for which\nmodern string solvers use exponential-space algorithms) or incomplete\ntechniques.

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort.

The reconstruction results obtained using data from\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) are better than those obtained using data from\nShort-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which is based on the spectrogram. For the\nsingle-peak template, the estimation accuracy of the exponent and peak\nfrequency surpasses that of the BPL template by an order of magnitude, but\ndemonstrates less precision in amplitude estimation compared to BPL. Regarding\nthe double-peak template, parameter estimation results derived from the FFT\nmethodology consistently outperform those obtained using STFT. Nevertheless,\ntransient signals exhibit a detrimental impact on parameter estimation\nprecision, causing errors to increase by an order of magnitude, particularly in\nmulti-peak scenarios.

In particular, heart\nfailures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early,\nrapid and effective prediction. In this work, an automatic system which\nanalyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences is proposed for the\nchallenging and more specific task of prediction of heart failure times. This\nsystem is based on a novel deep learning framework, and works in two stages.\nThe first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography\nvideo sequences into a machine learning-compatible collection of annotated\nimages which can be used in the training phase of any kind of machine\nlearning-based framework, including a deep learning one. This initial stage\nincludes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD)\nalgorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage\nis focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT). Self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) methods, which have been so far barely explored in the\nliterature about heart failure prediction, are applied to effectively train the\nViT from scratch, even with scarce databases of echocardiograms. The designed\nneural network analyses images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the\ntime in which a heart failure will happen. The results obtained show the\nefficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of the proposed system with\nrespect to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\narchitectures.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.CV","published":"2025-04-10T09:57:09Z"}

Unforeseen\nfluctuations in earnings pose challenges in financial planning, affecting\ndecisions on savings and spending and ultimately undermining individuals'\nlong-term financial stability and well-being.\n  This issue is particularly evident in sectors where workers experience\nfrequently changing schedules without sufficient notice, including those in the\nfood service and retail sectors, part-time and hourly workers, and individuals\nwith lower incomes.

The process involves generating\nshort-lived microdischarges on the material surface through anodic dielectric\nbreakdown in a conductive aqueous solution. To investigate single\nmicrodischarges during PEO, a single microdischarge setup was developed, where\nthe active anode surface is reduced to the tip of a wire with a diameter of 1\nmm. In this work the focus is on the effect of electrolyte concentration, anode\nmaterial, and electrical parameters on the microdischarges. The electrolyte is\ncomposed of distilled water with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide\n(0.5 - 4 g/l). High-speed optical measurements are conducted to gain insights\ninto the formation and temporal evolution of individual microdischarges and the\ninduced gas bubble formation.

A typical\nasynchronous protocol is designed by executing sequential instances of the\nAsynchronous Common Sub-seQuence (ACSQ).

To address these issues,we propose Falcon, an asynchronous BFT\nprotocol that achieves low latency and enhanced throughput.

However, the limited availability of detailed\necological data, especially for complex ecological interactions creates\nuncertainty in model predictions, often requiring adjustments to the\nmathematical formulation of these interactions. Modifying the mathematical\nrepresentation of components responsible for complex behaviors, such as\npredation, can further contribute to this uncertainty, a phenomenon known as\nstructural sensitivity. Structural sensitivity has been explored primarily in\nnon-spatial systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and in\na limited number of simple, spatially extended systems modeled by\nnonhomogeneous parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), where\nself-diffusion alone cannot produce spatial patterns. In this study, we broaden\nthe scope of structural sensitivity analysis to include spatio-temporal\necological systems in which spatial patterns can emerge due to diffusive\ninstability.

Consequently, researchers have turned to\nsynthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic\nstrategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying\nphysical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies\nthat hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we\nintroduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through\nMath-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and\nemploys a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality\nEstimator(SQE).

Recent advancements in\nLatent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) have shown promise by integrating generative\nmodels such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) to manage the complexity of\nhigh-dimensional and structured data spaces. However, existing LBO approaches\noften suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the\nreconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy\nproblem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based\nBayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative\nmodel to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the\nlatent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the\nreconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive\nnormalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate\nsampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each\ntoken based on its importance. Through extensive experiments, our NF-BO method\ndemonstrates superior performance in molecule generation tasks, significantly\noutperforming both traditional and recent LBO approaches.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-21T06:36:09Z"}

We conducted\nmuon flux attenuation measurements to validate its response using variable lead\nshielding. We found agreement with simulations generated using the MEIGA\nframework and realistic cosmic ray spectra from the ARTI simulation chain. With\nthe detector response validated, we modelled muon transmission through a\nrealistic 3D representation of a hydrotreatment tower, incorporating internal\nvariations in catalyst bed density. By reconstructing angular muon fluxes and\ncomputing relative attenuation maps, we demonstrated the system's capability to\ndetect internal density contrasts. Simulation results indicate that 20~hours of\nexposure to vertical muon flux is sufficient to retrieve structural\ninformation. In comparison, inclined configurations (30$^\\circ$ and 60$^\\circ$\nfrom vertical) require extended exposure times--up to 8~days--yet remain\nfeasible within industrial monitoring schedules. These findings highlight the\nfeasibility of muography as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for complex\nindustrial infrastructure.

However, the\nformation mechanisms of these post-peak bumps remain a matter of debate.\nFurthermore, previous studies employing the magnetar-powered model have\ntypically assumed a fixed magnetic inclination angle and neglected the effects\nof magnetar precession. However, recent research has shown that the precession\nof newborn magnetars forming during the collapse of massive stars causes the\nmagnetic inclination angle to evolve over time, thereby influencing magnetic\ndipole radiation. In this paper, therefore, we incorporate the effects of\nmagnetar precession into the magnetar-powered model to develop the precessing\nmagnetar-powered model.

Additionally, we\nconstruct five differential operators, $\\Lambda_i$, which promote a conformal\nblock in $d$ dimensions to five conformal blocks in $d+2$ dimensions. These\noperators can be normalized such that $\\sum_i \\Lambda_i = 1$, from which the\nKRT identity immediately follows. Similar, simpler identities have been\nproposed, all of which can be reformulated in the same way.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th","published":"2025-04-22T13:44:16Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15922v1","title":"Language Models to Support Multi-Label Classification of Industrial Data","summary":"Multi-label requirements classification is a challenging task, especially\nwhen dealing with numerous classes at varying levels of abstraction. The\ndifficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to\ntrain a supervised classifier. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require\ntraining data and can potentially address this problem. This paper investigates\nthe performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial\ndataset. We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed\nto support requirements tracing. We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using\ndifferent embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number\nof parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large\nnumber of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama. Our ground truth includes 377\nrequirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces. For the evaluation, we adopt\ntraditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\\beta$, as well as a\nnovel label distance metric Dn. This aims to better capture the\nclassification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of\nhow far the results are from the ground truth. 1) The top-performing model on 5\nout of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04,\nwhile BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum\n$F_\\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04. 2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the\nbest classification results compared to LLMs. Thus, addressing the problem in\npractice is feasible as limited computing power is needed. 3) The model\narchitecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence)\nsignificantly affects the classifier's performance. We conclude that using ZSL\nfor multi-label requirements classification offers promising results.

The upcoming generation of radio\ntelescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data\nreduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these\nexperiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we\ndeal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the\nclassical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the\npast, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing\nnumerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a\nnew algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the\ndata reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation\nof instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components\nfitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to\nderive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis\nfunctions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior\nreconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their\nsuperior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of\nsuper-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and\nsubminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining\nthese advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than\nthe classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic\nframework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward\nto include in future data reduction pipelines.

Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction\nsequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their\nrepresentations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific\nintents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for\nbeauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise,\ndisrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction\nsequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may\nmislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding\nspace and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To\naddress these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive\nlearning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate\nitem sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more\nreliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first\nperforms intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build\nintent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the\ntarget interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating\npositive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive\nlearning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these\nintent-aligned views and the original sequence.

Agents deposit\nchemicals only while moving, and their future motion is biased by local\nchemical gradients. This interaction generates a rich variety of self-organized\nstructures resembling those seen in processes like early vasculogenesis and\nepithelial cell dispersal.

Here, we realize autonomous QEC with a logical qubit\nencoded in multiple internal spin states of a single trapped ion, surpassing\nthe break-even point for qubit lifetime. Our approach leverages engineered\nspin-motion couplings to transfer error-induced entropy into motional modes,\nwhich are subsequently dissipated through sympathetic cooling with an ancilla\nion, fully eliminating the need for measurement and feedback. By repetitively\napplying this autonomous QEC protocol under injected low-frequency noise, we\nextend the logical qubit lifetime to approximately 11.6 ms, substantially\noutperforming lifetime for both the physical qubit ($\\simeq$0.9 ms) and the\nuncorrected logical qubit ($\\simeq$0.8 ms), thereby beating the break-even\npoint with autonomous protection of quantum information without measurement or\npost-selection. This work presents an efficient approach to fault-tolerant\nquantum computing that harnesses the intrinsic multi-level structure of trapped\nions, providing a distinctive path toward scalable architectures and robust\nquantum memories with reduced overhead.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-23T14:16:41Z"}

However, since their behavior is probed via\nchiral edge modes, bulk-to-edge and inter-edge interactions are two important\neffects that affect the observations. Moreover, almost all kinds of\ninterferometers heavily rely on a pair of high-quality quantum point contacts\nwhere the presence of impurities significantly modifies the behavior of such\nconstrictions, which in turn can alter the outcome of the measurements.\nAntidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable\nin this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional\ngeometries and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact.\nFurthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through simple\nconductance measurements, replacing the need for complex techniques such as\nshot noise. Here, we use a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot, operated in\nthe Coulomb-dominated regime. By varying the antidot potential, we can tune\ninter-edge interactions, enabling a crossover from a single-dot to a double-dot\nbehavior. In the latter, strong coupling between the two edge states leads to\nedge-state pairing, resulting in a measured doubling of the tunneling charge.\nWe find that in certain regimes, the inter-edge coupling completely dominates\nover other energy scales of the system, overshadowing the interference effects\nthese devices are mainly designed to probe. These results highlight the\nsignificant role of inter-edge interactions and establish antidots as a\nversatile platform for exploring quantum Hall interferometry.","main_category":"cond-mat.mes-hall","categories":"cond-mat.mes-hall","published":"2025-04-23T14:19:20Z"}

However, it can\nbe very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these\nspecifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially\nwhen the software requirements change.

Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total\nexposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to\ndate. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we\ninferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into\nthe jet-ISM interaction site.\n  Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely\ninduced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity\nin the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\\,cm$^{-3}$\nwhile assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\\,K, which implies a bow\nshock expansion velocity of $20\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}<\\dot{L} <\\,360\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s}^{-1}$.

More worryingly,\nwe show how these powerful attacks can be fully mounted directly from web\nbrowsers themselves, through the File System Access API, a recent feature added\nby Chromium browsers that enables a website to directly manipulate a user's\nfile system via JavaScript. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an\nattacker can install malicious browser extensions, inject additional root\ncertificates, hijack HTTPS traffic, and enable websites to access hardware\ndevices like the camera and GPS. Based on our findings, we argue that\nresearchers and browser vendors need to develop and deploy more secure\nmechanisms for protecting users' browser data against file system attackers.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR","published":"2025-04-24T16:01:48Z"}

Annealing time was changed under specific conditions to achieve a stable\ncopper (Cu) doping concentration for HgCdTe thin films. Both MWIR and LWIR\nHgCdTe material were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), where different\ntrends were observed between LWIR and MWIR HgCdTe thin films by increasing\nanneal time. We also report the impact of different thickness (4 micron, 6\nmicron and 9 micron) along with annealing time on doping level of LWIR HgCdTe\nthin films.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph","published":"2025-04-24T16:14:33Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17771v1","title":"Integrating Learning-Based Manipulation and Physics-Based Locomotion for\n  Whole-Body Badminton Robot Control","summary":"Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement\nlearning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot\ntasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized\nlearning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity\nand ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this\npaper, we introduce \\ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile\nbadminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis\nlocomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a\nphysics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In\nthis train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is\nused to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we\ntrain the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue\nwhen transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered\nbadminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and\n90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized\nto other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table\ntennis.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17776v1","title":"Fitting Tree Metrics and Ultrametrics in Data Streams","summary":"Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used\nmethods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of\nnumerical taxonomy. Given a positive distance function\n$D:\\binom{V}{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or\nultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference\nbetween the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is\nminimized. In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric\nfitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs\nof elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in\nan arbitrary order. We study these problems under various distance norms:\n  For the $\\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove\nthat no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.\n  Next, we show that the algorithm for $\\ell_0$ implies an $O(\\Delta/\\delta)$\napproximation for the $\\ell_1$ objective, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum and\n$\\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input.\nThis bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a\ncombinatorial algorithm when $\\Delta/\\delta=O(n)$.\n  For the $\\ell_\\infty$ objective, we provide a complete characterization of\nthe ultrametric fitting problem. We present a single-pass polynomial-time\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$-space 2-approximation algorithm and show that no better than\n2-approximation is possible, even with exponential time. We also show that,\nwith an additional pass, it is possible to achieve a polynomial-time exact\nalgorithm for ultrametrics.\n  Finally, we extend the results for all these objectives to tree metrics by\nusing only one additional pass through the stream and without asymptotically\nincreasing the approximation factor.","main_category":"cs.DS","categories":"cs.DS","published":"2025-04-24T17:49:25Z"}
