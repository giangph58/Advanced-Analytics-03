This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are\npromising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward\ngeneral-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-03-27T16:35:02Z"}

To this end, this paper addresses\nminimizing average EMF exposure while maintaining coverage in a 3D urban\nscenario by jointly optimizing BS deployment and power.

In this study, we employ an\nadaptive control mechanism by which agents may benefit from their environment,\nthus redefining their individual fitness. Under this setting, a detailed\nexamination of the co-evolution of individual strategies and resource\nallocation is carried. Through extensive simulations, we find that the\nadvantageous environment mechanism not only significantly increases the\nproportion of cooperators in the system but also influences the resource\ndistribution among individuals. Additionally, limited resources reinforce\ncooperative behaviors within the system while shaping the evolutionary dynamics\nand strategic interactions across different dilemmas. Once the system reaches\nequilibrium, resource distribution becomes highly imbalanced. To promote fairer\nresource allocation, we introduce a minimum resource guarantee mechanism. Our\nresults show that this mechanism not only reduces disparities in resource\ndistribution across the entire system and among individuals in different\ndilemmas but also significantly enhances cooperative behavior in higher\nresource intervals.

Coupled with\na mass consumption society, there is a risk of detrimental social outcomes and\nthreats to democracy, such as misinformation and political polarization. But\nAI, robotics and other emerging technologies could also provide a transition to\ncommunity-based economies, in which more democratic, egalitarian, and\nsustainable value circulations can be established. Based on both a review of\ncase studies, and our own experiments in Detroit, we derive three core\nprinciples for the use of computing in community-based economies. The\nprefigurative principle requires that the development process itself\nincorporates equity goals, rather than viewing equity as something to be\nachieved in the future. The generative principle requires the prevention of\nvalue extraction, and its replacement by circulations in which value is\nreturned back to the aspects of labor, nature, and society by which it is\ngenerated. And third, the solidarity principle requires that deployments at all\nscales and across all domains support both individual freedoms and\nopportunities for mutual aid. Thus we propose the use of computational\ntechnologies to develop a specifically generative form of community-based\neconomy: one that is egalitarian regarding race, class and gender; sustainable\nboth environmentally and socially; and democratic in the deep sense of putting\npeople in control of their own lives and livelihoods.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC,cs.CY","published":"2025-04-08T15:06:10Z"}

In particular, our model is\ntrained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked\nScene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in\na bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our\nexperiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised\napproaches by a large margin.

In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well\nestablished x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support\nall current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture.

However,\nthe high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the\ninference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory\n(CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache\npruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a\nfixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer\nfrom either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we\npropose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory\n(CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous\nsupport for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM\nmode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for\ndynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain\nCIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity\nscore, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the\ncurrent-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset\nof selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that\nleverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage\nof the KV cache and in-place attention computation.

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort.

The inability to rely\non consistent work schedules leads to burnout, work-family conflicts, and\nfinancial shocks that directly impact workers' income and assets. Unforeseen\nfluctuations in earnings pose challenges in financial planning, affecting\ndecisions on savings and spending and ultimately undermining individuals'\nlong-term financial stability and well-being.\n  This issue is particularly evident in sectors where workers experience\nfrequently changing schedules without sufficient notice, including those in the\nfood service and retail sectors, part-time and hourly workers, and individuals\nwith lower incomes. These groups are already more financially vulnerable, and\nthe unpredictable nature of their schedules exacerbates their financial\nfragility.\n  Our objective is to understand how unforeseen fluctuations in earnings\nexacerbate financial fragility by investigating the extent to which\nindividuals' financial management depends on their ability to anticipate and\nplan for the future. To address this question, we develop a simulation\nframework that models how individuals optimize utility amidst financial\nuncertainty and the imperative to avoid financial ruin. We employ online\nlearning techniques, specifically adapting workers' consumption policies based\non evolving information about their work schedules.\n  With this framework, we show both theoretically and empirically how a\nworker's capacity to anticipate schedule changes enhances their long-term\nutility. Conversely, the inability to predict future events can worsen workers'\ninstability. Moreover, our framework enables us to explore interventions to\nmitigate the problem of schedule uncertainty and evaluate their effectiveness.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CY","published":"2025-04-10T13:09:56Z"}

In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a\nretrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve\nsupportive codes for real-world code generation.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising\nsolution to enhance model performance by integrating external databases,\nwithout requiring intensive on-device model retraining. However, large-scale\npublic databases and user-specific private contextual documents are typically\nlocated on the cloud and the device separately, while existing RAG\nimplementations are primarily centralized. To bridge this gap, we propose\nDRAGON, a distributed RAG framework to enhance on-device SLMs through both\ngeneral and personal knowledge without the risk of leaking document privacy.\nSpecifically, DRAGON decomposes multi-document RAG into multiple parallel token\ngeneration processes performed independently and locally on the cloud and the\ndevice, and employs a newly designed Speculative Aggregation, a dual-side\nspeculative algorithm to avoid frequent output synchronization between the\ncloud and device. A new scheduling algorithm is further introduced to identify\nthe optimal aggregation side based on real-time network conditions.

Under circular scanning mode, such artifacts\nmanifest as concentric rings radiating from the center of rotation, severely\ndegrading image quality. In the Radon transform domain, even if the object's\ndensity function is piecewise discontinuous in certain regions, the projection\nimages remain nearly continuous in the angular direction, making the ideal\nprojections exhibit a smooth global low-frequency characteristic. In practical\nscanning, the local disturbances of the same detector unit at different\nscanning angles lead to a prominent high-frequency locality of stripe\nartifacts. Existing studies generally model ring artifacts disturbances as\nfixed additive errors, which overlooks the dynamic variation of detector\nresponses during practical scanning. However, the degree of detector response\ninconsistency is a function of the projection values, as revealed in our\nexperiments, thereby requiring consideration of the interaction between global\nand local features in the process of stripe artifacts extraction and\ncorrection. Therefore, we propose a CT ring artifacts correction method based\non global and local features in the projection domain. We employ the VSS block\nand Dense block to respectively correct the low-frequency sub-band, which\ncapture the global correlations of the projection, and the high-frequency\nsub-band, which contain local stripe artifacts after wavelet decomposition.\nSpecifically, the accuracy of artifacts correction is enhanced by the\ninteraction guidance between global and local features.

Specifically, our\napproach includes a pseudo-label generation module that leverages high-fidelity\nsynthetic samples to create an auxiliary classifier, which captures richer\nvisual variation, bridging text-image-pair classification to a more robust\nimage-image-pair classification. Additionally, we exploit the diversity of\ndiffusion-based synthetic samples to enhance prompt learning, providing greater\ninformation for semantic-visual alignment. Extensive experiments on five public\nbenchmarks, including RESISC45 and Flowers102, and across three learning\nparadigms-UL, SSL, and TRZSL-demonstrate that AiR achieves substantial and\nconsistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised prompt\nlearning methods.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-16T10:09:45Z"}

To address these issues,we propose Falcon, an asynchronous BFT\nprotocol that achieves low latency and enhanced throughput.

We identified key\nobservational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions,\nU-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The\nposition-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction\nbetween two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an\nestimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated\ncollision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of\ncollision-induced star formation.

The\ndifficulties increases when a limited number of requirements is available to\ntrain a supervised classifier. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) does not require\ntraining data and can potentially address this problem. This paper investigates\nthe performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial\ndataset. We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed\nto support requirements tracing. We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using\ndifferent embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number\nof parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large\nnumber of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama. Our ground truth includes 377\nrequirements and 1968 labels from 6 output spaces. For the evaluation, we adopt\ntraditional metrics, i.e., precision, recall, F1, and $F_\\beta$, as well as a\nnovel label distance metric Dn. This aims to better capture the\nclassification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of\nhow far the results are from the ground truth. 1) The top-performing model on 5\nout of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04,\nwhile BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum\n$F_\\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04. 2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the\nbest classification results compared to LLMs. Thus, addressing the problem in\npractice is feasible as limited computing power is needed. 3) The model\narchitecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence)\nsignificantly affects the classifier's performance.

The upcoming generation of radio\ntelescopes poses significant challenges to existing, and well proven data\nreduction pipelines due to the large data sizes expected from these\nexperiments, and the high resolution and dynamic range. In this manuscript, we\ndeal with the deconvolution problem. A variety of multiscalar variants to the\nclassical CLEAN algorithm (the de-facto standard) have been proposed in the\npast, often outperforming CLEAN at the cost of significantly increasing\nnumerical resources. In this work, we aim to combine some of these ideas for a\nnew algorithm, Autocorr-CLEAN, to accelerate the deconvolution and prepare the\ndata reduction pipelines for the data sizes expected by the upcoming generation\nof instruments. To this end, we propose to use a cluster of CLEAN components\nfitted to the autocorrelation function of the residual in a subminor loop, to\nderive continuously changing, and potentially non-radially symmetric, basis\nfunctions for CLEANing the residual. Autocorr-CLEAN allows for the superior\nreconstruction fidelity achieved by modern multiscalar approaches, and their\nsuperior convergence speed. It achieves this without utilizing any substep of\nsuper-linear complexity in the minor loops, keeping the single minor loop and\nsubminor loop iterations at an execution time comparable to CLEAN. Combining\nthese advantages, Autocorr-CLEAN is found to be up to a magnitude faster than\nthe classical CLEAN procedure. Autocorr-CLEAN fits well in the algorithmic\nframework common for radio interferometry, making it relatively straightforward\nto include in future data reduction pipelines. With its accelerated convergence\nspeed, and smaller residual, Autocorr-CLEAN may be an important asset for the\ndata analysis in the future.","main_category":"astro-ph.IM","categories":"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-22T17:33:55Z"}

Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction\nsequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their\nrepresentations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific\nintents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for\nbeauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise,\ndisrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction\nsequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may\nmislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding\nspace and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To\naddress these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive\nlearning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate\nitem sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more\nreliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first\nperforms intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build\nintent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the\ntarget interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating\npositive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive\nlearning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these\nintent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared\nto existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy\nand sparse data conditions.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-22T17:55:56Z"}

The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations.

Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element\nMethod (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational\ncost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty\nquantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where\nmany repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate\nmodeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using\nfast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms\nare trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and\nstatistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective\ncontact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair\ncomparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency,\nevaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel\nRidge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and\nefficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and\nminimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose\nsurrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive\nalternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs\nadditional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization\ncapability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation\nscenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations.

To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the\nacquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential.\nHowever, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is\nperformed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails\nestimating the CSI for all $M \\times M$ switch array permutations, resulting in\na total of $M!$ possible configurations, to identify the optimal one that\nmaximizes the channel gain. This process leads to long uplink training\nintervals, which degrade spectral efficiency and increase uplink energy\nconsumption. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation\nprotocol that substantially reduces the need for exhaustive $M!$ permutations\nby utilizing only three configurations to optimize the non-diagonal RIS switch\narray and beamforming for single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, our three-stage pilot-based\nprotocol estimates scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS)\nchannels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the\ncommonly used ON/OFF protocol from conventional RIS. In the third stage, the\ncascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming\noptimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol\nsignificantly reduces the BS computational load from $\\mathcal{O}(NM\\times M!)$\nto $\\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas.

Ce-BAS is a rare\nexample of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy\nrattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric\nperformance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a\ntemperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static\ncrystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing\nbetween the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large\ninternal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are\nwell described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an\nenergy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field\nstates. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework\npoints to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential.

The vast majority of known gadget chains rely on gadgets from\nsoftware dependencies. Furthermore, it has been shown that small code changes\nin dependencies have enabled these gadget chains. This makes gadget chain\ndetection a purely reactive endeavor. Even if one dependency's deployment\npipeline employs gadget chain detection, a gadget chain can still result from\ngadgets in other dependencies. In this work, we assess how likely small code\nchanges are to enable a gadget chain. These changes could either be accidental\nor intentional as part of a supply chain attack. Specifically, we show that\nclass serializability is a strongly fluctuating property over a dependency's\nevolution. Then, we investigate three change patterns by which an attacker\ncould stealthily introduce gadgets into a dependency. We apply these patterns\nto 533 dependencies and run three state-of-the-art gadget chain detectors both\non the original and the modified dependencies. The tools detect that applying\nthe modification patterns can activate/inject gadget chains in 26.08% of the\ndependencies we selected. Finally, we verify the newly detected chains. As\nsuch, we identify dormant gadget chains in 53 dependencies that could be added\nthrough minor code modifications. This both shows that Java deserialization\ngadget chains are a broad liability to software and proves dormant gadget\nchains as a lucrative supply chain attack vector.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR,cs.SE","published":"2025-04-29T07:24:34Z"}

However, traditional methods struggle to\neffectively recommend new-items due to their short exposure time and limited\ninteraction records, especially in dynamic recommender systems (DRSs) where\nnew-items get continuously introduced and users' preferences evolve over time.\nThis leads to significant unfairness towards new-items, which could accumulate\nover the successive model updates, ultimately compromising the stability of the\nentire system. Therefore, we propose FairAgent, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based new-item fairness enhancement framework specifically designed for\nDRSs. It leverages knowledge distillation to extract collaborative signals from\ntraditional models, retaining strong recommendation capabilities for old-items.\nIn addition, FairAgent introduces a novel reward mechanism for recommendation\ntailored to the characteristics of DRSs, which consists of three components: 1)\na new-item exploration reward to promote the exposure of dynamically introduced\nnew-items, 2) a fairness reward to adapt to users' personalized fairness\nrequirements for new-items, and 3) an accuracy reward which leverages users'\ndynamic feedback to enhance recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on\nthree public datasets and backbone models demonstrate the superior performance\nof FairAgent. The results present that FairAgent can effectively boost new-item\nexposure, achieve personalized new-item fairness, while maintaining high\nrecommendation accuracy.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-30T06:49:36Z"}

We address this question with a\nsimple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove\nplanets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture\nchange. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then\nrepeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying\nhyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as\nfaithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the\nfailure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced\nplanets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially\nunaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is\nthat the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the\nobservation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection\nbias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the\nobserved planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of\nthe Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the\ninterpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular\nspacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary\narchitectures that reproduces these observed patterns.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM","published":"2025-04-30T16:02:58Z"}

To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce\nKnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.\nKnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them\nusing statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity\nstatistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model\n(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode\nconnectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating\nknowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,\nKnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep\nlearning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,\nmental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG\nclassification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG\nprovides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for\nunderstandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open\nclassification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge\nabout the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed\nclassification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.\nTherefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG\nexplainability is critical such as healthcare.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-05-01T14:05:55Z"}

In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body\nsimulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin\nbaths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several\nunique phenomena and their origin.

Accurate brain tumor segmentation\nremains challenging due to their irregular shapes, vague boundaries, and high\nvariability. Objective: We propose a brain tumor segmentation method that\ncombines deep learning with prior knowledge derived from a region-growing\nalgorithm. Methods: The proposed method utilizes a multi-scale feature fusion\n(MSFF) module and adaptive attention mechanisms (AAM) to extract multi-scale\nfeatures and capture global contextual information. To enhance the model's\nrobustness in low-confidence regions, the Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout)\nstrategy is employed for uncertainty estimation. Results: Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance on Brain\nTumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets, significantly outperforming various\nstate-of-the-art methods. On the BraTS2021 dataset, the test Dice scores are\n89.18% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) segmentation, 93.67% for Whole Tumor (WT)\nsegmentation, and 91.23% for Tumor Core (TC) segmentation.

Isolated offshore communities, such as\nislands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or\ndiesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy\nintegration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines,\nwave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired\nwith a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper\nintroduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to\nidentify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for\noffshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting\nfor battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a\ndeep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in\nvariables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge,\ndepth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions\ndemonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while\nmaintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design\nsolution for offshore microgrid systems.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-05-08T14:51:30Z"}

These temporal-only NVCs fail to\nhandle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned\nlatent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video\nCodec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial\nreferences. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to\ngenerate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts.\nSecondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the\nprior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by\nmultiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint\nspatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for\nspatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental\nresults show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling\nlarge motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the\nprevious state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution\nbitstream.

Within\na molecular framework, the interaction in the heavy quark sector is governed by\ngluon exchange or confinement forces that are inherently color-dependent. While\nthe $B_c B_c$ system contains two identical quarks, enabling stronger\ninteractions via exchange diagrams, the forces in the $B_c \\bar{B}_c$ and\n$(c\\bar{c})-(b\\bar{b})$ systems are expected to be significantly weaker.\nConsequently, the theoretical and experimental analysis of $B_c^{(*)}\nB_c^{(*)}$, $B_c^{(*)} \\bar{B}_c^{(*)}$, and charmonium-bottomonium bound\nstructures could play a crucial role in clarifying the dominant mechanisms\nresponsible for the formation of fully-heavy tetraquarks.

Furthermore, our\nresearch shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly\nbeautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic\nresponses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with\nminimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to\ngenerate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum\nSemantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of\n10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image\nmetrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful\nimages with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship\nbetween image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study\nreveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and\naesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting\neffects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,q-bio.NC,stat.CO","published":"2025-05-08T15:22:11Z"}
