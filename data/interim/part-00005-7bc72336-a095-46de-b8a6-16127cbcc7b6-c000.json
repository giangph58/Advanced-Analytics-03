This work systematically explores\nthe duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and\nGalilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical\nactions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of\nmotion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with\nelectric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond\nto both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic\nunderpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,\nrevealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean\nalgebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric\nframework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime\ngeometries.

This is because\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison\nof the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in\norder to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-03-27T16:33:52Z"}

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory\ntime, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional\ncoefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations.

This\nmodel is used for image retrieval, where typically a first ranking is performed\nwith an efficient similarity measure, and then a shortlist of top-ranked images\nis re-ranked based on a more fine-grained similarity measure. Compared to\nexisting methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local\ndescriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the\nfirst method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors. To achieve\nthis, we leverage efficient long-context sequence models to effectively capture\nthe dependencies between query and gallery images at the local-descriptor\nlevel.

One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify\nclasses of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical\ncomputer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical\ndevice, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device\nthat is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study\nhow the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such\ntechnique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the\nresult of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces\ncircuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum\ndevice.\n  The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of\nnonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical\nside, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple\nsmaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit\nknitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the\nresource theory of entanglement. We characterize the optimal simulation\noverhead for a broad range of practically relevant nonlocal states and channels\nand we explicitly provide achieving protocols. Moreover, we also investigate\nthe utility of classical communication between the local parties.

As such, in this paper,\nwe propose the first work to attack Agent4RSs by perturbing agents' memories,\nnot only to uncover their limitations but also to enhance their security and\nrobustness, ensuring the development of safer and more reliable AI agents.\n  Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to launch\nattacks under a black-box setting, where the accurate knowledge of the victim\nmodels cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, the practical attacks are often\nstealthy to maximize the impact. To this end, we propose a novel practical\nattack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent consists of a generation module,\na strategy module, and a surrogate module. The generation module aims to\nproduce effective and coherent adversarial textual triggers, which can be used\nto achieve attack objectives such as promoting the target items. The strategy\nmodule is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories\ncannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the\ntriggers can play the best role. Both of the modules are optimized on the\nsurrogate module to improve the transferability and imperceptibility of the\nattacks. By identifying and analyzing the vulnerabilities, our work provides\ncritical insights that pave the way for building safer and more resilient\nAgent4RSs. Extensive experiments across various real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DrunkAgent.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR,cs.CL,cs.IR,cs.MA","published":"2025-03-31T07:35:40Z"}

We develop a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory\nPhoto-z) and apply it to the GAMA photometric catalogue.\n  Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate\nphoto-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. Using nine-band photometric data\nfrom the GAMA project, we assess the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z\nestimates to available spectroscopic redshifts. We generate synthetic galaxy\nspectra using the CIGALE software and run template set optimisation. We improve\nthe photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical\nprior is then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift\nestimates.\n  Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the\nspectroscopic redshifts. We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various\nmagnitude bins and test how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the\nactual uncertainty of the estimates. We show that the TOPz results are\nconsistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes applied to the same\ndata set.

From the perspective of\npremerger electromagnetic emissions and next-generation gravitational-wave\ndetectors, gravity ($g-$) modes constitute a propitious class. However,\nexisting estimates for their impact employ linear schemes which may be\ninaccurate for large amplitudes, as achieved by tidal resonances. With\nrotation, inertial modes can be excited as well and while their non-linear\nsaturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial\nmodes, especially in the neutron-star context, is an open problem. We study the\nlinear and non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes and investigate the\nastrophysical consequences for binary neutron-star mergers, including the\npossibility of resonance-induced dynamo activity. A new (non-)linear\nformulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is\ndeveloped. Implementing this into the 3D pseudo-spectral code MagIC, a suite of\nnon-linear simulations of tidally-excited flows with an entropy/composition\ngradient in a stably-stratified Boussinesq spherical-shell are carried out. The\nnew formulation accurately reproduces results of linear calculations for\ngravito-inertial modes with a free surface for low frequencies.

A key result is a significant increase\nin the predicted detection rate when MBH orbital eccentricity is included,\nrising from 5.6 for circular orbits to 10.5 events per year. This boost is\nlargely due to inspiral sources that will merge after LISA's mission period,\nwhich make up 46% of detections in the eccentric case. This highlights LISA's\nsensitivity to early inspiral phases, especially for eccentric binaries that\nemit across a wider frequency band. Most LISA detections arise from\n$M_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\sim 10^{5-6}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, low-redshift ($z<2$), low\nmass-ratio ($q\\sim 0.01$--$0.1$) mergers, complementing instruments like Pulsar\nTiming Arrays (PTAs).

To address these challenges, we propose CFMD, a novel\ncross-layer feature pyramid network that introduces two key innovations. First,\nwe design a context-aware feature aggregation module (CFLMA), which\nincorporates the state-of-the-art Mamba architecture to construct a dynamic\nweight distribution mechanism. This module adaptively adjusts feature\nimportance based on image context, significantly improving both representation\nefficiency and generalization. Second, we introduce an adaptive dynamic\nupsampling unit (CFLMD) that preserves spatial details during resolution\nrecovery. By adjusting the upsampling range dynamically and initializing with a\nbilinear strategy, the module effectively reduces feature overlap and maintains\nfine-grained boundary structures. Extensive experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD\nachieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary\nsegmentation quality, especially in complex scenes. The results validate the\neffectiveness of CFMD in jointly enhancing computational efficiency and\nsegmentation performance, highlighting its strong potential in salient object\ndetection tasks.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-02T03:22:36Z"}

By employing a gating network to route input\ntokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the\ncorresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is\nchallenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation,\nwhich leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and\ninsufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by\nnumerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level.\nPrevious works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized\nby the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to\nstatic execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at\nruntime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a\nhigher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration\nand specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others\n(collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific\nsubset of experts (specialized). Our experiments reveal that most experts tend\nto be overly collaborative, leading to increased communication overhead from\nrepeatedly sending tokens to different accelerators. To this end, we propose a\nnovel collaboration-constrained routing (C2R) strategy to encourage more\nspecialized expert groups, as well as to improve expert utilization, and\npresent an efficient implementation of MoE that further leverages expert\nspecialization.

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency.

Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-02T06:40:09Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01887v1","title":"Dual mechanism of Anti-Seizure Medications in controlling seizure\n  activity","summary":"Background: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can reduce seizure duration, but\ntheir precise modes of action are unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether\nASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a\nshorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity\npatterns.\n  Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from\n28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure\noccurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns\n(states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these\nto different ASM levels.\n  Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency\n(r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p <\n0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct\nmechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:\n  Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering\nunmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these\n'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).\n  Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without\ntaper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224%\nlonger durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p\n< 0.001).\n  Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress\nspecific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and\n(ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight\nthe complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized\ndosing strategies for epilepsy management. These findings may also have\nimplications in understanding the effects of ASMs on cognition and mood.","main_category":"q-bio.NC","categories":"q-bio.NC","published":"2025-04-02T16:44:51Z"}

In this work, we introduce a novel framework,\nGAMLA (Global Analytical Manifold Learning using Auto-encoding). GAMLA employs\na two-round training process within an auto-encoding framework to derive both\ncharacter and complementary representations for the underlying manifold. With\nthe character representation, the manifold is represented by a parametric\nfunction which unfold the manifold to provide a global coordinate. While with\nthe complementary representation, an approximate explicit manifold description\nis developed, offering a global and analytical representation of smooth\nmanifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets. This enables the analytical\nderivation of geometric properties such as curvature and normal vectors.\nMoreover, we find the two representations together decompose the whole latent\nspace and can thus characterize the local spatial structure surrounding the\nmanifold, proving particularly effective in anomaly detection and\ncategorization. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and\nreal-world applications, GAMLA demonstrates its ability to achieve\ncomputational efficiency and interpretability while providing precise geometric\nand structural insights.

To simplify training, we focus on using many virtual environments for\ninexpensive, automatically collected interaction data. Genie, a recent\nmulti-environment world model, demonstrates simulation abilities of many\nenvironments with shared behavior. Unfortunately, training their model requires\nexpensive demonstrations. Therefore, we propose a training framework merely\nusing a random agent in virtual environments. While the model trained in this\nmanner exhibits good controls, it is limited by the random exploration\npossibilities. To address this limitation, we propose AutoExplore Agent - an\nexploration agent that entirely relies on the uncertainty of the world model,\ndelivering diverse data from which it can learn the best. Our agent is fully\nindependent of environment-specific rewards and thus adapts easily to new\nenvironments.

We model solar and Galactic CR transport through a post-impact early\nEarth atmosphere at 200Myr. We aim to identify the differences in the resulting\nionisation rates, $\\zeta$, particularly at the Earth's surface during a period\nwhen the Sun was very active. We use a Monte Carlo model to describe CR\ntransport through the early Earth atmosphere, giving the CR spectra as a\nfunction of altitude.

However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly\nand labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared\nimage capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored\nvisible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a\nstyle transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the\nmodality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited\ntraining data. In this paper, we propose F-ViTA, a novel approach that\nleverages the general world knowledge embedded in foundation models to guide\nthe diffusion process for improved translation. Specifically, we condition an\nInstructPix2Pix Diffusion Model with zero-shot masks and labels from foundation\nmodels such as SAM and Grounded DINO. This allows the model to learn meaningful\ncorrelations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared\nimagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Accordingly, we categorize\ndeepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face\nInconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from\nthe challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing\ninconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform\nsurrounding areas.

Despite\nprevious works endeavoring to address the fully-supervised single-view or\ncross-view dense video captioning, they lapse in the proposed unsupervised task\ndue to the significant inter-view gap caused by temporal misalignment and\nirrelevant object interference. Hence, we propose a Gaze Consensus-guided\nEgo-Exo Adaptation Network (GCEAN) that injects the gaze information into the\nlearned representations for the fine-grained alignment between the Ego and Exo\nviews. Specifically, the Score-based Adversarial Learning Module (SALM)\nincorporates a discriminative scoring network to learn unified view-invariant\nrepresentations for bridging distinct views from a global level. Then, the Gaze\nConsensus Construction Module (GCCM) utilizes gaze representations to\nprogressively calibrate the learned global view-invariant representations for\nextracting the video temporal contexts based on focusing regions. Moreover, the\ngaze consensus is constructed via hierarchical gaze-guided consistency losses\nto spatially and temporally align the source and target views.

The rationale for employing the concept of radial epiderivatives is\nthat they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for both identifying\nglobal descent directions and achieving global minimum of nonconvex and\nnondifferentiable functions. These properties of radial epiderivatives are\ncombined with line search methods to develop iterative solution algorithms. The\nproposed methods generate search directions at each iteration where global\ndescent directions and stopping criteria are performed by using the abilities\nof the radial epiderivatives. We use two line search methods, that is cyclic\ncoordinate and particle swarm optimization techniques to generate search\ndirections, selecting only those that exhibit descent, as determined by using\napproximately computed radial epiderivatives at the current point. As a\nparticular case, these methods are applied for minimizing concave functions. In\nthe paper, two convergence theorems are proved. One of them deals with the\ngeneral line search method and covers only the set of directions generated by\nthe method. The second convergence theorem deals with minimizing concave\nfunctions which deals not only with the generated set of directions but covers\nthe whole set of feasible solutions.

One\npopular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism\nknown as a dispute game for block proposals. In these systems, validators can\nchallenge blocks that they believe contain errors, and a successful challenge\nresults in the transfer of a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward. In\nthis paper, we reveal a structural vulnerability in the mechanism: validators\nmay not be awarded a proper profit despite winning a dispute challenge. We\ndevelop a formal game-theoretic model of the dispute game and analyze several\nscenarios, including cases where the proposer controls some validators and\ncases where a secondary auction mechanism is deployed to induce additional\nparticipation. Our analysis demonstrates that under current designs, the\ncompetitive pressure from validators may be insufficient to deter malicious\nbehavior. We find that increased validator competition, paradoxically driven by\nhigher rewards or participation, can allow a malicious proposer to\nsignificantly lower their net loss by capturing value through mechanisms like\nauctions. To address this, we propose countermeasures such as an escrowed\nreward mechanism and a commit-reveal protocol.

However, while MPC excels in planning and control,\nit lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in\ncomplex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce\nVision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation\nplanning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module\nthat takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to\ngenerate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video\nprediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In\naddition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video\nprediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on\nthe candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon\ntasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal\naction sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both\npixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and\nthe task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance\nin various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

The additional energy loss due to NMM\ncan significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the\nMESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in\nlow-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He\ncore mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical\n$Z = 1 Z_{\\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$, and $\\mu_v = 3 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\\sim 5\\%$, and the TRGB\nluminosity increases by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However,\ncontrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs\nearlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the\nadditional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core,\nreleases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the\nhydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass\nfaster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak\nluminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and\nsub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency.\nWe found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash\ncan induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot\nregion into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in\nNMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter\nthe surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment\neffect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW\nmixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to\neffectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-08T04:33:18Z"}

The present paper investigates the possible\nexistence of the PDR built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge\nnucleus using the phonon damping model (PDM) with and without pairing\ncorrelation at zero and finite temperatures. The results obtained within the\nPDM with exact pairing (EP+PDM) reveal the appearance of two enhanced\n$\\gamma$-transitions $E_\\gamma = 7.25$ and 7.35 MeV at $T=0.6$ MeV, which carry\nthe PDR nature and hence implying the possible existence of PDR built on\nexcited states in this nucleus. These two $\\gamma$-energies nicely match with a\nrecent experimental observation, thus indicating the crucial role of the\ninclusion of exact pairing solution in the precise description of low-lying\n$\\gamma$-transitions. The partition function-based analysis shows that this\npredicted PDR at $T=$ 0.6MeV is mainly contributed by the first $2^+$ excited\nstate of the $^{80}$Ge nucleus. The isospin mixing at the nuclear surface is\nalso observed in the investigated PDR at $T=0.6-0.7$ MeV. The primary mechanism\nunderlying the emergence of the hot PDR is found due to the coupling of GDR\nphonon to non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole configurations at\nfinite temperatures within the PDM framework, along with the shift in\nparticle-hole excitation energies due to thermal pairing correlations","main_category":"nucl-th","categories":"nucl-th","published":"2025-04-08T08:23:37Z"}

The alternative solutions correspond to poorly\nunderstood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z$\\sim$3-7.\nThis conclusion is supported by the analysis of a NIRSpec spectrum recently\nacquired by the CAPERS program for one interloper object, which is confirmed to\nbe a dusty ($E(B-V)=0.8$ mag) starburst galaxy at $z=6.56$. We measured the UV\nluminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level\nwithin our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed\nat $z\\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared\nto estimates at $z<15$, implying a significant tension with existing\ntheoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\\text{UV}}<-21$)\ncandidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In\nturn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude\nthat future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select\n$M_{\\text{UV}}\\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z>15$.

Although\nthis standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental\ndata, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics,\npostulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e.,\nindividual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers\nthis contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical\nquestion rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical\nstrongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on\none-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation\nof STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a\ntheoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going\nbeyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show\nwhy, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with\nexperimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and\nTersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate\ninterpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe\nthe process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of\nmany-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states.

Hybrid CPU-GPU\ninference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert\nloading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation\npatterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping\nstrategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU\nschedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes,\nstructures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that\nimproves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache\nmanagement system.

The method\nmimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences\nrather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such,\nPIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially\ntaking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness\npressure. However, it is still unclear how mating preferences affect the\noverall population and how dependent they are on set-up choices. In this work,\nwe tracked the evolution of individual preferences through different mutation\ntypes, searching for patterns and evidence of self-reinforcement. Results\nsuggest that mating preferences do not stand on their own, relying on subtree\nmutation to avoid convergence to single-node trees. Nevertheless, they\nconsistently promote smaller and more balanced solutions depth-wise than a\nstandard tournament selection, reducing the impact of bloat. Furthermore, when\ncoupled with subtree mutation it also results in more solution diversity with\nstatistically significant results.","main_category":"cs.NE","categories":"cs.NE","published":"2025-04-08T14:56:46Z"}

This gap in understanding stems largely from the lack of\ntheoretical tools for analyzing their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. To address\nthis challenge, we develop a system of approximate master equations that\ncapture the behavior of local search algorithms in constraint satisfaction\nproblems. Our framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with the phase\ndiagrams of two paradigmatic algorithms: Focused Metropolis Search (FMS) and\ngreedy-WalkSAT (G-WalkSAT) for random 3-SAT. The equations not only confirm the\nnumerical observation that G-WalkSAT's algorithmic threshold is nearly\nparameter-independent, but also successfully predict FMS's threshold beyond the\nclustering transition. We also exploit these equations in a decimation scheme,\ndemonstrating that the computed marginals encode valuable information about the\nlocal structure of the solution space explored by stochastic algorithms.\nNotably, our decimation approach achieves a threshold that surpasses the\nclustering transition, outperforming conventional methods like Belief\nPropagation-guided decimation. These results challenge the prevailing\nassumption that long-range correlations are always necessary to describe\nefficient local search dynamics and open a new path to designing efficient\nalgorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems.","main_category":"cond-mat.dis-nn","categories":"cond-mat.dis-nn","published":"2025-04-09T10:20:31Z"}

In this framework, the machine learning algorithm is guided by\nthe underlying physical laws, enabling the accurate extraction of the inverse\nscattering potential from the elastic scattering data. Methodology: As a\nreference potential, a combination of three smoothly joined Morse functions has\nbeen utilized, characterized by ten model parameters. These parameters are\noptimized in an iterative fashion using a Genetic Algorithm to ensure the best\nfit to the phase shifts extracted from the experimental scattering data.

Existing methods\non code watermarking, leveraging the idea from the backdoor research, embed\nstealthy triggers as watermarks.Despite their high resilience against dilution\nattacks and backdoor detections, the robustness has not been fully evaluated.\nTo fill this gap, we propose DeCoMa, a dual-channel approach to Detect and\npurify Code dataset waterMarks.To overcome the high barrier created by the\nstealthy and hidden nature of code watermarks, DeCoMa leverages dual-channel\nconstraints on code to generalize and map code samples into standardized\ntemplates. Subsequently, DeCoMa extracts hidden watermarks by identifying\noutlier associations between paired elements within the standardized templates.\nFinally, DeCoMa purifies the watermarked dataset by removing all samples\ncontaining the detected watermark, enabling the silent appropriation of\nprotected code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DeCoMa, covering 14 types of code watermarks and 3\nrepresentative intelligent code tasks (a total of 14 scenarios).

In particular, laser-based OWC networks can provide terabits per\nsecond (Tbps) aggregate data rates. However, the emerging OWC networks require\na high number of optical access points (APs), each AP corresponding to an\noptical cell, to provide uniform coverage for multiple users. Therefore,\ninter-cell interference (ICI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are crucial\nissues that must be managed efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. In\nradio frequency (RF) networks, rate splitting (RS) is proposed as a\ntransmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously following a certain\nstrategy. It was shown that RS provides high data rates compared to orthogonal\nand non-orthogonal interference management schemes. Considering the high\ndensity of OWC networks, the application of RS within each optical cell might\nnot be practical due to severe ICI. In this paper, a new strategy is derived\nreferred to as blind interference alignment-rate splitting (BIA-RS) to fully\ncoordinate the transmission among the optical APs, while determining the\nprecoding matrices of multiple groups of users formed beforehand. Therefore, RS\ncan be implemented within each group to manage MUI. The proposed BIA-RS scheme\nrequires two layers of power allocation to achieve high performance.

In this study, we thoroughly discuss\nthe enhancement of cosmic growth rate measurements facilitated by Fast Radio\nBursts, which probe the electron density of the universe along their\npropagation paths to provide crucial additional information on $P_{ge}$.\nSubsequently, we utilize future spectroscopic surveys from the Chinese Space\nStation Telescope and the CMB-S4 experiment, combined with FRB dispersion\nmeasures, to achieve precise measurements of the cosmic growth rate at\nredshifts $z_g = 0.15,0.45,0.75$. Employing Fisher matrix forecasting analysis,\nwe anticipate that constraints on $f\\sigma_8$ will reach a precision of 0.001\nwith a sample size of $10^6$ FRBs. Furthermore, we perform a global analysis\nusing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain key parameters of three\ndistinct dark energy models and a modified gravity model based on cosmic growth\nrate measurements. The results demonstrate that these refined $f\\sigma_8$\nmeasurements considerably enhance the constraints on relevant cosmological\nparameters compared to those obtained from Planck. As the number of observed\nFRBs increases, alongside more precise galaxy surveys and next-generation CMB\nobservations, new opportunities will arise for constraining cosmological models\nusing the kSZ effect and for developing novel cosmological applications of\nFRBs.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-04-10T05:10:15Z"}

Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying\nthe edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different\nforgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included\nin the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we\npresent an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL). Once\ntrained, our model can detect both seen and unseen forgeries, providing a more\npractical and efficient solution to counter false information in the era of\ngenerative AI. Our method focuses on learning general features from the\npristine content rather than traces of specific forgeries, which are relatively\nconsistent across different types of forgeries and therefore can be used as\nuniversal features to locate unseen forgeries. Additionally, as existing image\nforgery datasets are still dominated by traditional hand-crafted forgeries, we\nconstruct a new dataset consisting of images edited by various popular deep\ngenerative image editing methods to further encourage research in detecting\nimages manipulated by deep generative models. Extensive experimental results\nshow that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the\ndetection of unseen forgeries and also demonstrates competitive results for\nseen forgeries.

We prove that any such\nmetric $g$ forces the universal cover $(\\tM, \\tg)$ to split isometrically as a\nRiemannian product $(\\Hyp, g_0) \\times (\\R, c^2 du^2)$, where $(\\Hyp, g_0)$ is\nthe hyperbolic plane equipped with a complete $\\pi_1(\\Sigma)$-invariant metric\nand $c>0$ is a constant. This affirmatively resolves the question and extends\nrigidity theorems known for flat tori and manifolds of non-positive curvature.\nWe present two proofs: the main proof relies on the analysis of Busemann\nfunctions associated with the lifted $S^1$-action, while an alternative proof\nutilizes Jacobi field analysis along the flow lines of the corresponding\nKilling field. Both approaches show that the absence of conjugate points\ncompels the horizontal distribution orthogonal to the Killing field flow to be\nparallel and integrable, leading to a global isometric splitting via the de\nRham theorem. Several geometric and dynamical consequences follow from this\nrigid structure.","main_category":"math.DG","categories":"math.DG","published":"2025-04-10T10:05:48Z"}

The cause of such outbursts is\nbelieved to be thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disc. However, some\nof these transient sources show unusually long outbursts. For example, EXO\n0748-676 remained in outburst for at least 23 years before entering a\nquiescence, only to re-emerge 16 years later. We aim to investigate if such\nlong outbursts could be due to the usual disc instability, or if any other\nmechanism is required. In order to address this question, we systematically\ncompare various properties of long outburst and short outburst NS LMXBs. For\nthis, we analyze the long-term X-ray light curves of many short orbital period\n(hours) NS LMXBs, examining the outburst duration and the inferred accretion\nrate, and estimate the accretion disc mass. Our study shows that long outburst\nsources are well-separated from the short outburst ones in parameter spaces\ninvolving accretion rate, disc mass, outburst duration, etc. in four ways. This\nimplies that the thermal-viscous instability in the disc cannot explain the\nlong outbursts, but could explain the short ones. Moreover, we discuss that\nboth donor star related and disc related models have difficulties in explaining\nlong outbursts.

However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the\nsubtlety of actions. To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised\nMAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled. We first evaluate\ntraditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these\nmethods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error\naccumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the\ncommon practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as\npseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which\nexplicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the\noffline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.\nMoreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically\nfilter noisy labels of different classes. We then build a memory-based\nprototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and\nused to guide the subsequent model training phase. By alternating the two\npseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model\ncan not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the\noverfitting issue.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07919v1","title":"Double White Dwarf Tides with Multi-messenger Measurements","summary":"Short-period Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) systems will be observable\nboth in visible light through photometric monitoring and in mHz-range\ngravitational waves (GWs) with forthcoming space-based laser interferometry\nsuch as LISA. When only photometric variability is used to measure DWD\nintrinsic properties, there is a degeneracy between the chirp mass and binary\ntidal interaction, as orbital frequency time derivative is set by both GW\nradiation and tides. Without expensive radial velocity data from spectroscopic\nmonitoring, this degeneracy may be lifted in principle by directly measuring\nthe second time derivative of the orbital frequency through photometric\nmonitoring over an ultra-long time baseline. Alternatively, the degeneracy can\nbe removed by exploiting information in both photometric variability and the\ncoherent GW waveform. Investigating both approaches, we find that direct\nmeasurement of the second time derivative is likely infeasible for most DWDs,\nwhile the multi-messenger method will disentangle measurements of the chirp\nmass and the binary moments of inertia, for a large sample of tidally locked\nsystems. The latter information will enable empirical tests of WD structure\nmodels with finite temperature effects.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-10T17:33:52Z"}

In the realm of the Effective Field\nTheory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic\nLagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations.\nSince gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, this procedure is performed\nperturbatively in terms of negative powers of the EFT strong coupling scales.\nSince the interactions we consider are purely gravitational, they are\nubiquitous and independent of the details of the EFT. Our results are thus\nrelevant for a large class of approximately scale-invariant inflationary\nscenarios, be them driven by a single scalar field with canonical kinetic\nterms, or with a non-canonical structure \\textit{\\`a la} $P(X,\\phi)$, or for an\neffective single-field description at the level of fluctuations only and\nemerging from a covariant multifield theory. Using dimensional regularization,\nwe show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop\nlevel can be canceled at all times by an appropriate splitting of the bare\nLagrangian into renormalized operators and counterterms. Moreover, we\nexplicitly compute all finite contributions to the loops and we prove that,\ntaking into account backreaction, the final one-loop renormalized power spectra\nof both the primordial curvature perturbation and of gravitational waves are\nexactly conserved on super-horizon scales. Conclusions of our work imply that\nthe scalar and tensor propagation speeds are immune to radiative corrections\nfrom gravitational nonlinearities. We discuss a first application to multifield\ninflation.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th","published":"2025-04-10T17:41:58Z"}

Existing 3D part segmentation\nmethods only identify visible surface patches, limiting their utility. Inspired\nby 2D amodal segmentation, we introduce this novel task to the 3D domain and\npropose a practical, two-stage approach, addressing the key challenges of\ninferring occluded 3D geometry, maintaining global shape consistency, and\nhandling diverse shapes with limited training data. First, we leverage existing\n3D part segmentation to obtain initial, incomplete part segments. Second, we\nintroduce HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model, to complete these segments\ninto full 3D parts. HoloPart utilizes a specialized architecture with local\nattention to capture fine-grained part geometry and global shape context\nattention to ensure overall shape consistency. We introduce new benchmarks\nbased on the ABO and PartObjaverse-Tiny datasets and demonstrate that HoloPart\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art shape completion methods. By\nincorporating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, we achieve\npromising results on 3D part amodal segmentation, opening new avenues for\napplications in geometry editing, animation, and material assignment.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-10T17:53:31Z"}

Current approaches\ninvolve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting\nvision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such\napproaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question\nwhether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work,\nwe revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those\ntrained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling\nlaws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and\ntraining mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to\nlate-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image\nencoders. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower\nparameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy.\nMotivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show\nthat incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows for models that learn\nmodality-specific weights, significantly enhancing performance.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-10T17:57:28Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07952v1","title":"Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory","summary":"Despite their impressive performance on complex tasks, current language\nmodels (LMs) typically operate in a vacuum: Each input query is processed\nseparately, without retaining insights from previous attempts. Here, we present\nDynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM\nwith a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or\nre-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and\nreuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving\ninsights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance\nsubstantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth\nlabels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than\ndoubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across\nquestions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to\n99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks\nprone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o\nand Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated\ncode, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic\nchallenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks.\nClaude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro\nproblems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise,\ntransferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or\nstatic retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly,\nwithout modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC\nas a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the\ndivide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven\nlearning characteristic of human cognition.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-10T17:57:33Z"}
