This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are\npromising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward\ngeneral-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-03-27T16:35:02Z"}

The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their\npositions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could\nsignificantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this\npotential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional,\ncomplex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within\na rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and\ncrescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its\nplacement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant\nfrequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of\ninternal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node\ngeneration. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect\nratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the\nchannel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor,\nwhich is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic\nenergy per cycle. We show that additional nodes emerge in the presence of a\nscatterer, but they come at the cost of reduced acoustic pressure and energy in\nthe channel.

Evaluations are critical to assess progress and\nbuild better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale\nthat would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human\ntime and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies\nrequires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making\nthe evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation\nof robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to\nautonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal\nhuman intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs\nto the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster\nscheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation\nwithin a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene\nresets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in\nthe evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the\nevaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by\nhand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics\ncommunity, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular\nBridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms.

In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning\nmethod named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards\npropagation.

We\nbelieve this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of\ngradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical\nrepresentations -- at least not in the usual sense.

To\ntackle this challenge, we develop the topological prior (TP), a new prior\nconstructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent\npairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions\nunder reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure\nand discontinuities of the function. The TP prior, however, only exists in a\ndiscretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior\nmeasure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a TP-Gaussian\nhybrid prior, where the TP component detects sharp discontinuities in the\nfunction, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring\na well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed TP prior\ndemonstrates effects similar to the classical total variation (TV) prior but\noffers greater flexibility and broader applicability due to three key\nadvantages. First, it is defined on a general topological space, making it\neasily adaptable to a wider range of applications. Second, the persistent\ndistance captures richer topological information compared to the discrete TV\nprior.

The two populations\nshow different chemical trends: one exhibits low metallicities and high\n$\\alpha$ abundances, and the other shows high metallicities and low $\\alpha$\nabundances, which is associated with the recently discovered Nereus and Virgo\nRadial Merger (VRM) components in the local stellar halo, respectively. The\nNereus component in these overdensities uniquely exhibits a decreasing trend in\nthe [Fe/H]-[Mn/Fe] plane. Out of all observed Milky Way dwarf galaxies, this\ntrend is only found in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy, which provides clues for the\nproperties of Nereus progenitor. We also find that the velocity ellipse with\nhigh aniostropy parameters that is usually considered to be part of GSE are\nactually a mix of the two components.

For example, this issue\noften limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to\ntrain multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive\nrollout of a single-step model. However, it is not well understood when the\nbenefits of multi-step prediction outweigh the added complexity of learning a\nmore complicated model. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of this\ntrade-off in the context of linear dynamical systems. We show that when the\nmodel class is well-specified and accurately captures the system dynamics,\nsingle-step models achieve lower asymptotic prediction error. On the other\nhand, when the model class is misspecified due to partial observability, direct\nmulti-step predictors can significantly reduce bias and thus outperform\nsingle-step approaches. These theoretical results are supported by numerical\nexperiments, wherein we also (a) empirically evaluate an intermediate strategy\nwhich trains a single-step model using a multi-step loss and (b) evaluate\nperformance of single step and multi-step predictors in a closed loop control\nsetting.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.LG,cs.SY","published":"2025-04-02T14:18:52Z"}

Our approach involves a comprehensive\nanalysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and\nutterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of\nstate-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature\nextraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion\ntechniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM)\npredictions.

Our primary\nobjective is to predict the movies that a user would be interested in watching,\ni.e. predict their watchlist. To construct this extension, we recruited\nMovieLens users, collected their profiles, made recommendations with a diverse\nset of algorithms, pooled the recommendations, and had the users assess the\npools. Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of\nevaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total\nnumber of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation\nruns we used to build the pools. In contrast, when we rank the runs by users'\ninterest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a\nrecommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs. It appears\nthat by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate\nthe popularity bias issues created by using information retrieval effectiveness\nmeasures for the evaluation of recommender systems.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-02T16:15:46Z"}

(2024a) computed the\nLMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that\nthe LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly\ncounter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of\n$\\Omega_p = -1.0 \\pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar\npattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal\nfinite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results:\nIn the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like\ngalaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that\nsuffers a slowdown from $\\Omega_p \\sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\\Omega_p \\sim 0$\nkm/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\\Omega_p \\sim\n3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before\ninteraction) pattern speed of $\\Omega_p \\sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the\nK21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct\nevidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal\ninteraction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a\nnon-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed\nslow-rotating bars.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-02T16:24:01Z"}

But\nthe number of binaries identified with this method is not a good approximation\nto the number of binaries in the original sample due to the low detection\nefficiency of binaries with mass ratios smaller than 0.20 or larger than 0.80.\nTherefore, we have improved this point by using the detection efficiencies of\nour method and an empirical mass ratio distribution and then can infer the\nbinary fraction in the sample.

In PT-VQE, VQE is used\nto capture key correlations within a carefully selected active space, while\nperturbation theory efficiently incorporates interactions in the remaining\nspace, without requiring additional qubits or circuit depth. When the\nVQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active\nspace, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their\ncontributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the\nhighest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs.

In the present\narticle, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and\nwas already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical\ncontradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost\nentirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may\nsurprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much\nof which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out\nsupposed internal contradictions. Like the first paradox, this one arises from\nthe premise of a universe entirely filled with polyhedra. However, in this\ncase, the contradiction stems from the absence of void outside it. In the first\nsection, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect\nmathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and\nhollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support\nthe necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect\nmathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot\nmove at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction\nin Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier\napparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living\nbeing, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and\nreforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues\nconcerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of\nobservations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between\nintelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of\nPlato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal'\ninterpretation.

On\nthe other hand, centralized approaches have a single point of failure. Thus, is\nthere some way to combine their advantages without inheriting their\ndisadvantages? To that end, we consider a supervised peer-to-peer approach\nwhere the peers can ask a potentially unreliable supervisor for advice. This is\nin line with the increasingly popular algorithmic paradigm called algorithms\nwith predictions or learning-augmented algorithms, but we are the first to\nconsider it in the context of peer-to-peer networks.\n  Specifically, we design self-stabilizing algorithms for the fundamental\nproblem of distributed graph linearization, where peers are supposed to recover\nthe \"sorted line\" network from any initial network after a transient fault.\nWith the help of the supervisor, peers can recover the sorted line network in\n$O(\\log n)$ time, if the advice is correct; otherwise, the algorithm retains\nits original recovery time (i.e., without any supervisor). A crucial challenge\nthat we overcome is to correctly compose multiple self-stabilizing algorithms,\nthat is, one that processes and exploits the advice, and another that does not\nrely on the advice at all. Our key technical contributions combine ideas from\nthe fields of overlay networks and proof-labeling schemes. Finally, we give a\nmatching lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ for the recovery time of any algorithm\nif the advice can be corrupted, where $n$ is the network size.","main_category":"cs.DC","categories":"cs.DC","published":"2025-04-03T10:07:41Z"}

To address this\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\nglobal path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is\ndesigned with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations\nthat occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the\nrobot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter.

The majority of existing core flow models are global,\nshowing features such as an eccentric planetary gyre, with some evidence of\nrapid regional changes. By construction, the flow defined at any location by\nsuch a model depends on all magnetic field variations across the entire\ncore-mantle boundary making it challenging to interpret local structures in the\nflow as due to specific local changes in magnetic field. Here we present an\nalternative strategy in which we construct regional flow models that rely only\non local secular changes. We use a novel technique based on machine learning\ntermed Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), in which we seek a regional\nflow model that simultaneously fits both the local magnetic field variation and\ndynamical conditions assumed satisfied by the flow. Although we present results\nusing the Tangentially Geostrophic flow constraint, we set out a modelling\nframework for which the physics constraint can be easily changed by altering a\nsingle line of code. After validating the PINN-based method on synthetic flows,\nwe apply our method to the CHAOS-8.1 geomagnetic field model, itself based on\ndata from Swarm. Constructing a global mosaic of regional flows, we reproduce\nthe planetary gyre, providing independent evidence that the strong secular\nchanges at high latitude and in equatorial regions are part of the same global\nfeature. Our models also corroborate regional changes in core flows over the\nlast decade. Furthermore, our models endorse the existence of a dynamic high\nlatitude jet, which began accelerating around 2005 but has been weakening since\n2017.","main_category":"physics.geo-ph","categories":"physics.geo-ph","published":"2025-04-03T13:27:45Z"}

The two popular\nframeworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard\nmodel effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory\n(HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new\nphysics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken\nsymmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a\nsinglet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase\neffective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate\nfields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear\nrealization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our\napproach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level,\nwe compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector\nboson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung\nprocess at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT\nreproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the\nregions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the\nelectroweak scale. Therefore, the bEFT serves as a useful framework that can\ncompensate for the shortcomings in both the SMEFT and the HEFT when dealing\nwith UV models that involve Higgs mixing or new particles with a mass close to\nthe electroweak scale.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph","published":"2025-04-03T13:42:49Z"}

For this aim, we rely on projection-based model\norder reduction (MOR), i.e., we approximate the large-scale problem by\nprojecting it onto a suitable subspace and reducing it to one of a much smaller\ndimension. Such a subspace is constructed by means of weak greedy-type\nstrategies. After detailing the connections with the reduced basis method for\nsource problems, we introduce a novel error estimate for the approximation\nerror related to the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since\nthe difference between the second smallest and the smallest eigenvalue, the\nso-called spectral gap, is crucial for the reliability of the error estimate,\nwe propose efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for higher eigenvalues\nand for the spectral gap, which enable the assembly of a subspace for the MOR\napproximation of the spectral gap.

Until recently, this question was considered open. However, in\n[M.-O. Renou et al, Nature 600, 625-629, 2021], a decisive argument was\npresented asserting that quantum theory needs complex numbers. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a formulation of quantum theory based solely on real numbers\nis indeed possible while retaining key features such as theory-representation\nlocality (i.e. local physical operations are represented by local changes to\nthe states) and the positive semi-definiteness of its states and effects. We\nobserve that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was\nderived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By\nstarting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive\na combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties\nanalogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory. We also prove that\nthe conventional tensor product rule can also lead to a real and\nrepresentation-local theory, albeit with a modified characterization of the\nstate space. We thus conclude that complex numbers are a mere convenience in\nquantum theory.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-03T17:53:19Z"}

Besides, they treat all unlabelled samples uniformly, neglecting\nvariations in certainty levels and resulting in suboptimal learning. Moreover,\nthe explicit identification of semantic distribution shifts between known and\nunknown classes, a vital aspect for effective GCD, has been neglected. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce DebGCD, a \\underline{Deb}iased learning\nwith distribution guidance framework for \\underline{GCD}. Initially, DebGCD\nco-trains an auxiliary debiased classifier in the same feature space as the GCD\nclassifier, progressively enhancing the GCD features. Moreover, we introduce a\nsemantic distribution detector in a separate feature space to implicitly boost\nthe learning efficacy of GCD. Additionally, we employ a curriculum learning\nstrategy based on semantic distribution certainty to steer the debiased\nlearning at an optimized pace. Thorough evaluations on GCD benchmarks\ndemonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of our framework,\nhighlighting its superiority.

In practice, a target might come from far distance or with\nultra-high speed. However, the max unambiguous range and max tolerable velocity\nof OTFS-ISAC system is limited by the unambiguous round-trip delay and Doppler\nshift, which are related to OTFS frame, i.e., time slots and subcarrier\nspacing, respectively. To enlarge the sensing range, a novel OTFS cross-frame\nranging and velocity estimation model as well as its corresponding method based\non the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) are proposed in this paper. By designing\nco-prime numbers of subcarriers and time slots in different subframes, the\ndifference in the responses of the subframes for a target can be used to\nestimate the distance and velocity of an out-of-range target.

We\naddress the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by\nproposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision\ntransformers rooted in evidential learning.

Existed methods for shifting the\nfrequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect,\nhowever, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz,\nfurthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of\na photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the\nfrequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is\nusually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between\nthese methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter\nbased on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a\nfrequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap. As a\nprinciple of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading\nprocess, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and\nthe shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency\ndifference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence\nratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the\npreserve of quantum properties. The present quantum frequency shifter is in\nanalog to an electro-optical based shifter, but with much broader tuning\nability. Our all-optical quantum frequency shifter will become a fundamental\nbuilding block for high-speed quantum communication networks and frequency\ndomain photonic quantum computation.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,physics.optics","published":"2025-04-07T11:47:57Z"}

This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and\n$f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of\nassessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard\ngravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the\ngrowth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by\nimplementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration\nspace, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis\ndemonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by\nnon-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\\beta$\nparameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small\n(non-linear) scales. We show that this estimator can be accurately measured\nusing mock galaxies in low redshift bins ($z < 1$), where it offers strong\ndiscriminating power over competing gravity theories. We find that, for an\nall-sky galaxy survey and neglecting observational systematics, accurate and\nlargely unbiased estimations of $E_G$ can be obtained across all redshifts.\nHowever, the error bars are too large to clearly distinguish between the\ntheories. When measuring the scale-dependence of the $E_G$ estimator, we note\nthat state-of-the-art theory modeling limitations and intrinsic \"prior volume\neffects\" prevent high-accuracy constraints. Alternatively, we propose a null\ntest of gravity using RSD clustering, which, if small scales are modeled\naccurately in future surveys, could detect significant departures from GR.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-04-07T11:49:43Z"}

Traditional\nfederated edge computing (EC) methods require frequent central communication,\nconsuming substantial energy and struggling with resource heterogeneity across\ndevices, networks, and data.

However, limited attention has been given to the\ninterpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In\naddition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their\nown homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered,\nand an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering\n(IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is\nfully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples\nare grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors\nof all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the\nclusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making\nprocess of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices\nare introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by\ncapturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different\nstyles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data\nrepresentation capability.

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle\nmultiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential.\nHowever, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather\nconditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world\ndegradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with\ndegradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed\nDA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive\ndegradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration.\nSpecifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware\nrepresentations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space.\nBy aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each\nprompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The\nlearned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed\nweather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple\nweather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather\ndegradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a\ndynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of\nrestoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion\nmodel to restore diverse degradations adaptively.

As FL gains popularity, clients may need to train\nmultiple unrelated FL models, but communication constraints limit their ability\nto train all models simultaneously. While clients could train FL models\nsequentially, opportunistically having FL clients concurrently train different\nmodels -- termed multi-model federated learning (MMFL) -- can reduce the\noverall training time.

Advancements along this latter relevant direction\nare currently undermined by the lack of a multi-country model capable of\nincorporating the core structures of age-period mortality surfaces together\nwith clustering patterns among countries that are not global, but rather vary\nlocally across different combinations of ages and periods. We cover this gap by\ndeveloping a novel Bayesian model for log-mortality rates that characterizes\nthe age structure of mortality through a B-spline expansion whose\ncountry-specific dynamic coefficients encode both changes of this age structure\nacross periods and also local clustering patterns among countries under a\ntime-dependent random partition prior for these country-specific dynamic\ncoefficients.

As there are various\nreasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this\nmodel to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is\nuncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could\nbe made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this\nwork, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low\nmodel competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures\nconfidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate\nhigh-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD),\nFeature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent\nGradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these\nmethods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for\nlow model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising\nmethods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three\nmethods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nto generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the\ninclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly\nincreases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the\ncause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual\nimages in explaining low perception model competency.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-07T16:46:52Z"}

Specifically, our method\nfirst learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both\ndynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a\nunified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module\nfor dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and\nenhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable\nmatching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the\nproposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the\nremarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth\nestimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

The\ncomplexity of their progenitor systems, explosion physics and intrinsic\ndiversity poses not only challenges for their understanding as astrophysical\nobjects, but also for their standardization and use as cosmological probes.\nNear-infrared (NIR) observations offer a promising avenue for studying the\nphysics of SNeIa and for reducing systematic uncertainties in distance\nestimations, as they exhibit lower dust extinction and smaller dispersion in\npeak luminosity than optical bands. Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is\napplied to a sample of SNeIa with well-sampled NIR (YJH-band) light curves to\nidentify the dominant components of their variability and constrain physical\nunderlying properties. The theoretical models of Kasen2006 are used for the\nphysical interpretation of the PCA components, where we found the 56Ni mass to\ndescribe the dominant variability. Other factors, such as mixing and\nmetallicity, were found to contribute significantly as well. However, some\ndifferences are found between the components of the NIR bands which may be\nattributed to differences in the explosion aspects they each trace.\nAdditionally, the PCA components are compared to various light-curve\nparameters, identifying strong correlations between some components and peak\nbrightness in both the NIR and optical bands, particularly in the Y band. When\napplying PCA to NIR color curves, we found interesting correlations with the\nhost-galaxy mass, where SNeIa with redder NIR colors are predominantly found in\nless massive galaxies.

The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high\nmomentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and\nspin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a\nlinear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits\nspin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and\nnext-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other\nruthenate trimers in this series.

Most\nexisting methods aim to bridge this gap by aligning features across source and\ntarget domains but often fail to account for visual differences, such as color\nor orientation, in alignment pairs. This limitation leads to less effective\ndomain adaptation, as the model struggles to manage both domain-specific shifts\n(e.g., fog) and visual variations simultaneously. In this work, we demonstrate\nfor the first time, using a custom-built dataset, that aligning visually\nsimilar pairs significantly improves domain adaptation. Based on this insight,\nwe propose a novel memory-based system to enhance domain alignment. This system\nstores precomputed features of foreground objects and background areas from the\nsource domain, which are periodically updated during training. By retrieving\nvisually similar source features for alignment with target foreground and\nbackground features, the model effectively addresses domain-specific\ndifferences while reducing the impact of visual variations. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse domain shift scenarios validate our method's\neffectiveness, achieving 53.1 mAP on Foggy Cityscapes and 62.3 on Sim10k,\nsurpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by 1.2 and 4.1 mAP, respectively.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-09T06:11:11Z"}

Therefore, empirical\napproaches modeling galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo\nproperty cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations.

We have observed this\nissue is exacerbated in high-contented workloads at Tencent, where lock\ncontention can severely degrade system performance.

One way to quantify\nclass hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples\nrequired to effectively learn a given class. Sample complexity theory suggests\nthat class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for\ngeneralization. That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to\nachieve generalization. Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising\napproach to mitigate these performance disparities. While resampling has been\nstudied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced\ndatasets remains unexplored.\n  This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because\nit addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance. We begin addressing this\nquestion by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its\neffect on performance disparities. We oversample hard classes and undersample\neasy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity\nrequirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness. We\nestimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness\nestimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios. Using these ratios, we\nperform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets.\n  Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based\nresampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities. To\nexplain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key\nchallenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from\ntraditional data-based imbalance. Our insights help explain why theoretical\nsample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance\ngains and we provide guidelines for future research.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T16:45:57Z"}

This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud\nadjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also\ntemporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar\nheating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited.\nHere, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the\ncloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted\nclouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to\nautomatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud\nadjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended\nnighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast,\nliquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally\ndecrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most\nof these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from\ndifferences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud\nfraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1\nto -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal\nvariations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may\npartially offset it. These findings underscore the importance of diel\nvariations in aerosol cloud interactions.

However,\nthe high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the\ninference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory\n(CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache\npruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a\nfixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer\nfrom either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we\npropose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory\n(CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous\nsupport for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM\nmode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for\ndynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain\nCIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity\nscore, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the\ncurrent-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset\nof selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that\nleverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage\nof the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental\nresults, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP)\nby 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit\nlevel, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the\napplication level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM\ninference.","main_category":"cs.AR","categories":"cs.AR","published":"2025-04-10T06:13:30Z"}

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program\ntest suites.","main_category":"cs.PL","categories":"cs.PL,cs.SE","published":"2025-04-10T06:25:17Z"}

This\nrequires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human\nbehaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are\nperceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots\nshould strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if\nhumans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed \"long\nshort-term intention prediction\". This task requires robots can predict the\nlong-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short\nterm intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention.\nMeanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the\nshort-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and\nsuggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention\nmodel to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train\nthis intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the\nintention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based\nlong-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing\nthe consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist\nrobots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and\nshort-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term\nand short-term intentions of humans.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-10T09:50:18Z"}

Unforeseen\nfluctuations in earnings pose challenges in financial planning, affecting\ndecisions on savings and spending and ultimately undermining individuals'\nlong-term financial stability and well-being.\n  This issue is particularly evident in sectors where workers experience\nfrequently changing schedules without sufficient notice, including those in the\nfood service and retail sectors, part-time and hourly workers, and individuals\nwith lower incomes. These groups are already more financially vulnerable, and\nthe unpredictable nature of their schedules exacerbates their financial\nfragility.\n  Our objective is to understand how unforeseen fluctuations in earnings\nexacerbate financial fragility by investigating the extent to which\nindividuals' financial management depends on their ability to anticipate and\nplan for the future. To address this question, we develop a simulation\nframework that models how individuals optimize utility amidst financial\nuncertainty and the imperative to avoid financial ruin.

Understanding the effects of RL\nfine-tuning requires disentangling its interaction with pretraining data\ncomposition, hyperparameters, and model scale, but such problems are\nexacerbated by the lack of transparency regarding the training data used in\nmany existing models.
