Here, we propose using\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\ndynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and\nanisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other\nexchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by\n$45^\\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a\nDirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions.

Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM,\nwhich supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises\nthe final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view\nthat PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance\nusing an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still\nstruggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g.,\nmathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the\nperformance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data\nutilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the\nMLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses\nimage condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO\ntraining. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves\ndata utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying\ndifficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating\nthe token prediction logits with image condition in test-time.

CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in stages.\nThe initial 380 GeV stage, with a site length of 11 km, optimally combines the\nexploration of Higgs and top-quark physics, including a top threshold scan near\n350 GeV. A higher-energy stage, still using the initial single drive-beam\ncomplex, can be optimised for any energy up to 2 TeV.

Since the 2018\nESPPU reporting, significant effort was invested in CLIC accelerator\noptimisation, technology developments and system tests, including collaboration\nwith new-generation light sources and free-electron lasers. CLIC implementation\naspects at CERN have covered detailed studies of civil engineering, electrical\nnetworks, cooling and ventilation, scheduling, and costing. The CLIC baseline\nat 380 GeV is now 100 Hz operation, with a luminosity of 4.5$\\times\n10^{34}$\\,cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and a power consumption of 166 MW. Compared to the\n2018 design, this gives three times higher luminosity-per-power. The new\nbaseline has two beam-delivery systems, allowing for two detectors operating in\nparallel. The cost estimate of the 380 GeV baseline is approximately 7.17\nbillion CHF. The construction of the first CLIC energy stage could start as\nearly as 2033 with first beams available by 2041.

In this work, we address the challenge by introducing\ntwo-dimensional code+data space versioning for computational notebooks and\nverifying its effectiveness using our prototype system, Kishuboard, which\nintegrates with Jupyter. By adjusting code and data knobs, users of Kishuboard\ncan intuitively manage the state of computational notebooks in a flexible way,\nthereby achieving both execution rollbacks and checkouts across complex\nmulti-branch exploration history. Moreover, this two-dimensional versioning\nmechanism can easily be presented along with a friendly one-dimensional\nhistory. Human subject studies indicate that Kishuboard significantly enhances\nuser productivity in various data science tasks.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC","published":"2025-04-02T05:26:51Z"}

For example,\nmodern network telemetry systems that take advantage of existing data plane\ntechnologies for line rate traffic monitoring and processing cannot afford to\nwaste precious data plane resources on traffic that comes from \"uninteresting\"\nregions of the IP address space. However, there is currently no\nwell-established structural model or analysis toolbox that enables a\nfirst-principles approach to the specific problem of identifying\n\"uninteresting\" regions of the address space or the myriad of other networking\nproblems that prominently feature IP addresses.\n  To address this key missing piece, we present in this paper a\nfirst-of-its-kind empirically validated physical explanation for why the\nobserved IP address structure in measured Internet traffic is multifractal in\nnature. Our root cause analysis overcomes key limitations of mostly forgotten\nfindings from ~20 years ago and demonstrates that the Internet processes and\nmechanisms responsible for how IP addresses are allocated, assigned, and used\nin today's Internet are consistent with and well modeled by a class of\nevocative mathematical models called conservative cascades. We complement this\nroot cause analysis with the development of an improved toolbox that is\ntailor-made for analyzing finite and discrete sets of IP addresses and includes\nstatistical estimators that engender high confidence in the inferences they\nproduce. We illustrate the use of this toolbox in the context of a novel\naddress structure anomaly detection method we designed and conclude with a\ndiscussion of a range of challenging open networking problems that are\nmotivated or inspired by our findings.","main_category":"cs.NI","categories":"cs.NI","published":"2025-04-02T05:36:10Z"}

Determining the\ncollective excitation spectrum through Bogoliubov-de-Gennes theory, we\ncharacterize the dynamical stability regime via modulational instability. For\nAFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and\nunstable avoided crossings (UAC), with the first-excited branch undergoing a\ndouble unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions,\nonly a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited\nbranches, is observed. Furthermore, the eigenvectors demonstrate the transition\nfrom density-like to spin-like behaviour, as the collective excitation shows\nthe transition from stable to unstable mode for both the FM and AFM\ninteractions. In the multi-band instability state, eigenvectors display\nspin-density mixed mode, while they show spin-flip nature in the avoided\ncrossing regime. Our analysis suggests that spin-orbit coupling enhances the\ninstability gain, while Rabi coupling plays the opposite role. Finally, we\ncorroborate our analytical findings of stable and unstable regimes through\nnumerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of the condensates by\nintroducing the perturbations upon quenching the trap strength.

However, its real-world application often fails due to a\nlack of user acceptance and trust. A possible remedy is to provide managers\nwith the possibility of altering the RL policy by incorporating human expert\nknowledge. In this study, we analyze the benefits and caveats of including\nhuman knowledge via action masking. While action masking has so far been used\nto exclude invalid actions, its ability to integrate human expertise remains\nunderexplored. Human knowledge is often encapsulated in heuristics, which\nsuggest reasonable, near-optimal actions in certain situations. Enforcing such\nactions should hence increase trust among the human workforce to rely on the\nmodel's decisions. Yet, a strict enforcement of heuristic actions may also\nrestrict the policy from exploring superior actions, thereby leading to overall\nlower performance. We analyze the effects of action masking based on three\nproblems with different characteristics, namely, paint shop scheduling, peak\nload management, and inventory management. Our findings demonstrate that\nincorporating human knowledge through action masking can achieve substantial\nimprovements over policies trained without action masking. In addition, we find\nthat action masking is crucial for learning effective policies in constrained\naction spaces, where certain actions can only be performed a limited number of\ntimes.

In particular, preserved chiral\nsymmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in\ndetermining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in\nnon-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological\ninvariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The\ncorresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs\nto be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental\nefforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the\nbulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system\nwith chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum\nwalks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we\nexperimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall\nstructure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The\nappearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced\nnon-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair.

Prior work used the DeepLesion\ndataset (4,427 patients, 10,594 studies, 32,120 CT slices, 32,735 lesions, 8\nbody part labels) for algorithmic development, but this dataset is not\ncompletely annotated and contains class imbalances. To address these issues, in\nthis work, we developed a self-training pipeline for ULDT. A VFNet model was\ntrained on a limited 11.5\\% subset of DeepLesion (bounding boxes + tags) to\ndetect and classify lesions in CT studies. Then, it identified and incorporated\nnovel lesion candidates from a larger unseen data subset into its training set,\nand self-trained itself over multiple rounds. Multiple self-training\nexperiments were conducted with different threshold policies to select\npredicted lesions with higher quality and cover the class imbalances. We\ndiscovered that direct self-training improved the sensitivities of\nover-represented lesion classes at the expense of under-represented classes.\nHowever, upsampling the lesions mined during self-training along with a\nvariable threshold policy yielded a 6.5\\% increase in sensitivity at 4 FP in\ncontrast to self-training without class balancing (72\\% vs 78.5\\%) and a 11.7\\%\nincrease compared to the same self-training policy without upsampling (66.8\\%\nvs 78.5\\%).

The Standard Model\nLagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative\npoint of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect\nthis criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable.\nThe aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict\nrenormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity.\nFirst, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert\naction gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic\ngravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most\nconservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly\npredictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in\nthe sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to\nthe CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological\npredictions that can be tested in the near future.

Among various guidance strategies presented in literature,\nlook-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant\nattention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low\ncross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded\nlateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes\nproblematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce\nhigher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high\nvariation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of\nlook-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance\nstrategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized\n$L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference\npath in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the\nvehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of\ncorrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to\ngenerate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root\nmean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance\nstrategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the\nconventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and\nmeasures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration\nrequirements.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-04-08T12:31:19Z"}

Efficiently utilizing\nthese units requires a fundamentally different programming style than previous\narchitectures; programmers must now develop warp-specialized kernels that\norchestrate producer-consumer pipelines between the asynchronous units. To\nmanage the complexity of programming these new architectures, we introduce\nCypress, a task-based programming model with sequential semantics. Cypress\nprograms are a set of designated functions called \\emph{tasks} that operate on\n\\emph{tensors} and are free of communication and synchronization. Cypress\nprograms are bound to the target machine through a \\emph{mapping} specification\nthat describes where tasks should run and in which memories tensors should be\nmaterialized. We present a compiler architecture that lowers Cypress programs\ninto CUDA programs that perform competitively with expert-written codes.\nCypress achieves 0.88x-1.06x the performance of cuBLAS on GEMM, and between\n0.80x-0.98x the performance of the currently best-known Flash Attention\nimplementation while eliminating all aspects of explicit data movement and\nasynchronous computation from application code.","main_category":"cs.PL","categories":"cs.PL","published":"2025-04-09T16:24:15Z"}

Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling\nsequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.\nHowever, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel\nsampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates\ndiverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential\nsearch, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute\nbudget remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these\ntwo approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.\nSurprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on\nCountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not\nuniversally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to\ndegrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into\nsuboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage\n\"implicit\" (non-verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement\nlearning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit\nsignificantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see\nlimited, mixed gains.

Many previous SPH porous\nflow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid\ninterface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid\nand solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows\nus to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account\nand results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can\nsimulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid\nand solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit\nforces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces. These\nwe solve as a linear system and strongly couple with fluid viscosity and solid\nelasticity. We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely\ndrag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic\nbehavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening,\nwe propose an extension to the elasticity model. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nour model with various simulations that showcase the different aspects of\nporous flow behavior. To summarize, our system of strongly coupled non-pressure\nforces and enforced incompressibility across overlapping phases allows us to\nnaturally model and stably simulate complex porous interactions.","main_category":"cs.GR","categories":"cs.GR,physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-10T13:30:22Z"}

In addition, suitable\ninvariant input and output spaces are derived that allow the GNN models to be\nembedded seamlessly into the LES framework to obtain a symmetry-preserving\nsimulation setup. The suitability of the proposed approach is investigated for\ntwo canonical test cases: Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) and turbulent\nchannel flow. For both cases, GNN models are trained successfully in actual\nsimulations using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure that the models are\nconsistent with the underlying LES formulation and discretization. It is\ndemonstrated for the HIT case that the resulting GNN-based LES scheme recovers\nrotational and reflectional equivariance up to machine precision in actual\nsimulations. At the same time, the stability and accuracy remain on par with\nnon-symmetry-preserving machine learning models that fail to obey these\nproperties. The same modeling strategy translates well to turbulent channel\nflow, where the GNN model successfully learns the more complex flow physics and\nis able to recover the turbulent statistics and Reynolds stresses. It is shown\nthat the GNN model learns a zonal modeling strategy with distinct behaviors in\nthe near-wall and outer regions.

To mitigate such biases, prior studies have\nattempted to project model embeddings into unbiased spaces during inference.\nHowever, these approaches have shown limited effectiveness due to their weak\nalignment with downstream social biases. Inspired by the observation that\nconcept cognition in LLMs is primarily represented through a linear associative\nmemory mechanism, where key-value mapping occurs in the MLP layers, we posited\nthat biased concepts and social groups are similarly encoded as entity (key)\nand information (value) pairs, which can be manipulated to promote fairer\nassociations.

To this end, we\npresent pSEOBNRv5PHM, a parametrized, multipolar, spin-precessing waveform\nmodel for BBHs in quasicircular orbits, built within the effective-one-body\nformalism. Compared to its predecessor, pSEOBNRv4HM, our model introduces\nparametrized deviations from GR not only in the plunge-merger-ringdown stages,\nbut also in the inspiral phase through modifications to the conservative\ndynamics. Additionally, it incorporates, for the first time, spin-precession\neffects. The free deviation parameters can be used to perform null tests of GR\nusing current and future gravitational-wave observations. We validate\npSEOBNRv5PHM through Bayesian parameter estimation, focusing on the\nquasinormal-mode frequency and damping time of the $(\\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$ mode.\nOur analysis of synthetic signals from numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of\nhighly precessing BH mergers shows that, while pSEOBNRv5PHM correctly recovers\nconsistency with GR, neglecting spin precession can lead to false detections of\ndeviations from GR even at current detector sensitivity. Conversely, when\nanalyzing a synthetic signal from a NR simulation of a binary boson-star\nmerger, the model successfully identifies a deviation from a GR BBH signal.\nFinally, we reanalyze 12 events from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient\nCatalog. Using a hierarchical combination of these events, we constrain\nfractional deviations in the frequency and damping time of the $(2,2,0)$\nquasinormal-mode to $\\delta f_{220}=0.00_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ and $\\delta\n\\tau_{220}=0.15_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ at 90% credibility.

However, the number of coefficients in the\ncascaded channels to be estimated in BD-RIS assisted systems is significantly\nlarger than that in conventional RIS assisted systems, because the channels\nassociated with the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix have to be\nestimated as well. Surprisingly, for the first time in the literature, this\npaper rigorously shows that the uplink channel estimation overhead in BD-RIS\nassisted systems is actually of the same order as that in the conventional RIS\nassisted systems. This amazing result stems from a key observation: for each\nuser antenna, its cascaded channel matrix associated with one reference BD-RIS\nelement is a scaled version of that associated with any other BD-RIS element\ndue to the common RIS-base station (BS) channel. In other words, the number of\nindependent unknown variables is far less than it would seem at first glance.\nBuilding upon this property, this paper manages to characterize the minimum\noverhead to perfectly estimate all the channels in the ideal case without noise\nat the BS, and propose a twophase estimation framework for the practical case\nwith noise at the BS. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding channel\nestimation overhead reduction over existing schemes in BD-RIS assisted systems.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT","published":"2025-04-15T06:48:08Z"}

Furthermore,\nexisting DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate\nthe desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead\nto undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we\npropose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the\nobjective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating\nexecution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function\ndirectly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time.\nMaximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is\nminimized without requiring extensive reward engineering. The results show that\nour method consistently learns the optimal policy in all six evaluated business\nprocesses, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithm that can only learn the\noptimal policy in two of the evaluated processes.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-15T14:46:58Z"}

Popular regularization\napproaches include variational regularization and iterative regularization. The\nformer one can be tackled by solving a variational optimization problem, which\nis the sum of a regularization term and a data-fidelity term balanced by a\nproper weight, while the latter one chooses a proper stopping time to avoid\noverfitting to the noise. In the study of regularization, an important topic is\nthe relation between the solution obtained by regularization and the original\nground truth. When the ground truth has low-complexity structure which is\nencoded as the \"model\", a sensitivity property shows that the solution obtained\nfrom proper regularization that promotes the same structure is robust to small\nperturbations, this is called \"model consistency\". For variational\nregularization, model consistency of linear inverse problem is studied in [1].\nWhile, for iterative regularization, the existence of model consistency is an\nopen problem. In this paper, based on a recent development of partial\nsmoothness which is also considered in [1], we show that if the noise level is\nsufficiently small and a proper stopping time is chosen, the solution by\niterative regularization also achieves model consistency and more exhibit local\nlinear convergence behavior.

However, there are indications that cold dark matter may\nencounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly\nat galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models\nincorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale\nproblems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark\nmatter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning\ninto the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly\nincreases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold\ndark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\\rm de}$),\nand dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of\nstate ($w_{\\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark\nenergy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze\ninteracting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these\nscenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their\ncombination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus.

To address this problem, this paper proposes\nFedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.\nTo balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a\nglobal FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized\nbits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources\nreceives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number\nof quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa.

However, simply\nfine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose\nthe learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal\npatterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to\ndisentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional\narchitecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a\nU-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the\ninitial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step\nto prompt the subsequent finer adaptation.

When underwater visibility is insufficient, only sonar\nsystems can provide stable data, which necessitates exploration of the\nunderwater acoustic object tracking (UAOT) task. Previous studies have explored\ntraditional methods and Siamese networks for UAOT. However, the absence of a\nunified evaluation benchmark has significantly constrained the value of these\nmethods. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT\nbenchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and\n205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165\nreveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers. To address these\nlimitations, we propose STFTrack, an efficient framework for acoustic object\ntracking. It includes two novel modules, a multi-view template fusion module\n(MTFM) and an optimal trajectory correction module (OTCM). The MTFM module\nintegrates multi-view feature of both the original image and the binary image\nof the dynamic template, and introduces a cross-attention-like layer to fuse\nthe spatio-temporal target representations. The OTCM module introduces the\nacoustic-response-equivalent pixel property and proposes normalized pixel\nbrightness response scores, thereby suppressing suboptimal matches caused by\ninaccurate Kalman filter prediction boxes. To further improve the model\nfeature, STFTrack introduces a acoustic image enhancement method and a\nFrequency Enhancement Module (FEM) into its tracking pipeline.

HIV self-testing offers a means to overcome barriers\nassociated with routine laboratory-based testing but carries a risk of\nincreasing incidence if replacement effects reduce overall test sensitivity.\nMethods: A linearized four-compartment HIV transmission model was applied to 38\nEnding the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdictions. A threshold testing level\nwas defined to counterbalance potential negative effects from reduced self-test\nsensitivity. Both the percentage of self-tests and the overall testing rate\nwere varied to quantify 10-year changes in HIV incidence. Results: Substantial\nheterogeneity emerged across districts. Incidence reductions exceeded 5 percent\nin some areas, while others saw only minor effects. Jurisdictions with higher\nbaseline testing displayed an elevated risk of increased incidence from\nsubstitution of laboratory-based testing with self-tests.

A key metric for functional safety is achieving a sufficient\nfault coverage. To meet this requirement, extensive time-consuming fault\nsimulation of the RTL code is necessary during the chip design phase.The main\noverhead in RTL fault simulation comes from simulating behavioral nodes (always\nblocks). Due to the limited fault propagation capacity, fault simulation\nresults often match the good simulation results for many behavioral nodes. A\nkey strategy for accelerating RTL fault simulation is the identification and\nelimination of redundant simulations. Existing methods detect redundant\nexecutions by examining whether the fault inputs to each RTL node are\nconsistent with the good inputs. However, we observe that this input comparison\nmechanism overlooks a significant amount of implicit redundant execution:\nalthough the fault inputs differ from the good inputs, the node's execution\nresults remain unchanged. Our experiments reveal that this overlooked redundant\nexecution constitutes nearly half of the total execution overhead of behavioral\nnodes, becoming a significant bottleneck in current RTL fault simulation. The\nunderlying reason for this overlooked redundancy is that, in these cases, the\ntrue execution paths within the behavioral nodes are not affected by the\nchanges in input values. In this work, we propose a behavior-level redundancy\ndetection algorithm that focuses on the true execution paths.

Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel\ntasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up\navenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work\nfocuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental\nlearning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and\nthere is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the\nsensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory\nconstructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the\nrobustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general\nadditive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory\ninto practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct\nnoise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of\nprior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label\nand uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing\nmemory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant\nimprovements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in\nthe noisy CIL setting.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.NE","published":"2025-04-23T14:34:20Z"}

Recent advances in Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and\nvideo understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise\ntemporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video.\nHowever, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption\ngeneration, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some\ntraditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to\ncapture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the\nabove issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for\nSingle-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos.\nTimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass,\nenabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long\nvideo understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a\ntraining-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects\nrepresentative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates\ncomplementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle\nlong temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer\nachieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end\nform, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and\nstrong semantic relevance.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-24T08:27:42Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17742v1","title":"Novel Heusler Materials for Spintronic Applications: Growth,\n  Characterizations and Applications","summary":"Spintronics is a rapidly evolving technology that utilizes the spin of\nelectrons along with their charge to enable high speed, low power and non\nvolatile electronic devices. The development of novel materials with tailored\nmagnetic and electronic properties is critical to exploit the full potential of\nspintronic applications. Among these, Heusler alloys stand out due to their\ntunable multifunctional properties. This review presents a comprehensive\noverview of various Heusler based materials including half metallic\nferromagnets, spin gapless semiconductors, magnetic semiconductors, spin\nsemimetals, and nearly zero moment materials focusing on their synthesis,\nstructural and magnetic characterizations, and transport behavior. The role of\ncrystal structure, and structural disorder in governing their magnetic and\nelectronic properties is discussed in detail. Emphasis is placed on\nexperimental results and their implications for spintronic devices. By bringing\ntogether recent advancements, the review highlights the critical role of\nHeusler alloys in advancing the next-generation spintronic technologies and\noutlines future directions for their integration in practical applications.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-24T16:57:53Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17747v1","title":"Fourier Acceleration in a Linear Sigma Model with Spontaneous Symmetry\n  Breaking","summary":"Fourier acceleration is a technique used in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to\ndecrease the autocorrelation between subsequent field configurations in the\ngenerated ensemble. It has been shown, in the perturbative limit, to eliminate\nthe problem of critical slowing down in a $\\phi^4$ theory (arXiv:1812.05281\n[hep-lat]). As a result, there are several techniques that are being explored\nto generalize Fourier acceleration to work with non-Abelian gauge theories like\nQCD (arXiv:2112.04556 [hep-lat], arXiv:2108.05486 [hep-lat]). It is hoped that\nthese methods will prove effective at overcoming the problem of critical\nslowing down, even in the non-perturbative limit. In our work, we show that\nFourier acceleration can be applied effectively to a linear sigma model in the\nsymmetry broken phase, leading to reduced autocorrelation and faster\nthermalization. We present an algorithm for estimating the optimal Fourier\nacceleration masses dynamically, based on the lattice data. In the future, we\nhope to explore the effectiveness of these techniques in the\nstrongly-interacting case. Since our $\\phi^4$ theory is a linear chiral\neffective theory for QCD, this could be interesting for those who are seeking\nto generalize Fourier acceleration to QCD.","main_category":"hep-lat","categories":"hep-lat","published":"2025-04-24T17:07:44Z"}

We start by recomputing a canonical form for\nthe sunrise integral with all unequal masses. Additionally, we compute for the\nfirst time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal\nmasses and for a four-loop banana integral with two unequal masses. For the\nintegrals we compute, we find an $\\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most\nsimple poles. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs\noperators acting on the integrals considered. In the appendices, we give a\nconstructive explanation for why our generalisation works.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,hep-ph","published":"2025-04-24T17:20:12Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17778v1","title":"Flexoelectric polarization in chiral liquid crystals: electrostatic\n  self-interactions of topological defects","summary":"The presence of topological defects in apolar chiral liquid crystals cause\norientational distortions, leading to non-uniform strain. This non-uniform\nstrain generates an electric polarization response due to the flexoelectric\neffect, which induces an internal electric field. Associated to this electric\nfield is an electrostatic self-energy, which has a back-reaction on the\ndirector field. Calculation of this internal electric field and its resulting\nback-reaction on the director field is complicated. We propose a method to do\nsuch, adapting a method recently developed to study the magnetostatic\nself-interaction effect on skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets. Bloch skyrmions in\nchiral magnets are solenoidal and are unaffected by the magnetostatic\nself-interaction. However, Bloch skyrmions in liquid crystals yield\nnon-solenoidal flexoelectric polarization and, thus, are affected by the\nelectrostatic self-interaction. Additionally, as the flexoelectric coefficients\nare increased in strength, a transition from a hopfion to a skyrmion is\nobserved in three-dimensional confined systems.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-24T17:55:09Z"}

By both symmetry analysis and\nmicroscopic methods we show that there is an additional term - a rotary\ninvariant - in the superconducting free energy which allows for magnetoelectric\neffects even when the previously considered Lifshitz invariant vanishes. We\nshow that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by\nmanipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we\nsuggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry\ntechniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the\nsuperconducting correlations can form a texture.","main_category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":"cond-mat.supr-con","published":"2025-04-24T17:56:00Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17782v1","title":"Unleashing the Power of Natural Audio Featuring Multiple Sound Sources","summary":"Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding\nto distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory\nperception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio\nfor training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio\ncollected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose\ncomplex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby\nallowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two\nremix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and\nuse these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside\nmodel training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition,\nwe propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated\nindependent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\nsound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound\nseparation in natural audio scenarios.
