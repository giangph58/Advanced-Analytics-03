No significant differences in flame response are identified\nin flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations.\nWe find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in\nparticle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any\nintrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust\nflames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to\nthe lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat\nrelease rate. This mechanism is present in conventional, chemistry-driven,\ngaseous flames. However, such a mechanism is absent in iron dust flames because\nthe combustion of individual iron particles is limited by oxygen diffusion,\nwhich is insensitive to temperature.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-03-27T16:22:50Z"}

The in-line holography provides the temporal evolution of the\nvolumetric size distribution of child droplets formed during various\nfragmentation processes at different Weber numbers (We). The droplet undergoes\ndifferent fragmentation processes at significantly lower Weber numbers in\nopposed-flow configurations compared to cross-flow configurations. Our findings\nreveal distinct fragmentation modes, namely bag, bag-stamen, and dual-bag\nbreakup, observed at We=9.38, 16.9, and 18.9, respectively. At We = 9.38, the\ncombined effects of bag rupture, rim breakup, and node fragmentation generate\nchild droplets of varying sizes, driven by the interplay of the\nRayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. At We = 16.9, the\ninteraction of aerodynamic and shear forces leads to bag-stamen fragmentation,\ncharacterized by forming a stamen-like structure along with the bag. Both bag\nand bag-stamen breakups result in tri-modal size distributions. However, at We\n= 16.9, fewer tiny droplets are produced compared to the bag breakup observed\nat lower Weber numbers. In contrast, at We = 18.9, a dual-bag breakup occurs,\nwhere both bags inflate and burst simultaneously. This process generates tiny\nchild droplets in the early stages, while larger child droplets form later due\nto the fragmentation of the rim and nodes, resulting in a bi-modal size\ndistribution. We have performed a theoretical analysis using a two-parameter\ngamma distribution, which satisfactorily predicts the size distributions\nobserved experimentally at different Weber numbers.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-03-31T10:02:22Z"}

In the\nconfined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on\n$S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic\noperator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation\nfunction of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic\nspectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined\ncorrelation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our\nmodel is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective\ninteraction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the\ncoupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation\nfrom the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic\ncorrelation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on\nD7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves\nfrom the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the\nhard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction\nwith spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic\nfermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,hep-ph,nucl-th","published":"2025-03-31T14:51:40Z"}

The challenge of this\ntask lies in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant moments. Previous methods\nfocused on learning continuous features exhibit weak differentiation between\nforeground and background features. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMoment-Quantization based Video Temporal Grounding method (MQVTG), which\nquantizes the input video into various discrete vectors to enhance the\ndiscrimination between relevant and irrelevant moments. Specifically, MQVTG\nmaintains a learnable moment codebook, where each video moment matches a\ncodeword. Considering the visual diversity, i.e., various visual expressions\nfor the same moment, MQVTG treats moment-codeword matching as a clustering\nprocess without using discrete vectors, avoiding the loss of useful information\nfrom direct hard quantization.

As the transportation system becomes denser, different\nmodes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other,\ngiving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this\nstudy, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled\ntransportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a\none-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In\nthis system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with\nnon-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus\nthat partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform\nnumerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are\nto each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number\nof zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between\nthe global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves.\nIn contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We\ndeveloped a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that\ntwo distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability\nanalysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our\nresults show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when\nsharing only partial or no direct route overlaps.

In X-rays, the\nsources show the fast variation features down to millisecond time scales, with\nthe prominent quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around 0.1 Hz - tens of Hz in\nlight curves, however, physical origin of QPOs is still uncertain. FAST as the\nlargest radio telescope provides the opportunity to study fast variability of\nboth radio flux and polarization in microquasars.

However, existing discretization methods\nstill suffer from significant information loss, resulting in a notable\nperformance gap compared to continuous representations. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose two quantization-based discretization methods: Product\nQuantization (PQ) and Random Product Quantization (RPQ). PQ partitions the\noriginal feature space into multiple subspaces and independently quantizes each\nsub-vector, producing a fused set of discrete units that retain diverse\ninformation from different subspaces, thus mitigating the loss associated with\nsingle-cluster quantization. RPQ further enhances representation diversity by\nrandomly sampling a fixed proportion of feature dimensions multiple times to\nconstruct sub-vectors, thereby better capturing the variability in the data\ndistribution. Theoretical analysis shows that RPQ reduces the correlation\ncoefficient rho (where 0 <= rho <= 1) between sub-quantizers. Its quantization\nerror is lower-bounded by the product of rho and epsilon-kms, where epsilon-kms\ndenotes the quantization error of a single K-means quantizer. Experimental\nresults on a combined dataset built from LibriSpeech and ML-SUPERB show that PQ\nand RPQ outperform standard K-means discretization, achieving relative\nimprovements of 21.8 percent and 20.0 percent in WER on LibriSpeech, and 24.1\npercent and 19.6 percent in CER on ML-SUPERB, respectively.

To address these challenges, we introduce\nBRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA\ntasks. BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution\nthat combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.\nFirst, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level\ndata, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function\ndescriptions. This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over\n500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. Second, we propose a\nlightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into\ntext-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data\nwithout architectural modifications. Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x\nimprovements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including\naccuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function\ndescription, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase\nand <30% additional runtime overhead).

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are\nappealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style\ngenerative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on\nmodeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward.\nInspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e.,\nthe query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs'\ngenerative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents\nwith QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield\na better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We\nname our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single\nvector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS)\nand Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to\nprevious tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of\ntokens in the input documents during prediction.

We apply this framework in a real-world case\nstudy on chronic disease monitoring in Italy.\n  Methods. The FARSI framework outlines key principles for developing\nuser-friendly tools that improve the translation of statistical results. We\napplied these principles to create an open-access web application using R\nShiny, designed to communicate chronic disease prevalence estimates from a\nBayesian spatio-temporal logistic model.

As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling\nthese systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level\nObjectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical.\nHowever, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput,\nprimarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO\nattainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1)\nmemory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory\nconstraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default\nFirst-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce\nApt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM\ninference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines\nKV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state\nvectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on\nthe hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism\nthat dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive\nscheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and\nLLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up\nto 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art\ninference serving systems.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T06:51:23Z"}

In the vertically partitioned setting, data is\ndistributed among entities, with each holding only a subset of those features.\nA key challenge in this scenario is that computing distances between records\nrequires access to all distributed features, which may be privacy-sensitive and\ncannot be directly shared with other parties. The goal is to compute the joint\nclusters while preserving the privacy of each entity's dataset. Existing\nsolutions using secret sharing or garbled circuits implement privacy-preserving\nvariants of Lloyd's algorithm but incur high communication costs, scaling as\nO(nkt), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters, and t\nthe number of rounds. These methods become impractical for large datasets or\nseveral parties, limiting their use to LAN settings only. On the other hand, a\ndifferent line of solutions rely on differential privacy (DP) to outsource the\nlocal features of the parties to a central server. However, they often\nsignificantly degrade the utility of the clustering outcome due to excessive\nnoise. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on homomorphic\nencryption and DP, reducing communication complexity to O(n+kt).

Our key insight in\ntackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it\nembeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically\nbroken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the\nsemantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens\nit generates.

The\ngeneralization capabilities of generative retrieval on out-of-distribution\ncorpora have gathered significant attention.\n  In this paper, we examine the inherent limitations of constrained\nauto-regressive generation from two essential perspectives: constraints and\nbeam search. We begin with the Bayes-optimal setting where the generative\nretrieval model exactly captures the underlying relevance distribution of all\npossible documents. Then we apply the model to specific corpora by simply\nadding corpus-specific constraints. Our main findings are two-fold: (i) For the\neffect of constraints, we derive a lower bound of the error, in terms of the KL\ndivergence between the ground-truth and the model-predicted step-wise marginal\ndistributions. (ii) For the beam search algorithm used during generation, we\nreveal that the usage of marginal distributions may not be an ideal approach.\nThis paper aims to improve our theoretical understanding of the generalization\ncapabilities of the auto-regressive decoding retrieval paradigm, laying a\nfoundation for its limitations and inspiring future advancements toward more\nrobust and generalizable generative retrieval.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-14T06:54:49Z"}

Despite\nthis, conventional DCS suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single\nacquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by\nthe high peak power of mode-locked pulses, necessitating coherent averaging.\nConsequently, averaging numerous interferograms compromises both the\nexceptional time resolution and places greater demands on long-term mutual\ncoherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to\nenhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in\ncoherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs\nwith mode spacing of $\\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition\nrate of $\\sim$250 MHz. The result demonstrates a $>$300-fold reduction in\naveraging time while achieving comparable SNR in conventional DCS. This\nreduction is expected to be further enhancement through integration with\nultra-high repetition rate combs, such as microresonator combs.

To implement this, the teacher model first\nlearns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion\nmorphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation\nmethod that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales. Our approach leverages\nan anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to\nseparate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field\ndepth and tapered far-field depth. The anchor acts as a normalization factor,\nenabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while\nmapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero. Through this approach, any depth\nfrom zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified\nrepresentation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene\nscale variations. More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide\nalong the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales. A\nsmaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth\nprecision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in\nfar regions. This adaptability enables the model to handle depth predictions at\nvarying distances and ensure strong generalization across datasets. Our design\nenables a unified and adaptive depth representation across diverse\nenvironments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Metric-Solver outperforms\nexisting methods in both accuracy and cross-dataset generalization.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-16T14:12:25Z"}

However, the security problems of smart contracts become\nincreasingly prominent. Security events caused by smart contracts occur\nfrequently, and the existence of malicious codes may lead to the loss of user\nassets and system crash. In this paper, a simple study is carried out on\nmalicious code detection of intelligent contracts based on machine learning.\nThe main research work and achievements are as follows: Feature extraction and\nvectorization of smart contract are the first step to detect malicious code of\nsmart contract by using machine learning method, and feature processing has an\nimportant impact on detection results. In this paper, an opcode vectorization\nmethod based on smart contract text is adopted.

However, such a\nretrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful\nrecall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended\ncontexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,\nshort-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for\nmultilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes\nbeyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop\ninference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,\nMLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to\narbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large\nlanguage model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource\nlanguages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple\nfacts or predict the absence of information.

The conducted research identified three main types of\nquadratic (square root) voting. Two of them pertain to voting with a split\nstake, and one involves voting without splitting. In split stakes, Type 1 QV\napplies the square root to the total stake before distributing it among\npreferences, while Type 2 QV distributes the stake first and then applies the\nsquare root. In unsplit stakes (Type 3 QV), the square root of the total stake\nis allocated entirely to each preference. The presented formal proofs confirm\nthat Types 2 and 3 QV, along with generalized models, enhance decentralization\nas measured by the Gini and Nakamoto coefficients. A pivotal discovery is the\nexistence of a threshold stakeholder whose relative voting ratio increases\nunder QV compared to linear voting, while smaller stakeholders also gain\ninfluence. The generalized QV model allows flexible adjustment of this\nthreshold, enabling tailored decentralization levels. Maintaining fairness, QV\nensures that stakeholders with higher stakes retain a proportionally greater\nvoting ratio while redistributing influence to prevent excessive concentration.\nIt is shown that to preserve fairness and robustness, QV must be implemented\nalongside privacy-preserving cryptographic voting protocols, as voters casting\ntheir ballots last could otherwise manipulate outcomes.

Interestingly, despite their significant\ndifference in magnitudes, the Weissenberg number ($Wi$) for the onset of flow\ninstability obtained from the shear and extensile components remains almost the\nsame. We also find that the turbulent motion of the probe at higher $Wi$\nresults from the complex mixing of the stick-slip events originating from the\npartial release of the stored elastic energy. Further, we show that the\nmagnitude of the stick-slip events depends on the detailed micellar structure\nand dynamics controlled by salt concentration and temperature.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-17T16:46:19Z"}

For example,\nText-to-SQL requires SQL queries and correspond natural language questions as\ntraining samples. However, collecting such query corpus remains challenging in\npractice due to the high cost of manual annotation, which highlights the\nimportance of automatic SQL generation. Despite recent advances, existing\ngeneration methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and\ncost-effectiveness.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nmulti-agent framework for high-quality and large-scale SQL generation, dubbed\nSQL-Factory.

This modular\nframework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and\ngeneration cost. We apply SQL-Factory to four widely used benchmarks and\ngenerate over 300,000 executable and broadly distributed SQL queries with less\nthan $200 API cost.

Verifying\nthis hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from\nyoung stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the\ngreatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies.\nIn this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that\nstate-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories\n(SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs;\n$\\sim0.1$ dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations\non tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems\n($\\sim0.15$ dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to\npriors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise\n($\\rm20~pixel^{-1}$) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame\n$0.12-1.06~\\mu$m).

This study investigates the feasibility of\nleveraging language models for automated patient record linkage, focusing on\ntwo key tasks: blocking and matching. Materials and Methods: We utilized\nreal-world healthcare data from the Missouri Cancer Registry and Research\nCenter, linking patient records from two independent sources using\nprobabilistic linkage as a baseline. A transformer-based model, RoBERTa, was\nfine-tuned for blocking using sentence embeddings. For matching, several\nlanguage models were experimented under fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\nassessing their performance against ground truth labels. Results: The\nfine-tuned blocking model achieved a 92% reduction in the number of candidate\npairs while maintaining near-perfect recall. In the matching task, fine-tuned\nMistral-7B achieved the best performance with only 6 incorrect predictions.\nAmong zero-shot models, Mistral-Small-24B performed best, with a total of 55\nincorrect predictions. Discussion: Fine-tuned language models achieved strong\nperformance in patient record blocking and matching with minimal errors.\nHowever, they remain less accurate and efficient than a hybrid rule-based and\nprobabilistic approach for blocking. Additionally, reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 are impractical for large-scale record linkage due to high\ncomputational costs.

The property of decentralization enables adversaries to\ncraft carefully designed backdoor updates to make the global model misclassify\nonly when encountering adversary-chosen triggers. Existing defense mechanisms\nmainly rely on post-training detection after receiving updates. These methods\neither fail to identify updates which are deliberately fabricated statistically\nclose to benign ones, or show inconsistent performance in different FL training\nstages.

However, the accuracy of tail-fitted SSS is limited,\nfor example, by mismatches between the attenuation image and the PET emission\ndata or by the presence of activity outside the FOV. These shortcomings can be\naddressed using energy-based scatter estimation (EBSE), as recently proposed by\nEfthimiou et al. and Hamill et al. The aim of this work is to 1. improve the\naccuracy of EBSE by accounting for the LOR dependence of the energy spectrum of\nunscattered photons, 2. improve the computational speed of EBSE through better\ninitialization and a more efficient optimization algorithm. The proposed\nimproved EBSE method models the energy probability density function (PDF) of\nboth single and multiple scattered photons, and incorporates a\nposition-dependent energy PDF for unscattered photons. These energy PDFs form\nthe basis of two forward models used for scatter estimation based on 2D energy\nhistograms.

Despite decades of\nresearch, many open questions remain regarding structure-property\nrelationships, particularly in heterogeneous networks. While existing polymer\nnetwork models connect chain properties to emergent network behavior, they are\noften limited to monodisperse networks with regular connectivities, making the\nextension to heterogeneous systems an active area of research. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel modeling framework that shifts the focus from individual\npolymer chains to cross-links and their connected chains as the fundamental\nunit of analysis. This perspective enables direct incorporation of structural\nheterogeneity by averaging over cross-links with different chain lengths and\ncoordination numbers. We establish important connections between polymerization\ntheory and statistical descriptors of network structure, providing key\ncomponents of a theoretical foundation for predicting properties from the\nsynthesis parameters. Our results demonstrate that increased variance in\nmonomer numbers generally leads to network softening, while in bimodal\nnetworks, the onset of strain stiffening is controlled by shorter chains and\nthe stiffening response is modulated by the ratio of short to long chains.

Classical numerical schemes in\ngeneral fail to resolve the oscillatory behaviour in the solution which leads\nto numerical instabilities and loss of convergence. Dispersive equations, e.g.,\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger, Korteweg--de Vries and wave equations, thereby pose in\nparticular a big problem as in contrast to the parabolic setting, no strong\nsmoothing can be expected, i.e., if the initial data is rough, the solution\nstays rough which makes their approximation a delicate task. In this review we\ngive an overview on a new numerical ansatz which aims to tackle the time\ndynamics of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations even for very\nrough data. This is achieved by a resonance analysis and decorated tree\nformalism that draws its inpiration from the combinatorics used in the theory\nof regularity structures for solving singular SPDEs. One can hope to see this\nformalism applied in other contexts for dispersive PDEs and beyond.","main_category":"math.NA","categories":"math.NA,cs.NA,math.AP,math.RA","published":"2025-04-28T10:04:48Z"}

To elucidate\nthis phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving\nmemory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal\ncorrelations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory\ncapacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons\nsuccessively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial\norders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal\ncorrelations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of\nnonlinear computational capabilities.

To improve performance, several extensions to the\nstandard QAOA framework have been proposed in recent years. Two notable\ndirections include: warm-starting techniques, which incorporate classical\napproximate solutions to guide the quantum evolution, and custom mixer\nHamiltonians, such as XY mixers, which constrain the search to feasible\nsubspaces aligned with the structure of the problem. In this work, we propose\nan approach that integrates these two strategies: a warm-start initialization\nwith an XY mixer ansatz, enabling constraint-preserving quantum evolution\nbiased toward high-quality classical solutions. The method begins by\nreformulating the combinatorial problem as a MaxCut instance, solved\napproximately using the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. The resulting binary\nsolution is relaxed and used to construct a biased superposition over valid\none-hot quantum states, maintaining compatibility with the XY mixer's\nconstraints. We evaluate the approach on 5-city instances of the Traveling\nSalesperson Problem, a canonical optimization problem frequently encountered as\na subroutine in real-world Vehicle Routing Problems. Our method is benchmarked\nagainst both the standard XY-mixer QAOA and a warm-start-only variant based on\nMaxCut relaxation. Results show that the proposed combination consistently\noutperforms both baselines in terms of the percentage and rank of optimal\nsolutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining structured\ninitializations with constraint-aware quantum evolution for optimization\nproblems.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-28T16:08:38Z"}

Simultaneous control and trajectory\nestimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified\nsolution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on\nappropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear\ntime-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization\nmethods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory\nEstimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes\nfeasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then,\nit simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy\nobservations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize\ndeviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions.\nThe proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be\napplied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state\nupdate equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states\nin the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features\nprovide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In\naddition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs\nincremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces\na time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be\ndynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of\nthe planned trajectory.

This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting\nfrom expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed\na preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different\nreward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that\nincorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward\nuncertainty.

We also design a\ndynamic stream aggregation strategy at the receiver, which provides the\ncomposite framework with more robustness to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nfluctuations in wireless systems compared to a single conventional codec.\nFinally, the proposed framework is verified to surpass the performance of both\ntraditional and DL-based competitors in a large range of scenarios and\nmeanwhile, maintains lightweight in terms of the transmission and computational\ncomplexity of semantic stream, which exhibits the potential to be applied in\nreal systems.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,math.IT","published":"2025-04-30T09:41:16Z"}

This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects\nexpert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of\ncandidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the\nsegmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting\ntheir contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category.\nInspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture\ntreats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector\nfields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union)\nfrom the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy\nto fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This\nfusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different\ncategories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the\narchitecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise\npotentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two\nremote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced\nsemantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF\narchitecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA\ndataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on\nthe validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the\nmIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set.\nThese results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the\nClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.\nThe full code is available at https://github.com/zhuqinfeng1999/ClassWise-CRF.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.MM","published":"2025-04-30T10:19:21Z"}

To address these issues, we propose an\nefficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object\nMulti-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT). The proposed framework utilizes Mask R-CNN for\nobject detection and employs Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select target\nobjects from overlapping detections. Transfer learning is employed for\nre-identification, enabling the association and generation of vehicle tracklets\nacross multiple cameras. Moreover, we leverage appropriate loss functions and\ndistance measures to handle occlusion, illumination, and shadow challenges. The\nfinal solution identification module performs feature extraction using\nResNet-152 coupled with Deep SORT based vehicle tracking. The proposed\nframework is evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset (Track 3),\ncomprising 46 camera feeds. Among these 46 camera streams, 40 are used for\nmodel training and validation, while the remaining six are utilized for model\ntesting. The proposed framework achieves competitive performance with an IDF1\nscore of 0.8289, and precision and recall scores of 0.9026 and 0.8527\nrespectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in robust and accurate vehicle\ntracking.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-01T14:00:25Z"}

In essence, ST-GRB extends the classical reduced\nbasis (RB) method, exploiting a data-driven low-dimensional linear encoding of\nthe temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current\ninvestigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on\nthe topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes\nequations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a\nhyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine\ndecompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we\nmove beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures,\nacknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of\ncomplex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the\nCoupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the\nfluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In\nparticular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal\nprojection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a\nby-product. The performances of ST-GRB are assessed in three different\nnumerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can\noutperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of\nhigh-fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational\ngains of ST-GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large,\nwhich occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions\nare sought.","main_category":"math.NA","categories":"math.NA,cs.NA","published":"2025-05-01T14:24:41Z"}

Objects that are heavily occluded or\nintentionally concealed pose a great challenge for detection, whether by human\nobservation or through advanced technological applications. While certain Deep\nLearning (DL) architectures demonstrate strong performance in processing local\ninformation, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others excel in\nhandling distant information, e.g., transformers. In X-ray security imaging the\nliterature has been dominated by the use of CNN-based methods, while the\nintegration of the two aforementioned leading architectures has not been\nsufficiently explored. In this paper, various hybrid CNN-transformer\narchitectures are evaluated against a common CNN object detection baseline,\nnamely YOLOv8. In particular, a CNN (HGNetV2) and a hybrid CNN-transformer\n(Next-ViT-S) backbone are combined with different CNN/transformer detection\nheads (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR). The resulting architectures are comparatively\nevaluated on three challenging public X-ray inspection datasets, namely EDS,\nHiXray, and PIDray. Interestingly, while the YOLOv8 detector with its default\nbackbone (CSP-DarkNet53) is generally shown to be advantageous on the HiXray\nand PIDray datasets, when a domain distribution shift is incorporated in the\nX-ray images (as happens in the EDS datasets), hybrid CNN-transformer\narchitectures exhibit increased robustness. Detailed comparative evaluation\nresults, including object-level detection performance and object-size error\nanalysis, demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each architectural\ncombination and suggest guidelines for future research.

The latter is strongly\naffected by surface active agents that are present in many applications.\nSurfactants lead to local changes in the interfacial tension, which influence\nthe mass transfer rates in two different ways. On the one hand, inhomogeneous\ninterfacial tension leads to Marangoni stress, which can strongly change the\nlocal hydrodynamics. One the other hand, the coverage by surfactant molecules\nresults in a mass transfer resistance. This hindrance effect is not included in\ncurrent continuum physical models. The present work provides the experimental\nvalidation of a recently introduced extended sharp-interface model for\ntwo-phase flows with mass transfer that also accounts for the mass transfer\nhindrance due to adsorbed surfactant. The crucial feature is to account for\narea-specific concentrations not only of adsorbed constituents but also of\ntransfer species, and to model mass transfer as a series of two bi-directional\nsorption-type bulk-interface exchange processes. The resulting model is shown\nto quantitatively describe experimental measurements on mass transfer reduction\nfor the dissolution of CO$_2$ bubbles in different surfactant solutions.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-05-01T15:12:04Z"}
