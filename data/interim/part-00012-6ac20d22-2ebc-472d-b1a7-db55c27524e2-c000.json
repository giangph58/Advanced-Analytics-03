This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are\npromising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward\ngeneral-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-03-27T16:35:02Z"}

We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining\nmaterial and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar\nperformance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts\nsuch as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained\non the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited\nto a single register, combining well-performing registers like\nHow-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major\nimprovements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key\ndifferences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as\npretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer\nof model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection\npractices.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-04-02T09:30:24Z"}

Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders\nto fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus\ntowards designing low-complexity iterative decoders.

The main objective of this paper\nis to analyze the decoding failures of the \\emph{hypergraph-product} and\n\\emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these\nfailures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of\nthese codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1)\nstabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers,\nand (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes\nutilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes.\nThe dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a\nstraightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent\nthese trapping sets.

Then, the bar rotates at less than $\\Omega_p \\sim\n3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before\ninteraction) pattern speed of $\\Omega_p \\sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the\nK21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct\nevidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal\ninteraction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a\nnon-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed\nslow-rotating bars.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-02T16:24:01Z"}

However, creating compelling crowd scenes demands more than just\nfunctional movement-it requires capturing high-level interactions between\nagents, their environment, and each other over time. To address this issue, we\nintroduce Gen-C, a generative model to automate the task of authoring\nhigh-level crowd behaviors. Gen-C bypasses the labor-intensive and challenging\ntask of collecting and annotating real crowd video data by leveraging a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate a limited set of crowd scenarios, which are\nsubsequently expanded and generalized through simulations to construct\ntime-expanded graphs that model the actions and interactions of virtual agents.\nOur method employs two Variational Graph Auto-Encoders guided by a condition\nprior network: one dedicated to learning a latent space for graph structures\n(agent interactions) and the other for node features (agent actions and\nnavigation). This setup enables the flexible generation of dynamic crowd\ninteractions. The trained model can be conditioned on natural language,\nempowering users to synthesize novel crowd behaviors from text descriptions. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two scenarios, a University\nCampus and a Train Station, showcasing its potential for populating diverse\nvirtual environments with agents exhibiting varied and dynamic behaviors that\nreflect complex interactions and high-level decision-making patterns.","main_category":"cs.GR","categories":"cs.GR,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-02T17:33:53Z"}

Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling\noffer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON\nlacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative\nAgent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate\nevaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is\ndesigned and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from\nreward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics\non Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms\nbaselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and\nwithout LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics.

However, optimizing directly such a\nrate-distortion trade-off requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding,\nand feature evaluation for each coding parameter, which is computationally\nimpractical. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make\nthe distortion term computable using block-based encoders.

Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice\ncritical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce\ndifferential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves\ntask-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this\nprinciple, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that\nprocesses hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms:\n(1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while\nmaintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential\nfeature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the\npatch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing\nnon-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance\nacross four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content.\nNotably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single\nNVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while\nmaintaining state-of-the-art performance.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-03T09:55:09Z"}

However, fully decentralized solutions are usually\nmuch harder to design, and tend to have a much higher overhead compared to\ncentralized approaches, where the peers are connected to a powerful server. On\nthe other hand, centralized approaches have a single point of failure. Thus, is\nthere some way to combine their advantages without inheriting their\ndisadvantages? To that end, we consider a supervised peer-to-peer approach\nwhere the peers can ask a potentially unreliable supervisor for advice. This is\nin line with the increasingly popular algorithmic paradigm called algorithms\nwith predictions or learning-augmented algorithms, but we are the first to\nconsider it in the context of peer-to-peer networks.\n  Specifically, we design self-stabilizing algorithms for the fundamental\nproblem of distributed graph linearization, where peers are supposed to recover\nthe \"sorted line\" network from any initial network after a transient fault.\nWith the help of the supervisor, peers can recover the sorted line network in\n$O(\\log n)$ time, if the advice is correct; otherwise, the algorithm retains\nits original recovery time (i.e., without any supervisor). A crucial challenge\nthat we overcome is to correctly compose multiple self-stabilizing algorithms,\nthat is, one that processes and exploits the advice, and another that does not\nrely on the advice at all. Our key technical contributions combine ideas from\nthe fields of overlay networks and proof-labeling schemes.

To address this\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\nglobal path planning model for the robot.

In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter.

Traditional\nfederated edge computing (EC) methods require frequent central communication,\nconsuming substantial energy and struggling with resource heterogeneity across\ndevices, networks, and data. To this end, this paper introduces a decentralized\nsemantic federated learning (DSFL) framework tailored for large-scale wireless\ncommunication systems and heterogeneous MEDs. The framework incorporates a\nhierarchical semantic communication (SC) scheme to extend EC coverage and\nreduce communication overhead. Specifically, the lower layer optimizes intra-BS\ncommunication through task-specific encoding and selective transmission under\nconstrained networks, while the upper layer ensures robust inter-BS\ncommunication via semantic aggregation and distributed consensus across\ndifferent regions. To further balance communication costs and semantic\naccuracy, an energy-efficient aggregation scheme is developed for both intra-BS\nand inter-BS communication. The effectiveness of the DSFL framework is\ndemonstrated through a case study using the BoWFire dataset, showcasing its\npotential in real-time fire detection scenarios.

However, limited attention has been given to the\ninterpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In\naddition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their\nown homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered,\nand an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering\n(IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is\nfully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples\nare grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors\nof all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the\nclusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making\nprocess of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices\nare introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by\ncapturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different\nstyles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data\nrepresentation capability.

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle\nmultiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential.\nHowever, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather\nconditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world\ndegradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with\ndegradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed\nDA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive\ndegradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration.\nSpecifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware\nrepresentations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space.\nBy aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each\nprompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The\nlearned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed\nweather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple\nweather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather\ndegradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a\ndynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of\nrestoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion\nmodel to restore diverse degradations adaptively.

The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high\nmomentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and\nspin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a\nlinear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits\nspin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and\nnext-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other\nruthenate trimers in this series.

Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch\nof Welfare Economics, contains several impossibility results that place limits\non the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social\ndecision-making processes. A formal relationship between G\\\"odel's\nIncompleteness Theorems in formal logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in\nSocial Choice Theory has long been conjectured. In this paper, we address this\ngap by bringing these two theories closer by introducing a general mathematical\nobject called a Self-Reference System. Impossibility in Social Choice Theory is\ndemonstrated to correspond to the impossibility of a Self-Reference System to\ninterpret its own internal consistency. We also provide a proof of G\\\"odel's\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem in the same terms. Together, this recasts Arrow's\nImpossibility Theorem as incomputability in the G\\\"odelian sense. The\nincomputability results in both fields are shown to arise out of\nself-referential paradoxes.

It regulates concurrent access to database data by following a\nspecific sequence of acquiring and releasing locks during transaction\nexecution, thereby ensuring transaction isolation. However, in strict 2PL,\ntransactions must wait for conflicting transactions to commit and release their\nlocks, which reduces concurrency and system throughput. We have observed this\nissue is exacerbated in high-contented workloads at Tencent, where lock\ncontention can severely degrade system performance. While existing\noptimizations demonstrate some effectiveness in high-contention scenarios,\ntheir performance remains insufficient, as they suffer from lock contention and\nwaiting in hotspot access.\n  This paper presents optimizations in lock management implemented in Tencent's\ndatabase, TXSQL, with a particular focus on high-contention scenarios. First,\nwe discuss our motivations and the journey toward general lock optimization,\nwhich includes lightweight lock management, a copy-free active transaction\nlist, and queue locking mechanisms that effectively enhance concurrency.\nSecond, we introduce a hotspot-aware approach that enables certain highly\nconflicting transactions to switch to a group locking method, which groups\nconflicting transactions at a specific hotspot, allowing them to execute\nserially in an uncommitted state within a conflict group without the need for\nlocking, thereby reducing lock contention.

Abbasi et al. presented a unified\napproach to obtain EPASes (i.e., $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximations running in time\nFPT in $k$ and $\\epsilon$) for $k$-Clustering in metrics of bounded scatter\ndimension. However, a seemingly inherent limitation of their approach was that\nit could only handle clustering objectives where each point was assigned to the\nclosest chosen center. They explicitly asked, if there exist EPASes for\nconstrained $k$-Clustering in metrics of bounded scatter dimension.\n  We present a unified framework which yields EPASes capacitated and fair\n$k$-Median/Means in metrics of bounded algorithmic scatter dimension.

However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited.\nHere, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the\ncloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted\nclouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to\nautomatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud\nadjustments to aerosols.

By contrast,\nliquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally\ndecrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most\nof these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from\ndifferences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud\nfraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1\nto -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal\nvariations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may\npartially offset it.

This\nrequires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human\nbehaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are\nperceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots\nshould strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if\nhumans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed \"long\nshort-term intention prediction\". This task requires robots can predict the\nlong-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short\nterm intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention.\nMeanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the\nshort-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and\nsuggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention\nmodel to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train\nthis intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the\nintention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based\nlong-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing\nthe consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist\nrobots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and\nshort-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term\nand short-term intentions of humans.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-10T09:50:18Z"}

We demand fairness and efficiency for both\nsides separately, giving rise to the following criteria: (i) every course gets\nthe required number of TAs and the average utility of the assigned TAs meets a\nthreshold; (ii) the allocation of courses to TAs is envy-free, where a TA\nenvies another TA if the former prefers the latter's course and has a higher or\nequal grade in that course.

The Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) method\nhas emerged as a robust and efficient numerical framework that intrinsically\npreserves geometric properties, accommodates material nonlinearity, and\naccurately models interactions with external environments and fields. By\ndirectly discretizing geometric and mechanical quantities, DDG provides an\naccurate, stable, and efficient approach to modeling flexible structures,\naddressing key limitations of traditional numerical methods. This tutorial\nprovides a systematic introduction to the DDG method for simulating nonlinear\nbehaviors in flexible structures. It covers DDG theory, simulation frameworks,\nand MATLAB implementation, with examples spanning dynamic systems, geometric\nand material nonlinearities, and external interactions like magnetics and\nfluids, culminating in practical insights and future directions. By offering a\ncomprehensive and practical guide, together with open-source MATLAB code, this\ntutorial aims to facilitate the broader adoption of DDG-based numerical tools\namong researchers and engineers in computational mechanics, applied\nmathematics, and structural design.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-15T17:33:06Z"}

In active matter physics, most models\nfocus on thermal fluctuations due to a surrounding solvent. An alternative but\nmuch less explored noise source can occur due to fluctuating external fields,\nwhich typically feature certain spatial correlations. In this work, we\nintroduce a minimal model to explore the influence of spatially correlated but\ntemporally uncorrelated noise on the collective behavior of active particles.\nWe find that specifically in chiral active particles such fluctuations induce\nthe formation of network patterns, which neither occur for spatially\n(uncorrelated) thermal noise, nor in the complete absence of fluctuations.\nThese networks show (i) a percolated structure, (ii) local alignment of the\ncontained particles, but no global alignment, and (iii) hardly coarsen. We\nperform a topological data analysis to systematically characterize the topology\nof the network patterns.

The constitutive model is a transversely isotropic extension of\nan isotropic finite strain viscoplasticity model for neat polymers.\nRate-dependent plasticity and creep are described by a non-Newtonian flow rule\nwhere the viscosity of the material depends on an equivalent stress measure\nthrough an Eyring-type relation. In the present formulation, transverse\nisotropy is incorporated by defining the equivalent stress measure and flow\nrule as functions of transversely isotropic stress invariants. In addition, the\nEyring-type viscosity function is extended with anisotropic pressure\ndependence. As a result of the formulation, plastic flow in fiber direction is\neffectively excluded and pressure dependence of the polymer matrix is accounted\nfor. The re-orientation of the transversely isotropic plane during plastic\ndeformations is incorporated in the constitutive equations, allowing for an\naccurate large deformation response. The formulation is fully implicit and a\nconsistent linearization of the algorithmic constitutive equations is performed\nto derive the consistent tangent modulus. The performance of the mesoscopic\nconstitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical\nmodel for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the\npolymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to\ndetermine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few\nstress-strain curves.

However, practical implementations often\nrequire better error-correction performance than what SC decoding provides,\nparticularly at short to moderate code lengths. Successive-cancellation flip\n(SCF) decoding algorithm was proposed to improve error-correction performance\nwith an aim to detect and correct the first wrongly estimated bit in a codeword\nbefore resuming SC decoding. At each additional SC decoding trial, i.e.,\ndecoding attempt beyond the initial unsuccessful trial, one bit estimated as\nthe least reliable is flipped. Dynamic SCF (DSCF) is a variation of SCF, where\nmultiple bits may be flipped simultaneously per trial. Despite the improved\nerror-correction performance compared to the SC decoder, SCF-based decoders\nhave variable execution time, which leads to high average execution time and\nlatency. In this work, we propose the generalized restart mechanism (GRM) that\nallows to skip decoding computations that are identical between the initial\ntrial and any additional trial. Under DSCF decoding with up to 3-bit flips per\ndecoding trial, our proposed GRM is shown to reduce the average execution time\nby 25% to 60% without any negative effect on error-correction performance. The\nproposed mechanism is adaptable to state-of-the-art latency-reduction\ntechniques. When applied to Fast-DSCF-3 decoding, the additional reduction\nbrought by the GRM is 15% to 22%.

However, recent methods often\noverlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying\ngeometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this\npaper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with\nfeatures from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and\nboost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning\nDGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen\nDINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of\nthe VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple\ndomain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth\nawareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement\ndecoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine\nmulti-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different\ndatsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches\nwith stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior\ngeneralization ability.

The\nconvergence is established through a technically constructed Lyapunov function,\nwhich guarantees sufficient descent and has a well-defined lower bound.\n  With properly chosen parameters, PPG-ADMM converges to an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point at a sublinear convergence rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$.\n  Furthermore, by appropriately tuning the perturbation parameter $\\beta$, it\nachieves an $\\epsilon$-stationary point, providing stronger optimality\nguarantees.

While\nconcept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based\napproaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting\nsampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods\nrely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is\nbuilt on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free\nguidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content\nmodification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This\ninspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the\nearly-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image\nmanifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection.

As such, amateur\nusers can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's\nwork and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright\ninfringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually\nimperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles\n(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in\nthe artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model\nhas been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model\nretraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.\n  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the\ntext-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to\nidentify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of\nspecific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,\nArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style\nrepresentations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,\nArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.\nThe experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that\nArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying\nArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights\ninto the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario.

As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails\nto capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective\nfractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and\nan emergent U(1) gauge field.

The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking\nmethods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution\ndiscontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers,\nfunctioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of\n$r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual\nwith respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the\ngrid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are\nproposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render\nstabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and\nmodifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is\nused to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1)\nlessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers,\n(2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with\nthe given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a\nmajority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A\nseries of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves\nviscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux\nprofiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in\nterms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$-adaptation with a high-order\ndiscretization.","main_category":"math.NA","categories":"math.NA,cs.NA,math.OC,physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-21T15:39:42Z"}

Since\nworkers are typically unwilling to provide training services/models freely and\nvoluntarily, many incentive mechanisms in FL are designed to incentivize\nparticipation by offering monetary rewards from requesters. However, existing\nstudies neglect two crucial aspects of real-world FL scenarios. First, workers\ncan possess inherent incompatibility characteristics (e.g., communication\nchannels and data sources), which can lead to degradation of FL efficiency\n(e.g., low communication efficiency and poor model generalization). Second, the\nrequesters are budgeted, which limits the amount of workers they can hire for\ntheir tasks. In this paper, we investigate the scenario in FL where multiple\nbudgeted requesters seek training services from incompatible workers with\nprivate training costs. We consider two settings: the cooperative budget\nsetting where requesters cooperate to pool their budgets to improve their\noverall utility and the non-cooperative budget setting where each requester\noptimizes their utility within their own budgets. To address efficiency\ndegradation caused by worker incompatibility, we develop novel\ncompatibility-aware incentive mechanisms, CARE-CO and CARE-NO, for both\nsettings to elicit true private costs and determine workers to hire for\nrequesters and their rewards while satisfying requester budget constraints. Our\nmechanisms guarantee individual rationality, truthfulness, budget feasibility,\nand approximation performance.

The structural\nproperties are examined through their substitution rules. To study the\nelectronic properties, we construct a tight-binding model on the tilings,\nintroducing two types of hopping integrals, $t_L$ and $t_S$, corresponding to\nthe two edge lengths, $\\ell$ and $s$, respectively. By diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian on these quasiperiodic tilings, we compute the corresponding\ndensity of states (DOS). Our analysis reveals that the introduction of\nquasiperiodicity in the distribution of hopping integrals induces a spiky\nstructure in the DOS at higher energies, while the linear DOS at low energies\n($E\\sim 0$) remains robust. This contrasts with the smooth DOS in the\ndisordered tight-binding model, where two types of hopping integrals are\nrandomly distributed according to a given ratio. Furthermore, we study the\nmagnetic properties of the Hubbard model on modulated honeycomb lattices by\nmeans of real-space Hartree approximations.

Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance\nas they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to\nimplement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the\nstrength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called\nthe Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we\nconvert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise\ncomparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information\nformulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse.

The model is\npre-trained via a band-wise masked autoencoder and subsequently fine-tuned on\nspatio-temporally aligned multispectral-hyperspectral image pairs. The\nresulting synthetic hyperspectral data retain the spatial and temporal benefits\nof multispectral imagery and improve GHG prediction accuracy relative to using\nmultispectral data alone. This approach effectively bridges the trade-off\nbetween spectral resolution and coverage, highlighting its potential to advance\natmospheric monitoring by combining the strengths of hyperspectral and\nmultispectral systems with self-supervised deep learning.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-23T16:19:42Z"}

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input\ndistribution, it does not misattribute. We further conjecture that\nmisattribution arises in any reasonable additive decomposition that depends on\nthe distribution of the covariates.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME,cs.LG,econ.EM,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-23T16:36:55Z"}

Accurate\ndetection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect\nsoftware systems from malicious attacks. Recently, vulnerability detection\nmethods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered\nincreasing attention. However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing\nindividual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient\ncontextual information. Analyzing entire repositories to gather context\nintroduces significant noise and computational overhead. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that\ncombines program analysis with LLMs. Specifically, we use program analysis to\nextract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby\nfiltering out irrelevant noise. The abstracted context along with source code\nare provided to LLM for vulnerability detection. We investigate how different\nlevels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection\nperformance. Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient\ndetail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary\ncomplexity that could hinder model performance. Based on an extensive study\nusing GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key\nfindings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances\nvulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from\ndistinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding\ncapabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for\ngeneral LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further\nattention.","main_category":"cs.SE","categories":"cs.SE","published":"2025-04-23T16:54:16Z"}

Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations,\nleading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally,\nindustrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance,\nwith defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data\nrespectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that\ndynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class\nimbalance.

In this study, the\nevolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H\nand He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular\ndynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient\nand suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing\ninteratomic interactions is established.

However, achieving\nsufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) EO combs for use across the broad\nrange of wavelengths required in the aforementioned applications is hindered by\nthe corresponding unavailability of relevant components such as\nnarrow-linewidth lasers, electro-optic phase modulators with adequate optical\npower handling, and low-noise optical amplifiers. Here, we address the latter\ntwo points by showing that optical injection locking of commercial Fabry-Perot\n(FP) laser diodes can help enable high SNR EO combs. We injection lock the FP\nlaser diode to more than 10^6 comb teeth at injected comb powers as low as 1 nW\nand produce a high SNR replica of the EO comb. In comparison to a commercial\nsemiconductor optical amplifier, injection locking achieves approximately 100x\ngreater SNR for the same input power (when <1 microwatt) and equal SNR for >\n35x lower input power. Such low-power injection locking is of particular\nrelevance in conjunction with nanophotonic spectral translation, which extends\nthe range of wavelengths available for EO combs. We show that the usable\nwavelength range of an EO comb produced by photo-induced second harmonic\ngeneration of an EO comb in a silicon nitride resonator is significantly\nincreased when combined with optical injection locking. Our results demonstrate\nthat optical injection locking provides a versatile and high-performance\napproach to addressing many different scenarios in which EO comb SNR would be\notherwise limited.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-04-30T15:40:49Z"}

Recent\nworks have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several\nquantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open\nsystems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics.\nHowever, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath\nstate, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations.

It is shown\nthat the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early\nrelaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded\nthermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a\ntwo-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial\natom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba\neffect.

In particular, the kilonova signal following a merger can help\nus elucidate the role of neutron stars in nucleosynthesis, and informs us about\nthe properties of matter above nuclear saturation. Approximate modeling of\nneutrinos remains an important limitation to our ability to make predictions\nfor these observables. Part of the problem is the fermionic nature of\nneutrinos. By the exclusion principle, the expected value $f_\\nu$ for the\nnumber of neutrinos in a quantum state is at most 1. Any process producing\nneutrinos is suppressed by a blocking factor $(1-f_\\nu)$. Recent simulations\nfocused on neutrino physics mostly use a gray two-moment scheme to evolve\nneutrinos. This evolves integrals of $f_\\nu$ over momentum space, preventing\ndirect calculations of blocking factors. Monte Carlo methods may be an\nattractive alternative, providing access to the full distribution of neutrinos.\nTheir current implementation is however inadequate to estimate $f_\\nu$: in our\nmost recent simulations, a single Monte Carlo packet causes, in the worst\ncases, estimates of $f_\\nu$ to jump from $f_\\nu=0$ to $f_\\nu\\sim 10^5$. While\nthis is concerning, this brazen violation of the fermionic nature of neutrinos\nhas been largely inconsequential as the interactions used in simulations avoid\ndirect calculations of $f_\\nu$.

While\ndeep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality\nreconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains\nchallenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches\nleveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often\nstruggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,\nwe introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet\npreprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new\nquaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply\napply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the\nconditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are\ndynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also\nleverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.\nExtensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method\nachieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing\napproaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will\nbe available after the revision process.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-05-01T06:17:33Z"}

The notion of a \\emph{distributed interactive proof} (DIP) was\nintroduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In this setting, the\nverifier consists of $n$ nodes connected by a communication graph $G$. The\nprover is a single entity that communicates with all nodes by short messages.\nThe goal is to verify that the graph $G$ satisfies a certain property (e.g.,\nplanarity) in a small number of rounds, and with a small communication bound,\ndenoted as the \\emph{proof size}.\n  Prior work by Naor, Parter and Yogev (SODA 2020) presented a DIP for\nplanarity that uses three interaction rounds and a proof size of $O(\\log n)$.\nFeuilloley et al.\\ (PODC 2020) showed that the same can be achieved with a\nsingle interaction round and without randomization, by providing a proof\nlabeling scheme with a proof size of $O(\\log n)$.

There are a number of barriers to the\ncollisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift,\nor metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to\ncause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs,\npotentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from\nthe disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that\nexplore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is\nmassive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density\nwaves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and\nfind that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an\norder of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid\nparticles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to\nsufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo\ndirect gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically\nbetween $1$ and $10$ M$_\\oplus$.
