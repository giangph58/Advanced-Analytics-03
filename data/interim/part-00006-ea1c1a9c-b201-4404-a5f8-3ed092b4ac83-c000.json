However, the adoption of computing\nin these domains is hindered by strict area and power constraints, limiting the\neffectiveness of general-purpose microprocessors. This paper proposes a bespoke\nmicroprocessor design approach to address these challenges, by tailoring the\ndesign to specific applications and eliminating unnecessary logic. Targeting\nmachine learning applications, we further optimize core operations by\nintegrating a SIMD MAC unit supporting 4 precision configurations that boost\nthe efficiency of microprocessors. Our evaluation across 6 ML models and the\nlarge-scale Zero-Riscy core, shows that our methodology can achieve\nimprovements of 22.2%, 23.6%, and 33.79% in area, power, and speed,\nrespectively, without compromising accuracy. Against state-of-the-art printed\nprocessors, our approach can still offer significant speedups, but along with\nsome accuracy degradation.

Low robustness to link failures is also incurred without\nconsidering imperfect prediction. To build continual paths between VUEs and BSs\nfor QoS provision of cloud service, a robust predictive routing framework\n(ROPE) is proposed with three major components: 1) an early warning scheme\ndetects V2I link deterioration in advance via predicting vehicle mobility and\nlink signal strength to facilitate seamless path switchover; 2) a virtual\nrouting mechanism finds top3 paths that have the highest path strength and\nsatisfy the connectivity and hop count constraints based on the prediction\nresults to fulfill QoS requirements of cloud service; 3) a path verification\nprotocol checks availability and quality of the top3 paths shortly before\nswitchover and activates one qualified path for switchover to ensure routing\nrobustness.

As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes\nare instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background\ngeometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble\nD3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero\nform as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super\nYang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining\nYang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the\nconfined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on\n$S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic\noperator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation\nfunction of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic\nspectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined\ncorrelation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our\nmodel is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective\ninteraction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the\ncoupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation\nfrom the large N field theory.

We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a\nmarginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in\nJ2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to\nestimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\\rm IBS} \\sim 40-100$ G and place lower\nbounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the\nmagnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond\npulsar magnetospheres.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE,physics.plasm-ph","published":"2025-03-31T17:59:46Z"}

We post-process these events with dust radiative transfer\ncalculations to make predictions about their spectral energy distributions and\ncontinuum maps in the JWST to ALMA wavelength range. We compare the spectra\narising from galaxies hosting the merging MBHs with those arising from AGN\npowered by single accreting BHs.

Existing works generally focus on collecting\nextensive domain-specific data and directly tuning the original CLIP models.\nIntuitively, such a paradigm takes no full consideration of the characteristics\nlying in domain-specific data (e.g., fine-grained nature of biological data)\nand so limits model capability, while mostly losing the original ability of\nCLIP in the general domain. In this paper, we propose a Distribution\nAlignment-based Language-Image Pre-Training (DALIP) method for biological data.\nSpecifically, DALIP optimizes CLIP models by matching the similarity between\nfeature distribution of image-text pairs instead of the original [cls] token,\nwhich can capture rich yet effective information inherent in image-text pairs\nas powerful representations, and so better cope with fine-grained nature of\nbiological data.

Traditional ER methods use\nbatch processing, which becomes impractical with growing data volumes due to\nhigh computational costs and lack of real-time capabilities. In many\napplications, users need to resolve entities for only a small portion of their\ndata, making full data processing unnecessary -- a scenario known as\n\"ER-on-demand\". This paper proposes FastER, an efficient ER-on-demand framework\nfor property graphs. Our approach uses graph differential dependencies (GDDs)\nas a knowledge encoding language to design effective filtering mechanisms that\nleverage both structural and attribute semantics of graphs.

As the transportation system becomes denser, different\nmodes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other,\ngiving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this\nstudy, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled\ntransportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a\none-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In\nthis system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with\nnon-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus\nthat partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform\nnumerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are\nto each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number\nof zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between\nthe global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves.\nIn contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We\ndeveloped a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that\ntwo distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability\nanalysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our\nresults show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when\nsharing only partial or no direct route overlaps.

Given the complex structure of dwarf galaxies, we\nused four different methods to derive SP radial profiles: two based on\nconcentric elliptical rings, and two exploiting the spatially resolved data.\nFor each method, we applied four approaches to calculate the inner ($0 \\leq\nR/R_e \\leq 1$) and outer ($0.75 \\leq R/R_e \\leq 1.5$) gradients of: luminosity-\nand mass-weighted age and stellar metallicity, dust attenuation, $D_{n4000}$\nindex, stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities, and\nspecific SFR.

However, existing discretization methods\nstill suffer from significant information loss, resulting in a notable\nperformance gap compared to continuous representations. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose two quantization-based discretization methods: Product\nQuantization (PQ) and Random Product Quantization (RPQ). PQ partitions the\noriginal feature space into multiple subspaces and independently quantizes each\nsub-vector, producing a fused set of discrete units that retain diverse\ninformation from different subspaces, thus mitigating the loss associated with\nsingle-cluster quantization. RPQ further enhances representation diversity by\nrandomly sampling a fixed proportion of feature dimensions multiple times to\nconstruct sub-vectors, thereby better capturing the variability in the data\ndistribution. Theoretical analysis shows that RPQ reduces the correlation\ncoefficient rho (where 0 <= rho <= 1) between sub-quantizers. Its quantization\nerror is lower-bounded by the product of rho and epsilon-kms, where epsilon-kms\ndenotes the quantization error of a single K-means quantizer. Experimental\nresults on a combined dataset built from LibriSpeech and ML-SUPERB show that PQ\nand RPQ outperform standard K-means discretization, achieving relative\nimprovements of 21.8 percent and 20.0 percent in WER on LibriSpeech, and 24.1\npercent and 19.6 percent in CER on ML-SUPERB, respectively.

The hydrodynamics is\ngoverned by three dimensionless numbers: the viscosity ratio, $\\mu^\\ast$, and\nthe external and internal Reynolds numbers, $\\Rey^e$ and $\\Rey^i$,\nrespectively. The drop-to-fluid density ratio is related to these parameters as\n$\\rho^\\ast=\\mu^\\ast \\Rey^i/\\Rey^e$. This study focuses on highly viscous\ndroplets with $\\mu^\\ast \\geq 5$, where wake instability is driven by the\nvorticity flux transferred from the droplet surface into the surrounding fluid.\nBy analysing the wake structure, we confirm that the onset of the external\nbifurcation is linked to the tilting of the azimuthal vorticity, $\\omega_\\phi$,\nin the wake and that the bifurcation occurs once the isocontours of\n$\\omega_\\phi$ align nearly perpendicular to the symmetry axis.

However,\ntheir practical application has been historically limited by low output power\nand the need for deep cryogenic cooling. In this work, we present a novel\ndesign for a continuous-wave diamond-based maser oscillator operating at about\n14.5 GHz and moderate cryogenic temperatures (about 180 K), achieving output\npower levels exceeding -30 dBm (1 microW). This performance represents a\ntwo-orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous diamond or ruby-based maser\noscillators.Our system integrates a high-Q (about 2460) compact metallic\nmicrowave cavity with optically pumped (111)-oriented NV-rich diamond crystals.\nThe cavity supports efficient light coupling and thermal dissipation, enabling\nsustained high-power optical excitation (>1 W) using cost-effective green LEDs.\nWe demonstrate stable maser operation with good spectral quality and validate\nits output through both frequency- and time-domain analysis with phase noise\ndata when operated in \"free running\" mode. Additionally, we provide phase noise\nestimations based on Leeson's model and show that, when coupled to a high-Q\nexternal resonator, such masers could approach thermally limited phase noise\nlevels. These predictions suggest strong potential for diamond masers to\noutperform traditional ruby-based or similar maser systems, especially given\ntheir ability to operate at higher temperatures using rugged, He-free Stirling\ncoolers. Despite current limitations related to frequency stability and jitter,\nthis work establishes diamond-based masers as promising candidates for\nnext-generation ultra-low phase noise microwave oscillators. Further\nengineering optimization - particularly in field stability, thermal regulation,\nand feedback locking - will be key to unlocking their full potential.","main_category":"cond-mat.other","categories":"cond-mat.other","published":"2025-04-09T13:02:43Z"}

In the vertically partitioned setting, data is\ndistributed among entities, with each holding only a subset of those features.\nA key challenge in this scenario is that computing distances between records\nrequires access to all distributed features, which may be privacy-sensitive and\ncannot be directly shared with other parties. The goal is to compute the joint\nclusters while preserving the privacy of each entity's dataset. Existing\nsolutions using secret sharing or garbled circuits implement privacy-preserving\nvariants of Lloyd's algorithm but incur high communication costs, scaling as\nO(nkt), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters, and t\nthe number of rounds. These methods become impractical for large datasets or\nseveral parties, limiting their use to LAN settings only. On the other hand, a\ndifferent line of solutions rely on differential privacy (DP) to outsource the\nlocal features of the parties to a central server. However, they often\nsignificantly degrade the utility of the clustering outcome due to excessive\nnoise. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on homomorphic\nencryption and DP, reducing communication complexity to O(n+kt). In our method,\nparties securely outsource their features once, allowing a computing party to\nperform clustering operations under encryption. DP is applied only to the\nclusters' centroids, ensuring privacy with minimal impact on utility. Our\nsolution clusters 100,000 two-dimensional points into five clusters using only\n73MB of communication, compared to 101GB for existing works, and completes in\njust under 3 minutes on a 100Mbps network, whereas existing works take over 1\nday. This makes our solution practical even for WAN deployments, all while\nmaintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext k-means algorithms.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T09:20:56Z"}

To do that, we\ntransform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio\nand obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market\nsecurity. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and\nvariances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means\nand variances of any market security. The decomposition of the market-based\nvariance of returns of the portfolio by its securities follows from the\nstructure of the time series of market trades of the portfolio as a single\nsecurity. The market-based decompositions of the portfolio's variances of\nprices and returns could help the managers of multi-billion portfolios and the\ndevelopers of large market and macroeconomic models like BlackRock's Aladdin,\nJP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of\nrandom markets.","main_category":"econ.GN","categories":"econ.GN,q-fin.EC,q-fin.GN,q-fin.PM,q-fin.PR","published":"2025-04-10T17:44:57Z"}

Pristine mono- or\nfew-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice,\nmaking the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked\ngraphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and\nmirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically\nswitchable dipoles. ABCB graphene represents the simplest natural graphene\npolytype exhibiting intrinsic out-of-plane polarization, arising from\nasymmetric charge carrier distribution across its layers. Here, we report\nrobust ferroelectric behavior in dual-gated, non-aligned ABCB tetralayer\ngraphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The device exhibits\npronounced hysteresis in resistance under both top and bottom gate modulation,\nwith the effect persisting up to room temperature.

Despite\nthis, conventional DCS suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single\nacquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by\nthe high peak power of mode-locked pulses, necessitating coherent averaging.\nConsequently, averaging numerous interferograms compromises both the\nexceptional time resolution and places greater demands on long-term mutual\ncoherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to\nenhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in\ncoherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs\nwith mode spacing of $\\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition\nrate of $\\sim$250 MHz.

Many recent works mostly focus on classical\nsimulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues\nlike observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain\nunsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum\nhardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to\nimplement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer.\nHardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density\ndistribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented.\nFurthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform\nadvection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability\nof success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple\ntimesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by\nthe advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the\nexplicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent\nthe initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation,\nsignificantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit\ndepth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators.\nCollectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D\nQLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,physics.comp-ph","published":"2025-04-15T05:02:41Z"}

When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the\nincrease in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency.\n  In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, generalizing\nprevious results on $n=1$ (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of $n$.\nAssuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and\nreceiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching\ncapabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have\nsuffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their\nsensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe\nconstruction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss\nchange identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses.\nWe then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule,\nwhich allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the lossy links\nusing our constructed probes.

However, the mechanisms driving the\nevolution of cooperative behavior remain poorly understood, particularly in the\ncontext of simultaneous interactions involving multiple individuals, repeated\nencounters, and complex interaction structures. Here, we introduce a novel\nframework for studying repeated multi-player interactions in structured\npopulations -- repeated multi-player games on hypergraphs -- where multiple\nindividuals within each hyperedge engage in a repeated game, and each player\ncan simultaneously participate in many games. We focus on public goods games,\nwhere individuals differ in their initial endowments, their allocation of\nendowments across games, and their productivity, which determines the impact of\ntheir contributions. Through Nash equilibrium analysis, we reveal the intricate\ninterplay between full cooperation (all individuals contribute their entire\nendowments, maximizing collective benefits) and key factors such as initial\nendowments, productivity, contribution strategies, and interaction structure.\nNotably, while equal endowments are most effective in promoting full\ncooperation in homogeneous hypergraphs, they can hinder cooperation in\nheterogeneous hypergraphs, suggesting that equal endowments are not universally\noptimal. To address this, we propose two optimization strategies: one for\npolicymakers to adjust endowment distributions and another for players to\nmodify their contribution strategies. Both approaches successfully promote full\ncooperation across all studied hypergraphs.

In the context of weak supervision,\nclinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its\nsparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models\n(VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the\nexplanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices,\nwe propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language\nsupervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that\ngaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain\nwhy those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first\nlearns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion\nmorphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The\nteacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale\nfeature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2)\nConfidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions;\n(3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas.

Current\nmethods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry\nprimarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally\nDerived Bathymetry (SDB). However, SDB methods often require extensive manual\nfieldwork or costly reference data, while SfM-MVS approaches face challenges\neven after refraction correction. These include depth data gaps and noise in\nenvironments with homogeneous visual textures, which hinder the creation of\naccurate and complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed. To address\nthese challenges, this work introduces a methodology that combines the\nhigh-fidelity 3D reconstruction capabilities of the SfM-MVS methods with\nstate-of-the-art refraction correction techniques, along with the spectral\nanalysis capabilities of a new deep learning-based method for bathymetry\nprediction.

By considering this problem through the lens of the\ngeneralized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is\nindifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape, we can define a\ncontainment query that is robust to model watertightness. Applying contemporary\ntechniques for the 3D GWN on arbitrary curved surfaces would require some form\nof geometric discretization, potentially inducing containment\nmisclassifications near boundary components.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12218v1","title":"Accountable Liveness","summary":"Safety and liveness are the two classical security properties of consensus\nprotocols. Recent works have strengthened safety with accountability: should\nany safety violation occur, a sizable fraction of adversary nodes can be proven\nto be protocol violators. This paper studies to what extent analogous\naccountability guarantees are achievable for liveness. To reveal the full\ncomplexity of this question, we introduce an interpolation between the\nclassical synchronous and partially-synchronous models that we call the\n$x$-partially-synchronous network model in which, intuitively, at most an $x$\nfraction of the time steps in any sufficiently long interval are asynchronous\n(and, as with a partially-synchronous network, all time steps are synchronous\nfollowing the passage of an unknown \"global stablization time\"). We prove a\nprecise characterization of the parameter regime in which accountable liveness\nis achievable: if and only if $x < 1/2$ and $f < n/2$, where $n$ denotes the\nnumber of nodes and $f$ the number of nodes controlled by an adversary. We\nfurther refine the problem statement and our analysis by parameterizing by the\nnumber of violating nodes identified following a liveness violation, and\nprovide evidence that the guarantees achieved by our protocol are near-optimal\n(as a function of $x$ and $f$).

In a three-class\ndisease setting, the volume under the receiver operating characteristic surface\nand the three-class Youden index are commonly used summary measures of a\nbiomarker's discriminatory ability. However, these measures rely on a\nstochastic ordering assumption for the distributions of biomarker outcomes\nacross the three groups.

To address these challenges and\ncomplement existing measures, we propose the underlap coefficient, a novel\nsummary index of a biomarker's ability to distinguish between three (or more)\ndisease groups, and study its properties.

The conducted research identified three main types of\nquadratic (square root) voting. Two of them pertain to voting with a split\nstake, and one involves voting without splitting. In split stakes, Type 1 QV\napplies the square root to the total stake before distributing it among\npreferences, while Type 2 QV distributes the stake first and then applies the\nsquare root. In unsplit stakes (Type 3 QV), the square root of the total stake\nis allocated entirely to each preference. The presented formal proofs confirm\nthat Types 2 and 3 QV, along with generalized models, enhance decentralization\nas measured by the Gini and Nakamoto coefficients. A pivotal discovery is the\nexistence of a threshold stakeholder whose relative voting ratio increases\nunder QV compared to linear voting, while smaller stakeholders also gain\ninfluence. The generalized QV model allows flexible adjustment of this\nthreshold, enabling tailored decentralization levels.

However, current VQAs\nsuch as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower\nperformance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and\nsuffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We\npropose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard\nVQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while\navoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone\nVQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut\nproblem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of\nthe 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation\nprocedure. Finally, these performance guarantees are verified by numerical\nsimulations and hardware demonstrations on IBM quantum devices. In a 72-qubit\ndemonstration, the single-round light-cone VQA achieves the exact MaxCut\nsolution whereas the $p$-round QAOA with $p=1,2,3$ only obtains approximate\nsolutions.

In particular, some tools\nhave been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a\nstandard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex\nproteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square\nDeviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between\natoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of\nidentical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a\nsolvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding\nthe optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering\nschemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular\nconfigurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By\nconsidering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an\nautomated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The\nprogram capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems\nranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in\ndifferent solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different\nparameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the\nrepresentativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical\nproperties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to\ncluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond\nsolute-solvent systems.","main_category":"physics.comp-ph","categories":"physics.comp-ph","published":"2025-04-21T09:12:00Z"}

We present a computational method for determining\nprotein mass density that explicitly incorporates hydration effects. Our\napproach uses molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the volume of solvent\nexcluded by a protein. Applied to a dataset of 260 soluble proteins, this\nyields an average density of 1.296 g cm-3, notably lower than the widely cited\nvalue of 1.35 g cm-3. Contrary to previous suggestions, we find no correlation\nbetween protein density and molecular weight. We instead find correlations with\nresidue composition, particularly with hydrophobic amino acid content. Using\nthese correlations, we train a regressor capable of accurately predicting\nprotein density from sequence-derived features alone. Examining the effect of\nincorporating water molecules on the measured density, we find that water\nmolecules buried in internal cavities have a negligible effect, whereas those\nat the surface have a profound impact. Furthermore, by calculating the density\nof a titin domain and of the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin over molecular dynamics\ntrajectories, we show that individual proteins can occupy states with close but\ndistinguishable densities. Finally, we analyse the density of water in the\nvicinity of proteins, showing that the first two hydration shells exhibit\nhigher density than bulk water. When included in cumulative density\ncalculations, these hydration layers contribute to a net increase in local\nsolvent density.

The observed dominant signal at the second harmonic of the\norbital frequency also suggests ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary in this\nsystem. The observed double-peaked spin pulse profile in [PK2008] HalphaJ115927\nlikely results from two-pole accretion, where both poles contribute to the spin\nmodulation, and their geometry allows equal visibility of both accreting poles.\nIn contrast, IGR J14091-610 exhibits a single-peaked sinusoidal like spin\npulse, attributed to the changing visibility of the accretion curtains due to a\nrelatively low dipole inclination.

For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase\ndiagrams.

Two-dimensional materials, particularly\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have attracted significant attention due to\ntheir exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties.

However, due to\nlimitations in existing training methods and inherent model constraints, SNNs\noften exhibit a performance gap when compared to Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs). Knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored as a technique to\ntransfer knowledge from ANN teacher models to SNN student models to mitigate\nthis gap. Traditional KD methods typically use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nto align output distributions. However, conventional KL-based approaches fail\nto fully exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs, as they tend to\noveremphasize high-probability predictions while neglecting low-probability\nones, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address this, we propose\nHead-Tail Aware Kullback-Leibler (HTA-KL) divergence, a novel KD method for\nSNNs. HTA-KL introduces a cumulative probability-based mask to dynamically\ndistinguish between high- and low-probability regions. It assigns adaptive\nweights to ensure balanced knowledge transfer, enhancing the overall\nperformance. By integrating forward KL (FKL) and reverse KL (RKL) divergence,\nour method effectively align both head and tail regions of the distribution.

This occurs in a broad range of applications such as those involving\nbiological objects like algae, ultra-thin graphene flakes, or colloidal\nsuspensions. It is known that articles with two planes of symmetry can be\ncategorised as ``settlers'', ``drifters'' or ``flutterers'', where the latter\nsediment along chiral trajectories despite their achiral shapes. Here we\nanalyse the sedimentation of circular disks bent into a U-shape\n(``flutterers'') and show how their behaviour changes when we break one of\ntheir symmetries by pinching the disks along their axis. The ``fluttering''\nbehaviour is found to be robust to such shape changes, with the trajectories\nnow evolving towards helical paths. However, the behaviour changes when the\ndegree of pinching becomes too strong, at which point the particles become\n``drifters'' which sediment steadily without rotation. We establish criteria\nfor the transition between the two types of behaviour and confirm our\npredictions in experiments. Finally, we discuss the implications of our\nobservations for the dispersion of dilute suspensions made of such particles.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-30T06:21:12Z"}

In\nthis work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to\nsimultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior\ninformation through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior\nfeatures, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating\nmechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is\nutilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling.

However, the detailed mechanisms by which flux\nemergence drives these eruptions remain unclear and require numerical\ninvestigation. Using 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we\ninvestigate the interaction between emerging flux and background magnetic\nfields and dynamics of the induced eruptions. By systematically varying the\nstrength and angle of the emerging magnetic field relative to the background\nfield, we investigate its impact on the initiation and evolution of solar\neruptions. The simulations show that magnetic reconnection between the emerging\nflux and background field drives the formation of current sheets, magnetic\nislands and multithermal jets. Stronger magnetic fields result in earlier\neruptions, more energetic jets, and enhanced heating. The formation and\nejection of magnetic islands affect the structure and dynamics of the jet. When\nthe hot and cool components of jets reach the other footpoint of magnetic\nloops, they will generate spicules near the transition region. Varying the\nangle between the emerging flux and the background field, we find that larger\nangles delay filament ascent and eruption timing but facilitate filament\nformation. Filaments form a hot shell and oscillate with a period of 10 minutes\ndriven by periodic plasma ejections. Repetitive reconnection events inject cold\nplasma into the self-consistently formed filament channel, introducing a new\nprominence formation mechanism by flux-emergence-fed injection. Our analysis\nhighlights the dynamic interplay between magnetic reconnection, plasma cooling\nand heating, and filament dynamics.

We investigate various migration mechanisms for young\nplanets close to young stars. To quantify the stochastic migration driven by\nturbulent disks, we incorporate planets into existing 3-D MHD disk simulations\nof magnetospheric accretion. Besides the stochastic torque, we identify\nperiodic torques from slowly evolving disk substructures farther out. We\nquantify these turbulent torques analytically using a modified Gaussian\nprocess. Then, using the disk structure in our simulation, we calculate\nmigration timescales of various processes, including the smooth Type I/II\nmigration, planet-star tidal interaction, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction,\nunipolar induction, and aerodynamical drag with the magnetosphere. Since our\ninner MHD turbulent disk reveals a very low surface density ($\\sim 0.01$\ng/cm$^{2}$), the resulting disk migration is significantly slower than\npreviously estimated. Earth-mass planets have the migration timescale in the\ninner MHD turbulent disk exceeding the Hubble time, effectively stalling at the\ndeadzone inner boundary ($R_{\\mathrm{DZIB}}$). Only giant planets could migrate\ninward within the turbulent disk, and may stall at the magnetospheric\ntruncation radius ($R_T$).

To\nsimultaneously account for the observed $5\\sigma$ deviation in muon $g-2$ and\nthe correct DM relic abundance, the DM candidate in the MSSM must be bino-like:\nwino- or higgsino-like neutralinos require TeV-scale masses to avoid\nunderabundance, rendering the electroweakino spectrum too heavy to yield a\nsizable $g-2$ contribution.

Theoretically, we establish parametric convergence rates for the\ntrimmed MSW distance and prove that the ABI posterior converges to the true\nposterior as the tolerance threshold vanishes. Through extensive empirical\nevaluation, we demonstrate that ABI significantly outperforms data-based\nWasserstein ABC, summary-based ABC, and state-of-the-art likelihood-free\nsimulators, especially in high-dimensional or dependent observation regimes.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME,cs.LG,stat.CO,stat.ML","published":"2025-05-07T17:50:14Z"}

To address this\nissue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars\nto FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson\nparticle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs\nand explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q\nrelations.

To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition\n(SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with\nmultiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map\nmatching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings\nand scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First,\nthe lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated\nwith the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the\nenriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative\nClosest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability\nfactor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the\nassociation probability between adjacent lanes and roads.

Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted\nby ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is\nH-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and\njoining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k\nvertices.

In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges\nof the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star\nin the hypercube remains unexplored.

This work\npresents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of its two-dimensional (2D)\ncounterpart, Vivianene, focusing on its structural, electronic, and optical\nproperties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we evaluate its thermodynamic stability,\nband structure, density of states, and optical response. Our results confirm\nthat Vivianene retains the main structural features of bulk Vivianite while\nexhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability at room temperature. The electronic\nstructure analysis reveals an indirect bandgap of 3.03 eV for Vivianene, which\nis slightly lower than the 3.21 eV observed for bulk Vivianite, deviating from\nthe expected quantum confinement trend in 2D materials. The projected density\nof states (PDOS) analysis indicates that Fe d orbitals predominantly contribute\nto the valence and conduction bands. Optical calculations demonstrate that\nVivianene exhibits a higher optical band gap (3.6 eV) than bulk Vivianite (3.2\neV), with significant absorption in the ultraviolet region. The refractive\nindex and reflectivity analyses suggest that most of the incident light is\nabsorbed rather than reflected, reinforcing its potential for optoelectronic\napplications.

Their high abundance at redshifts of\n$z\\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We\npropose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black\nhole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded\nin a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\\lesssim 10^3$\nSchwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\\simeq 5000~{\\rm K}$ blackbody\nspectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical\nemission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out\na gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover\nwavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario\nnaturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation\n($A_V\\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in\nprevious studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument.\nThis model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays\nthrough binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking\nearly-stage \"proto-LRD\" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage\n\"LRD-descendants\" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-05-08T15:08:46Z"}

To satisfy the constraint made by ACT, we will\ninvestigate the Starobinsky potential within the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB)\ngravity theory. EGB gravity is motivated by the higher-dimensional theory,\nwhich includes quadratic curvature correction terms and a coupling between the\nscalar field and the GB term that modifies the dynamical equations. The model\nis considered by using the slow-roll approximation method and the exact\nnumerical approach for two different coupling functions. The results indicate\nthat the model is in good agreement with the data and the results stand in\n$1\\sigma$ of the ACT $r-n_s$ plane. Considering the running of the scalar\nspectral index also implies the consistency of the model with data. In\naddition, the parametric space of the free parameters of the EGB coupling is\nexplored, where we find the acceptable region of the parameters in which the\nresulting $n_s$ and $r$ stay in $1\\sigma$ of the ACT data.

Most of these\nmodels assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent,\nmotivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a\nscaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated\nSFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a\nsemi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated\nto match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model\nthe impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of\nobserved galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters,\nsuch as the fraction of gas in dense clouds $f_{\\rm dense}$, our new models\neasily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at $z\\sim\n6$-17. While no single value of $f_{\\rm dense}$ is able to reproduce the very\nshallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at $z\\gtrsim 12$, it is\nplausible and even expected for $f_{\\rm dense}$ to have some effective\ndependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement\nwith the data.
