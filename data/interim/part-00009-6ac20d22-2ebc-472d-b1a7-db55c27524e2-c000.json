This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on\nLLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is\nde-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational\ndecisions. The research methods include enabling the model to \"read the board,\"\n\"understand the rules,\" \"select strategies,\" and \"evaluate positions,\" while\nen-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The\nresults demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of\nmove positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces\npro-cess time through parallel position evaluation.

Existing approaches, which mostly\ndepend on large language models (LLMs), suffer from semantic ambiguities,\nlimited structural context understanding, and insufficient reasoning\ncapability. To address these limitations, we propose KGCompass with two\ninnovations: (1) a novel repository-aware knowledge graph (KG) that accurately\nlinks repository artifacts (issues and pull requests) and codebase entities\n(files, classes, and functions), allowing us to effectively narrow down the\nvast search space to only 20 most relevant functions with accurate candidate\nbug locations and contextual information, and (2) a path-guided repair\nmechanism that leverages KG-mined entity path, tracing through which allows us\nto augment LLMs with relevant contextual information to generate precise\npatches along with their explanations. Experimental results in the\nSWE-Bench-Lite demonstrate that KGCompass achieves state-of-the-art repair\nperformance (45.67%) and function-level localization accuracy (51.33%) across\nopen-source approaches, costing only $0.20 per repair.

The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary\ncompanion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely\nuncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations\nof massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding\nobserved populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse\n53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models\ninclude the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic\ninternal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover\ninitial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all\ninitial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the\nfirst mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray\nbinary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence.\nResults.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are\npost-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models,\nthe mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model\nunderpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the\nmain features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of\nSMC binary WR stars.

While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many\nphysics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large\nnumber of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower\nmerger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass\ntransfer.

However, the primary goal of any dimensional reduction technique is\nto reduce the dimensionality in a data set while keeping the essential\ninformation and variability.

SAEs\nare based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the\nrepresentations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the\nsuperposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in\nthe model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal\ndefinitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the\nlatent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be\napproximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error\nbound.

Despite recent progress by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to\nextend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable\nlimitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate\nabout whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic\ngeneralization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches\ndesigned for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However,\nthese insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their\napplicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend the\napproach of meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract\nspatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\\textit{SYGAR}$-a dataset\ndesigned to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from\nknown geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of\ntwo-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g.,\ntranslation+rotation).

However, it is not clear whether other sources contribute, especially\nin the early Universe. We discuss variations of the surface abundances of\nfluorine coming from our massive star models and compare them with available\npresent-day observations. We compute the contribution of massive stars in\nproducing 19F over metallicities covering the whole cosmic history. We used\nmodels in the mass range of 9Msol < Mini < 300Msol at metallicities from Pop\nIII up to super-solar while accounting for the required nuclear network to\nfollow the evolution of 19F during the core H- and He-burning phases. Results\nfrom models with and without rotational mixing are presented. We find that\nrotating models predict a slight depletion of fluorine at their surface at the\nend of the MS phase. In more advanced evolutionary phases, only models with an\ninitial mass larger than 25Msol at metallicities Z > 0.014 show phases where\nthe abundance of fluorine is enhanced. This occurs when the star is a WR star\nof the WC type. WC stars can show surface abundances of fluorine ten times\nlarger than their initial abundance. However, we obtained that the winds of\nmassive stars at metallicities larger than Z=0.006 do not significantly\ncontribute to fluorine production, confirming previous findings. In contrast,\nvery metal-poor rapidly rotating massive star models may be important sources\nof fluorine through the mass expelled at the time of their SN explosion.\nObservations of WC stars at solar or super-solar metallicities may provide very\ninteresting indications on the nuclear pathways that lead to fluorine\nproduction in massive stars.

The simulation\nresults are interpreted from three key perspectives: the density gradient,\nwhich characterizes the spatial variation in density; the thermodynamic\nnon-equilibrium strength, which quantifies the system's deviation from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium; and the fraction of non-equilibrium regions, which\ncaptures the spatial distribution of non-equilibrium behaviors. Notably, the\nfluid system exhibits rich and diverse dynamic patterns resulting from the\ninterplay of multiple competing physical mechanisms, including time-dependent\nacceleration, RT instability, diffusion, and dissipation effects. These\nfindings provide deeper insights into the evolution and regulation of\ncompressible RT instability under complex driving conditions.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-07T14:32:33Z"}

Mainstream motion-appearance approaches\nuse either the two-encoder structure to separately encode motion and appearance\nfeatures, or the single-encoder structure for joint encoding. However, these\nmethods fail to properly balance the motion-appearance relationship.\nConsequently, even with complex fusion modules for motion-appearance\nintegration, the extracted suboptimal features degrade the models' overall\nperformance. Moreover, the quality of optical flow varies across scenarios,\nmaking it insufficient to rely solely on optical flow to achieve high-quality\nsegmentation results. To address these challenges, we propose the Intrinsic\nSaliency guided Trunk-Collateral Net}work (ISTC-Net), which better balances the\nmotion-appearance relationship and incorporates model's intrinsic saliency\ninformation to enhance segmentation performance. Specifically, considering that\noptical flow maps are derived from RGB images, they share both commonalities\nand differences. We propose a novel Trunk-Collateral structure. The shared\ntrunk backbone captures the motion-appearance commonality, while the collateral\nbranch learns the uniqueness of motion features. Furthermore, an Intrinsic\nSaliency guided Refinement Module (ISRM) is devised to efficiently leverage the\nmodel's intrinsic saliency information to refine high-level features, and\nprovide pixel-level guidance for motion-appearance fusion, thereby enhancing\nperformance without additional input.

Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models\ndirectly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and\nthus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of\navailable data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective\nanomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address\nthis challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies,\nrequiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the\ntraining and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of\nmultiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly\neffective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning\nmodels. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased\ncomputational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world\napplications.

This (meta-)concept is connected to\nintermediate concepts by a possibilistic rule-based system. The probability of\neach intermediate concept for the input instance is inferred using a neural\nnetwork. The connection between the low-level perception task and the\nhigh-level reasoning task lies in the transformation of neural network outputs\nmodeled by probability distributions (through softmax activation) into\npossibility distributions. The use of intermediate concepts is valuable for the\nexplanation purpose: using the rule-based system, the classification of an\ninput instance as an element of the (meta-)concept can be justified by the fact\nthat intermediate concepts have been recognized.\n  From the technical side, our contribution consists of the design of efficient\nmethods for defining the matrix relation and the equation system associated\nwith a possibilistic rule-based system.

Typically, current open-source MLLMs\nrely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful\ngenerations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for\nmulti-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to\nvision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize\na carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while\nthe specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset\nremain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap\nprimarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response\nquality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution\nto boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the\nkey factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small\nset of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear\nrejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for\nlabor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can\nstill be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection\ndata exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not\nlost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction\nfinetuning.

Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes\nduring exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving\nreconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted\nDeblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D\nGaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly\nlearns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion\ntrajectories during exposure time.

The removal of these redundant social relations is\ncrucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth.

Studies have explored various\ndata-compression approaches that retain critical diagnostic details in a\nlower-dimensional latent space. While conventional techniques can streamline\ndimensionality to some extent, they do not always capture the nonlinear\ninteractions typical of guided waves. Manifold learning, as illustrated by\nDiffusion Maps, tackles these nonlinearities by deriving low-dimensional\nembeddings directly from wave signals, minimizing the need for manual feature\nextraction. In parallel, developments in deep learning -- particularly\nautoencoders -- provide an encoder-decoder model for both data compression and\nreconstruction.

Contrary to the typically water-rich T\nTauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be\nwater-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In\nthis letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other\noxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the\nMIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS).

However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework\nexhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different\noutput spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the\nstudent model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different\nvocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors\nwith ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the\nstudent/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from\ndifferent models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the\ndistributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm\nto align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the\nabove, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both\noff-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their\nvocabularies.

The difficulty with $J_2$ is due to a background Ricci tensor term,\nwhich should be also canceled out by the fluid term or vanishing in absence of\nfluid. We also demonstrate these three candidates in a flat Robertson-Walker\nspacetime.

Also, we combined the\ncataloged stellar flares with the time evolution of starspots estimated by\nlight curves obtained by the 4-year Kepler mission for solar-type stars. For\nthe obtained 24124 solar flares and 180 stellar flares, we calculate the flare\noccurrence distribution with respect to $t_\\mathrm{flare}-t_\\mathrm{max}$,\nwhich represents the timing of flare through the spot evolution, where\n$t_\\mathrm{flare}$ is the flare occurrence time, and $t_\\mathrm{max}$ is the\ntime when the source spot takes its maximum area.

In this study we analyze the\nphysical processes of an overshoot of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation (AMOC), one of the major tipping elements, using a conceptual box\nmodel. Here either the atmospheric temperature above the North Atlantic, or the\nfreshwater forcing into the North Atlantic overshoot their respective critical\nboundaries. In both cases a higher forcing rate can prevent a collapse of the\nAMOC, since a higher rate of forcing causes initially a fresher North Atlantic,\nwhich in turn results in a higher northward transport by the subtropical gyre\nsupplementing the salinity loss in time. For small exceedance amplitudes the\nAMOC is still resilient as the forcing rates can be low and so other state\nvariables outside of the North Atlantic can adjust. Contrarily, for larger\novershoots the trajectories are dynamically similar and we find a lower limit\nin volume and exceedance time for respectively freshwater and temperature\nforcing in order to prevent a collapse. Moreover, for a large overshoot an\nincreased air-sea temperature coupling has a destabilizing effect, while the\nreverse holds for an overshoot close to the tipping point.

The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively\ncomplete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs\nand an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are\nbridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze\nuser queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT\nspecialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide\nactionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited\nto categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological\nexistential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query\nprocessing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as\nmetaphor usage in IT contexts.

Its quantization features a\nHamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators\ncharacterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized\nby the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in\na bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms\ncorresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, like, e.g., the\nelectric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two\ncontinua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an\ninfinite bulk medium.

Recent advancements in large language\nmodels (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in this task. However,\nprior studies have highlighted that LLMs often struggle with domain-specific\ncode, particularly in resolving cross-lingual API mappings. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose APIRAT, a novel code translation method that integrates\nmulti-source API knowledge. APIRAT employs three API knowledge augmentation\ntechniques, including API sequence retrieval, API sequence back-translation,\nand API mapping, to guide LLMs to translating code, ensuring both the correct\nstructure of API sequences and the accurate usage of individual APIs. Extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, CodeNet and AVATAR, indicate that APIRAT\nsignificantly surpasses existing LLM-based methods, achieving improvements in\ncomputational accuracy ranging from 4% to 15.1%. Additionally, our evaluation\nacross different LLMs showcases the generalizability of APIRAT.

While\nrecent approaches employ pseudo labels for training, three key challenges:\ngenerating high-quality pseudo labels, making full use of different priors, and\noptimizing training methods with noisy labels remain unresolved.

When modelling systems where interactions extend beyond node pairs to\ninvolve arbitrary numbers of nodes, hypergraphs become necessary, creating a\nneed for specialised community detection methods. Here, we adapt the classical\n$k$-clique percolation method to hypergraphs, building communities from\nhyperedges containing at least $k$ nodes, defining hyperedge adjacency\nsimilarly to clique adjacency in the original algorithm. Although the analogy\nbetween the proposed hyperedge percolation method and the classical clique\npercolation algorithm is evident, we show that communities obtained directly\nfrom the hyperedges can differ from those identified by the clique percolation\nmethod in the pairwise projection of the hypergraph.

Previous studies have explored\ntraditional methods and Siamese networks for UAOT. However, the absence of a\nunified evaluation benchmark has significantly constrained the value of these\nmethods. To alleviate this limitation, we propose the first large-scale UAOT\nbenchmark, SonarT165, comprising 165 square sequences, 165 fan sequences, and\n205K high-quality annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that SonarT165\nreveals limitations in current state-of-the-art SOT trackers.

Our approach seeks to bridge the\nknowledge gap of the intricacies of CDPRs due to aspects such as cable sag and\nprecision control necessities by establishing a simulation platform that\ncaptures the real-world behaviors of CDPRs, including the impacts of cable sag.\nThe framework offers researchers and developers a tool to further develop\nestimation and control strategies within the simulation for understanding and\npredicting the performance nuances, especially in complex operations where\ncable sag can be significant. Using this simulation framework, we train a\nmodel-free control policy in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This approach is\nchosen for its capability to adaptively learn from the complex dynamics of\nCDPRs. The policy is trained to discern optimal cable control inputs, ensuring\nprecise end-effector positioning. Unlike traditional feedback-based control\nmethods, our RL control policy focuses on kinematic control and addresses the\ncable sag issues without being tethered to predefined mathematical models. We\nalso demonstrate that our RL-based controller, coupled with the flexible cable\nsimulation, significantly outperforms the classical kinematics approach,\nparticularly in dynamic conditions and near the boundary regions of the\nworkspace. The combined strength of the described simulation and control\napproach offers an effective solution in manipulating suspended CDPRs even at\nworkspace boundary conditions where traditional approach fails, as proven from\nour experiments, ensuring that CDPRs function optimally in various applications\nwhile accounting for the often neglected but critical factor of cable sag.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO","published":"2025-04-22T09:45:06Z"}

A key metric for functional safety is achieving a sufficient\nfault coverage. To meet this requirement, extensive time-consuming fault\nsimulation of the RTL code is necessary during the chip design phase.The main\noverhead in RTL fault simulation comes from simulating behavioral nodes (always\nblocks). Due to the limited fault propagation capacity, fault simulation\nresults often match the good simulation results for many behavioral nodes. A\nkey strategy for accelerating RTL fault simulation is the identification and\nelimination of redundant simulations. Existing methods detect redundant\nexecutions by examining whether the fault inputs to each RTL node are\nconsistent with the good inputs. However, we observe that this input comparison\nmechanism overlooks a significant amount of implicit redundant execution:\nalthough the fault inputs differ from the good inputs, the node's execution\nresults remain unchanged. Our experiments reveal that this overlooked redundant\nexecution constitutes nearly half of the total execution overhead of behavioral\nnodes, becoming a significant bottleneck in current RTL fault simulation. The\nunderlying reason for this overlooked redundancy is that, in these cases, the\ntrue execution paths within the behavioral nodes are not affected by the\nchanges in input values. In this work, we propose a behavior-level redundancy\ndetection algorithm that focuses on the true execution paths.

Existing methods have notable limitations: textual approaches offer\nhigh-level semantic guidance but struggle to describe complex actions\naccurately; trajectory-based techniques provide intuitive global motion\ndirection yet often fall short in generating precise or customized character\nmovements; and anchor poses-guided methods are typically confined to synthesize\nonly simple motion patterns. To generate more controllable and precise human\nmotions, we propose \\textbf{ProMoGen (Progressive Motion Generation)}, a novel\nframework that integrates trajectory guidance with sparse anchor motion\ncontrol. Global trajectories ensure consistency in spatial direction and\ndisplacement, while sparse anchor motions only deliver precise action guidance\nwithout displacement. This decoupling enables independent refinement of both\naspects, resulting in a more controllable, high-fidelity, and sophisticated\nmotion synthesis. ProMoGen supports both dual and single control paradigms\nwithin a unified training process. Moreover, we recognize that direct learning\nfrom sparse motions is inherently unstable, we introduce \\textbf{SAP-CL (Sparse\nAnchor Posture Curriculum Learning)}, a curriculum learning strategy that\nprogressively adjusts the number of anchors used for guidance, thereby enabling\nmore precise and stable convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nProMoGen excels in synthesizing vivid and diverse motions guided by predefined\ntrajectory and arbitrary anchor frames. Our approach seamlessly integrates\npersonalized motion with structured guidance, significantly outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods across multiple control scenarios.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-23T13:51:42Z"}

Specifically, substantial channel\nmeasurement campaigns with distances up to 410~m are conducted at 220~GHz, with\nnanosecond-level absolute time synchronization. Based on the measurement\nresults, the propagation phenomena are analyzed in detail and the channel\ncharacteristics are calculated and statistically modeled. Furthermore, a\ndigital twin enabled channel model (DTECM) is proposed, which generates THz\nchannel responses in a hybrid manner. Specifically, the dominant paths are\ngenerated deterministically by using the ray-tracing technique and CV methods.\nApart from the path gains determined by ray-tracing, the additional foliage\nloss is accurately modeled based on foliage information extracted from\npanoramic pictures. To maintain a low computational complexity for the DTECM,\nnon-dominant paths are then generated statistically. Numeric results reveal\nthat compared to the traditional statistical channel models, the DTECM reduces\nthe path loss modeling error from 14~dB to 4~dB, showing its great superiority.\nFurthermore, a preliminary link performance evaluation using the DTECM\nindicates that THz UMa is feasible, though requiring high antenna gains and\ncoverage extension techniques to achieve high spectral efficiencies and wide\ncoverage.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,math.IT","published":"2025-04-24T15:40:57Z"}

Thus, past work requires controlled settings such\nas known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes.\nInstead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object\nclasses. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset\nof natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object\nmeshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are\npaired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D\nbody. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To\ninfer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a\ndatabase by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body\ncontact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per\npatch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences\nbetween bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact\ncorrespondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit,\nto recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact\nfor the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db\nfor that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object\nmeshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for\nmany object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to\nenable HOI understanding to scale in the wild.

Customized automatic differentiation rules are defined by identifying\nthe VJP (vector-Jacobian product) structure in the chain rule and implemented\nusing adjoint-based implicit differentiation methods. Four numerical examples,\nincluding both 2D and 3D forward predictions and inverse parameter\nidentification, are presented to validate the accuracy and computational\nefficiency of DiffLiB.

Excessive redundancy leads to increased\nequipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational\nrequirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption.

This paper introduces a low-latency JackTrip\nframework designed to bridge both the cultural and digital divides in music\neducation. By leveraging an open-source, UDP-based audio streaming protocol\noriginally developed at Stanford's CCRMA, the framework is tailored to address\ntechnical constraints such as intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and\nhigh latency that characterize many rural and underserved regions. The study\nsystematically compares the performance of JackTrip with conventional platforms\nlike Zoom, demonstrating that JackTrip achieves sub-30~ms latency under\nsimulated low-resource conditions while preserving the intricate audio details\nessential for non-Western musical traditions. Spectral analysis confirms that\nJackTrip's superior handling of microtonal scales, complex rhythms, and\nharmonic textures provides a culturally authentic medium for real-time ensemble\nperformance and music education. These findings underscore the transformative\npotential of decentralized, edge-computing solutions in empowering educators\nand musicians across the Global South, promoting both technological equity and\ncultural preservation.","main_category":"cs.SD","categories":"cs.SD,cs.SI","published":"2025-05-01T14:27:47Z"}

Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a\ncommon approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality\ncombination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for\nclinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling\npre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained\nmodel seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting\nrich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy\noutperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate\npre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training\nfrom scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and\nefficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.\nCode and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/bmmae","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-05-01T14:51:30Z"}

Although seemingly simple, this temperature\ndependence is incompatible with the conventional theory of metals that dictates\nthat the scattering rate, $1/\\tau$, should be quadratic in temperature if\nelectron-electron scattering dominates. Understanding the origin of this\ntemperature dependence and its connection to superconductivity may provide the\nkey to pick the lock of high-temperature superconductivity. Using time-domain\nterahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) we elucidate the low temperature conducting\nbehavior of two FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (FTS) samples, one with almost equal amounts\nof Se and Te that is believed to be a topological superconductor, and one that\nis more overdoped. Constrained with DC resistivity, we find two conduction\nchannels that add in parallel, a broad one in frequency with weak temperature\ndependence and a sharper one whose scattering rate goes as the Planckian\nlimited rate, $\\sim kT/h$.

We employ probability density as the metric\nfor OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques,\ndemonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous\ntime flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that\ncombine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with\nnormalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as\nquantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC).
