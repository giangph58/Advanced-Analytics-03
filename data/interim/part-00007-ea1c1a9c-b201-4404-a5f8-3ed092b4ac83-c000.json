The in-line holography provides the temporal evolution of the\nvolumetric size distribution of child droplets formed during various\nfragmentation processes at different Weber numbers (We). The droplet undergoes\ndifferent fragmentation processes at significantly lower Weber numbers in\nopposed-flow configurations compared to cross-flow configurations. Our findings\nreveal distinct fragmentation modes, namely bag, bag-stamen, and dual-bag\nbreakup, observed at We=9.38, 16.9, and 18.9, respectively. At We = 9.38, the\ncombined effects of bag rupture, rim breakup, and node fragmentation generate\nchild droplets of varying sizes, driven by the interplay of the\nRayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. At We = 16.9, the\ninteraction of aerodynamic and shear forces leads to bag-stamen fragmentation,\ncharacterized by forming a stamen-like structure along with the bag. Both bag\nand bag-stamen breakups result in tri-modal size distributions. However, at We\n= 16.9, fewer tiny droplets are produced compared to the bag breakup observed\nat lower Weber numbers.

However, existing egocentric\ninteraction understanding methods cannot yield coherent textual and pixel-level\nresponses simultaneously according to user queries, which lacks flexibility for\nvarying downstream application requirements. To comprehend egocentric\ninteractions exhaustively, this paper presents a novel task named Egocentric\nInteraction Reasoning and pixel Grounding (Ego-IRG). Taking an egocentric image\nwith the query as input, Ego-IRG is the first task that aims to resolve the\ninteractions through three crucial steps: analyzing, answering, and pixel\ngrounding, which results in fluent textual and fine-grained pixel-level\nresponses. Another challenge is that existing datasets cannot meet the\nconditions for the Ego-IRG task.

Such a model does not necessarily assume\nthat past treatment is not associated with the outcome (the Markov property),\nsince it is possible to model the hazard conditional on only the current\ntreatment value. However, modeling the hazard conditional on the full treatment\nhistory is required in order to interpret the results causally, and such a full\nmodel assumes the Markov property when only including current treatment. This\nis, for example, common in marginal structural Cox models. We demonstrate that\nrelying on the Markov property is problematic, since it only holds in\nunrealistic settings or if the treatment has no causal effect.

Further, we provide an example of a scenario\nwhere the Markov property is not fulfilled, but the Cox model that includes\nonly current treatment as a covariate is correctly specified.

A key factor governing brain tissue\ndeformation and the risk of mTBI is the rotational kinematics of the head.\nInstrumented mouthguards are a widely accepted method for measuring rotational\nhead motions, owing to their robust sensor-skull coupling. However, wearing\nmouthguards is not feasible in all situations, especially for long-term data\ncollection. Therefore, alternative wearable devices are needed. In this study,\nwe present an improved design and data processing scheme for an instrumented\nheadband. Our instrumented headband utilizes an array of inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs) and a new data-processing scheme based on continuous wavelet\ntransforms to address sources of error in the IMU measurements. The headband\nperformance was evaluated in the laboratory on an anthropomorphic test device,\nwhich was impacted with a soccer ball to replicate soccer heading. When\ncomparing the measured peak rotational velocities (PRV) and peak rotational\naccelerations (PRA) between the reference sensors and the headband for impacts\nto the front of the head, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0.80 and 0.63,\nand the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 0.20 and 0.28,\nrespectively. However, when considering all impact locations, r dropped to 0.42\nand 0.34 and NRMSE increased to 0.5 and 0.41 for PRV and PRA, respectively.\nThis new instrumented headband improves upon previous headband designs in\nreconstructing the rotational head kinematics resulting from frontal soccer\nball impacts, providing a potential alternative to instrumented mouthguards.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-02T17:47:07Z"}

Here we present a\nnew homogeneous survey of 41 VLT/FLAMES multi-fibre spectroscopic pointings\nthat contain 2108 individual spectra, and combined with Gaia DR3 photometry and\nastrometry we present v-los measurements for 333 individual Red Giant Branch\nstars that are consistent with membership in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy. In addition, we provide the metallicity, [Fe/H], determined from the\ntwo strongest CaII triplet lines, for 312 of these stars. We look again at the\nglobal characteristics of Sextans, deriving a mean line-of-sight velocity of\n<v-los> = +227.1km/s and a mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -2.37. The\nmetallicity distribution is clearly double peaked, with the highest peak at\n[Fe/H]= -2.81 and another broader peak at [Fe/H]= -2.09. Thus it appears that\nSextans hosts two populations and the superposition leads to a radial variation\nin the mean metallicity, with the more metal rich population being centrally\nconcentrated. In addition there is an intriguing group of 9 probable members in\nthe outer region of Sextans at higher [Fe/H] than the mean in this region. If\nthis group could be confirmed as members they would eliminate the metallicity\ngradient. We also look again at the Colour-Magnitude Diagram of the resolved\nstellar population in Sextans. We also look again at the relation between\nSextans and the intriguingly nearby globular cluster, Pal3. The global\nproperties of Sextans have not changed significantly compared to previous\nstudies, but they are now more precise, and the sample of known members in the\nouter regions is now more complete.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-03T17:31:23Z"}

In the PDSs of\nthe LHS and HIMS, the broad-band noises are well fitted with three Lorentzian\ncomponents: a low-frequency component $L_1$, a middle-frequency component $L_2$\nand a high-frequency component $L_3$.

In this work, we develop a framework to analyze quantum\nenhanced interferometry with general Markovian quantum light sources. First, we\nshow how to compute the quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the photons emitted\nby a source efficiently by just tracking its internal dynamics and without\nexplicitly computing the state of the emitted photons. We then use this\nrelationship to elucidate the connection between the level structure and\nspectrum of the source to a potential quantum advantage in interferometry.\nFinally, we analyze optimal measurement protocols that can be used to achieve\nthis quantum advantage with experimentally available optical elements. In\nparticular, we show that tunable optical elements with Kerr non-linearity can\nalways be harnessed to implement the optimal measurement for any given source.\nSimultaneously, we also outline general conditions under which linear optics\nand photodetection is enough to implement the optimal measurement.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-07T14:15:36Z"}

In contrast, offline transaction systems aim\nto enable users to agree on and execute transactions without assuming bounded\ncommunication delays when interacting with the blockchain. Most existing\noffline payment schemes depend on trusted hardware wallets that are assumed to\nbe secure and tamper-proof. While this work introduces Overdraft, a novel\noffline payment system that shifts the reliance from hardware to users\nthemselves. Overdraft allows potential payment receivers to assess the\nlikelihood of being paid, allowing them to accept transactions with confidence\nor deny them. Overdraft achieves this by maintaining a loan network that is\nweighted by online reputation. This loan network contains time-limited\nagreements where users pledge to cover another user's payment if necessary. For\nexample, when a payer lacks sufficient funds at the moment of commitment.\nOffline users rely on the last known view of the loan network -- which they had\naccess to when last online -- to determine whether to participate in an offline\ntransaction. This view is used to estimate the probability of eventual payment,\npossibly using multiple loans. Once online again, users commit their\ntransactions to the blockchain with any conflicts being resolved\ndeterministically. Overdraft incorporates incentives for users and is designed\nto be resilient against Sybil attacks. As a proof of concept, we implemented\nOverdraft as an Ethereum Solidity smart contract and deployed it on the Sepolia\ntestnet to evaluate its performance.","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR","published":"2025-04-07T14:48:19Z"}

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are\nappealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style\ngenerative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on\nmodeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward.\nInspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e.,\nthe query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs'\ngenerative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents\nwith QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield\na better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever.

AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to\nprevious tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of\ntokens in the input documents during prediction.

One effective approach to addressing this issue is to use an\nefficient feature selection method, which reduces overall resource demands by\nminimizing communication and computation costs, thereby mitigating the impact\nof struggling nodes. Existing federated feature selection (FFS) methods are\neither considered as a separate step from FL or rely on a third party.

The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness.

As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling\nthese systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level\nObjectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical.\nHowever, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput,\nprimarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO\nattainment.

We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by\nthe near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5\nms in the dark.

To\naddress these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a new unified\ntraining-free system leveraging a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as an\nAI agent for emotional and human-like audiobook generation and evaluation.\nSpecifically, we first design a flow-based emotion-enhanced framework that\ndecomposes complex emotional speech synthesis into controllable sub-tasks.\nThen, we propose an adaptive model selection module that dynamically selects\nthe most suitable TTS methods from a set of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nTTS methods for diverse scenarios. We further enhance emotional expressiveness\nthrough paralinguistic augmentation and prosody retrieval at word and utterance\nlevels. For evaluation, we propose a novel GPT-based evaluation framework\nincorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo\nprompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experiments show\nthat our method generates long speech with superior emotional expression to\nSOTA TTS models in various metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework\ndemonstrates better alignment with human preferences and transferability across\naudio tasks.

Recently, deep learning methods have\nbeen widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has\nthree main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer.\nWhile the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of\nsolution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc,\nleaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an\nunsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed\nPINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to\nfind the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural\nnetworks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each\nlayer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture\nparameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of\nPINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our\napproach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior\nusage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as\nthe associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on\nseveral benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers'\nequations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS\nachieves significantly higher architectural accuracy.

However, this approach significantly\nincreases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate\nand evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path.\nTo address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search\ncapabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful\n(learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search\nmethods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem\nstraightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability\ntends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this\ndegradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning\nrate.

However, to realize the swimming\nperformance of biology, there is a need for soft robotic swimmers with both\ndistributed muscles and kinematic feedback. This study presents the design and\nswimming performance of a soft robotic fish with independently controllable\nmuscles and embedded kinematic sensing distributed along the body. The soft\nswimming robot consists of an interior flexible spine, three axially\ndistributed sets of HASEL artificial muscles, embedded strain gauges, a\nstreamlined silicone body, and off-board electronics. In a fixed configuration,\nthe soft robot generates a maximum thrust of 7.9 mN when excited near its first\nresonant frequency (2 Hz) with synchronized antagonistic actuation of all\nmuscles. When excited near its second resonant frequency (8 Hz), synchronized\nmuscle actuation generates 5.0 mN of thrust. By introducing a sequential phase\noffset into the muscle actuation, the thrust at the second resonant frequency\nincreases to 7.2 mN, a 44% increase from simple antagonistic activation. The\nsequential muscle activation improves the thrust by increasing 1) the tail-beat\nvelocity and 2) traveling wave content in the swimming kinematics by four\ntimes. Further, the second resonant frequency (8 Hz) generates nearly as much\nthrust as the first resonance (2 Hz) while requiring only $\\approx25$% of the\ntail displacement, indicating that higher resonant frequencies have benefits\nfor swimming in confined environments where a smaller kinematic envelope is\nnecessary.

Towards\n  long-context evaluation beyond retrieval and haystacks","summary":"Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular\nneedle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate\nspecific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a\nretrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful\nrecall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended\ncontexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,\nshort-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for\nmultilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes\nbeyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop\ninference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,\nMLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to\narbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large\nlanguage model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource\nlanguages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple\nfacts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual\nsettings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context\nlength. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate\nthis to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem.

The process entails first\nsegmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity\nof eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated\neczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the\nseverity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated\ndata to train which can be hard to obtain.

It plays a crucial role in shaping our identity, making decisions,\nlearning from past experiences, building relationships, and adapting to\nchanges. In the era of large language models (LLMs), memory refers to the\nability of an AI system to retain, recall, and use information from past\ninteractions to improve future responses and interactions.

However, the accuracy of tail-fitted SSS is limited,\nfor example, by mismatches between the attenuation image and the PET emission\ndata or by the presence of activity outside the FOV. These shortcomings can be\naddressed using energy-based scatter estimation (EBSE), as recently proposed by\nEfthimiou et al. and Hamill et al.

The proposed\nimproved EBSE method models the energy probability density function (PDF) of\nboth single and multiple scattered photons, and incorporates a\nposition-dependent energy PDF for unscattered photons.

Recently, software testing\ntechniques based on causal inference have been successfully applied to systems\nthat exhibit such characteristics, including scientific models and autonomous\ndriving systems. One significant limitation is that these are restricted to\ntest properties where all of the variables involved can be observed and where\nthere are no interactions between variables. In practice, this is rarely\nguaranteed; the logging infrastructure may not be available to record all of\nthe necessary runtime variable values, and it can often be the case that an\noutput of the system can be affected by complex interactions between variables.\nTo address this, we leverage two additional concepts from causal inference,\nnamely effect modification and instrumental variable methods. We build these\nconcepts into an existing causal testing tool and conduct an evaluative case\nstudy which uses the concepts to test three system-level requirements of CARLA,\na high-fidelity driving simulator widely used in autonomous vehicle development\nand testing.

However, existing agent frameworks\nstill face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting\ntheir effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning\nmethods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local\nbranches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution\nmechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited\naction space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that\nintroduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a\nhierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into\nhigh-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby\nreducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across\ndiverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark\nwith multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of\ntools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate.\nThese findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more\nadvanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex\nreal-world applications.

In this work, we provide a definitive platform for\nexamining pure rarefaction solitons propagating through a strain-softening\nmechanical lattice, addressing these challenges.

More recently, quenching-based phase control has\nbeen applied to correlated electron systems that exhibit metal--insulator,\nmagnetic or superconducting transitions. Despite the discovery of metastable\nelectronic phases, however, how metastability is achieved through the degrees\nof freedom, which can vary even at low temperatures such as those of an\nelectron, is unclear. Here, we show a thermally quenched metastable phase in\nthe Ising model without conservation of magnetization by Monte Carlo\nsimulations. When multiple types of interactions that stabilize different\nlong-range orders are introduced, the ordering kinetics divergently slow toward\nlow temperatures, meaning that the system will reach a low temperature without\nordering if the cooling rate is high enough. Quantitative analysis of the\ndivergent behavior suggests that the energy barrier for eliminating the local\nstructure of competing orders is the origin of this metastability.

Theoretical computer science has\ndeveloped numerous fine-grained frameworks for analyzing algorithmic\nperformance beyond standard worst-case analysis, such as instance optimality\nand output sensitivity. Haeupler et al. [FOCS '24] consider the notion of\nuniversal optimality, a refined complexity measure that accounts for both the\ngraph topology and the edge weights. For a fixed graph topology, the universal\nrunning time of a weighted graph algorithm is defined as its worst-case running\ntime over all possible edge weightings of G. An algorithm is universally\noptimal if no other algorithm achieves a better asymptotic universal running\ntime on any particular graph topology.

An adaptive adversary may\nperform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges\nbetween the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by\nadapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate\nmaximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the\nalgorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for\nupdating the solution upon an adversarial change.

Despite\nnotable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large\nlanguage models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately\ncapture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular,\nthe state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual\nfeatures, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to\npreserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image\ngeneration framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation\nComposition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic\nintentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form\nuser-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs.\nSpecifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement\nlearning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style\nand semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with\ndifficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which\napplies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled\nrepresentations for robust personalized generation.

Different from existing works that mostly considered physical\nlayer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this\npaper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located\nin the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located\nin the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance,\nreferred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we\nformulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs\nby optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the\ntotal BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a\none-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the\nBob in closed form.

Despite\nthe remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear\nwhat representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for\nvarious downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning\nis critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is\nproducing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is\nimperative for further progress.\n  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite\ndifferently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for\nanalyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also\nshow that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is\nneither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture\ntheory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing\nreturns, and further advancements require better contexts.\n  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,\nincluding supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models,\netc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning\nthe contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an\neffortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove\nstatistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss\nthe effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream\ntask.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-28T13:36:28Z"}

A\ngraph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains\na set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$\ninduces a perfect graph.

Such a utilitarian perspective and focus\non the probability models' first moments, however, is agnostic to the\ndistributions' tail behavior and their implications for variability and risks\nin decision-making. This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting\nfrom expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed\na preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different\nreward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that\nincorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward\nuncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric\nperspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly\ndifferent principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal\nsampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in\nthe PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of\narms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs\nfrom the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways,\nprimarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities.

Native speakers of Japanese regulate the\nlinear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the\npredicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the\nthreshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the\nvalency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and\nHD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is\ngreater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability\ndistributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-04-30T08:27:33Z"}

Fortunately, recent GPT-4o\nimage generation of OpenAI has achieved impressive cross-modality generation,\nediting, and design capabilities, which motivates us to answer the above\nquestion by exploring its potential in image compression fields. In this work,\nwe investigate two typical compression paradigms: textual coding and multimodal\ncoding (i.e., text + extremely low-resolution image), where all/most\npixel-level information is generated instead of compressing via the advanced\nGPT-4o image generation function. The essential challenge lies in how to\nmaintain semantic and structure consistency during the decoding process. To\novercome this, we propose a structure raster-scan prompt engineering mechanism\nto transform the image into textual space, which is compressed as the condition\nof GPT-4o image generation. Extensive experiments have shown that the\ncombination of our designed structural raster-scan prompts and GPT-4o's image\ngeneration function achieved the impressive performance compared with recent\nmultimodal/generative image compression at ultra-low bitrate, further\nindicating the potential of AIGC generation in image compression fields.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-30T17:20:14Z"}

This work proposes Spotlight, a low-overhead\nand unobtrusive system for protecting live speech videos from visual\nfalsification of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike predominant\nfalsification detection methods operating in the digital domain, Spotlight\ncreates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all\nvideo recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures\nencode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including\nthe speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to\nprevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and\nvalidated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity.

Evidences include the\nobservation of a reflectivity edge that resembles that of the superconducting\nstate, and the second harmonic generation of a probe optical pulse that is\nmodulated at a frequency similar the reflectivity feature. Since the lower\nJosephson plasmon mode is often associated with coherent oscillations between\nbilayers in the YBCO structure, these experiments have led to the suggestion\nthat the intense pump has created pair coherence up to 350K. In this paper, we\npropose an alternative explanation of these experiments based on the model of\nshort ranged superconducting correlations in the equilibrium state and using\nthe Floquet perspective to analyze optical responses of the photoexcited state.\nOur model only requires local pairing with phase correlations that can be very\nshort ranged when the system is at equilibrium at a temperature above Tc but\nbelow the pseudo-gap temperature T*. Within this assumption there is no phase\ncoherence between bilayers. On the other hand the relative phase between\nmembers of the bilayer has a longer in-plane correlation which leads locally to\na finite Josephson current. We show that the nonlinearity afforded by the local\nintra-bilayer Josephson current is sufficient to explain both the reflectivity\nand second harmonic generation data. The key point is that in the lower\nJosephson plasmon, the coupling between bilayers is mainly capacitive: the\nJosepson current between bilayers can be set to zero without affecting the\nparametric amplification process. The implication is that while superconducting\ncoherence may not be created by the pump, the pseudogap phase must possess a\nlocal pairing amplitude at equilibrium.","main_category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el,physics.optics","published":"2025-05-06T09:28:40Z"}

Taking into account relevant theoretical and experimental\nconstraints, we find that scenario A can fully account for both the diphoton\nand $b\\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV within the $1\\sigma$ range. Moreover, the\npeak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at a peak frequency of\n$10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $2 \\times 10^{-12}$ for $v_s = 100$ TeV.

Traditional numerical methods struggle with\nthe exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic\ndomains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with\ndimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate\nthat overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high\ndimensions.

To address the user-specific uplink\npilot overhead in multiuser NF CSI acquisition, we propose a scheme that uses a\nfixed, UE-independent set of downlink pilots transmitted from a carefully\nselected subset of BS antennas. In dominant LoS conditions, as few as four\npilots suffice, with Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) analysis confirming that\nincreased antenna spacing improves estimation accuracy. Each UE estimates and\nquantizes its angular parameters and feeds them back to the BS for\ngeometry-based CSI reconstruction, eliminating the need for full channel\nfeedback. To enhance robustness against noise, quantization errors, and\nnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) components, we introduce a two-stage precoding method.\nThe initial precoding is computed from estimated LoS CSI and refined through\nbidirectional over-the-air (OTA) training. Furthermore, a two-step stream\nallocation strategy reduces pilot and computational overhead. Simulations\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high data rates with\nsignificantly fewer OTA iterations, approaching the performance of perfect CSI.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-05-07T10:24:13Z"}

It has been beneficial for\nresearch on clone detection and has become a standard in evaluating the\nperformance of clone detection tools. More recently, it has also been widely\nused as a dataset to evaluate machine learning approaches to semantic clone\ndetection or code similarity detection for functional or semantic similarity.\n  This paper demonstrates that BigCloneBench is problematic to use as ground\ntruth for learning or evaluating semantic code similarity, and highlights the\naspects of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality. A manual\ninvestigation of a statistically significant random sample of 406 Weak\nType-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed that 93% of them do not have a similar\nfunctionality and are therefore mislabelled. In a literature review of 179\npapers that use BigCloneBench as a dataset, we found 139 papers that used\nBigCloneBench to evaluate semantic clone detection and where the results are\nthreatened in their validity by the mislabelling. As such, these papers often\nreport high F1 scores (e.g., above 0.9), which indicates overfitting to\ndataset-specific artefacts rather than genuine semantic similarity detection.\n  We emphasise that using BigCloneBench remains valid for the intended purpose\nof evaluating syntactic or textual clone detection of Type-1, Type-2, and\nType-3 clones. We acknowledge the important contributions of BigCloneBench to\ntwo decades of traditional clone detection research. However, the usage of\nBigCloneBench beyond the intended purpose without careful consideration of its\nlimitations has led to misleading results and conclusions, and potentially\nharmed the field of semantic clone detection.","main_category":"cs.SE","categories":"cs.SE","published":"2025-05-07T10:52:28Z"}

Our\nevaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real\nbronchoscopy procedures data.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis\nseverity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten\ndiagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations\nand less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is\nrequired. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic\nstenosis severity assessment.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-08T11:13:38Z"}

However, its separate design often lacks\nsystematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper\nproposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations\n(LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective,\nLAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between\ntemporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control,\nwhile unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations\nat both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated\nalgorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and\nobjective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of\ndifferent sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python\npackage-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system\noptimization models with learnable components.

This binary\nencoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often\nresulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract\nDNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs,\nproviding a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN.\nCrucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output\nreachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during\nthe FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less\ncomputational effort than the traditional binary verification approach.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial\ninputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more\ndetailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions\ninclude a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel\nabstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract\ninterpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel\nproblem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep\nreinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard\nDNN-Verification benchmarks.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI","published":"2025-05-08T13:29:46Z"}

Meanwhile, advances in\nconnected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based\ntraffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have\ninvestigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV\nenvironments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research\ngaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time\nCV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both\nthe spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing\napproaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays.

Unlike humans, who often favor\na dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute\nambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce\nSYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for\nambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral\nsymmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation\ntasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By\nexploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from\none arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the\nsubtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the\nhand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated\nmanipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of\nthem. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the\nleft and right hands perform different roles.
