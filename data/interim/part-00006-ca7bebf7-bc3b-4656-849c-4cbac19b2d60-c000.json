Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\nhas emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and\nbroader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which\nis computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However,\nsingle-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due\nto the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the\ntest-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of\nagent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned\nLLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture\nof agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for\ninference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among\nmultiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen\nfrom a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This\npolicy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step,\nenabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding.\nTheoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance\nwith respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given\noff-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with\nopen-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates\nthe merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines.

In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify\nthe underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped\n$L$PO$_{4}$ series.

Here we present\nstatistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold\ngas outflows in quasars at $z \\sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\\mu$m\nemission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral\ngas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to\nsub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars.

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in a\nvariety of plasma technologies, including Hall thrusters, where azimuthal\ninstabilities significantly influence electron confinement and, hence, device\nperformance. While the impact of prominent plasma instabilities, such as the\nelectron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream\ninstability (MTSI) on cross-field transport of electron species is well\nrecognized and widely studied, strategies for actively manipulating these\ndynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the effect of\ntargeted wave excitation on instability evolution and electron transport using\none- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of representative plasma\ndischarge configurations. A time-varying electric field is applied axially to\nmodulate the spectral energy distribution of the instabilities across a range\nof forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Our results reveal that the so-called\n\"unsteady forcing\" can both suppress and amplify instability modes depending on\nexcitation parameters. In particular, across both 1D and 2D simulation\nconfigurations, forcing near 40 MHz effectively reduces ECDI amplitude and\ndecreases axial electron transport by about 30%, while high-frequency\nexcitation near the electron cyclotron frequency induces spectral broadening,\ninverse energy cascades, and enhanced transport. These findings point to the\nrole of nonlinear frequency locking and energy pathway disruption as mechanisms\nfor modifying instability-driven transport. Our results offer insights into\npotential pathways to enhance plasma confinement and control in next-generation\nExB devices.","main_category":"physics.plasm-ph","categories":"physics.plasm-ph","published":"2025-04-03T16:36:08Z"}

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the\nuse of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering\nfunctionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss\ncoefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900v1","title":"Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline\n  states in open systems","summary":"In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against\nthermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of\nthe period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and\ndiscrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity\nsystem, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for\nprecise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred\nintermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We\ndemonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the\ndriving frequency.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,cond-mat.quant-gas,nlin.PS","published":"2025-04-07T10:19:55Z"}

Moreover, the support of vector $\\xi$ is a collection of $N$\nscenarios in dimension $p=2$ or $p=3$. In general, even when both the\nconstraint and the objective are convex in the decision variable, the feasible\nregion of a CCP is nonconvex, turning it into a difficult problem. However,\nunder mild assumptions, many CCPs can be recast as big-$M$ mixed-integer convex\nprograms (MICP). Unfortunately, the difficulty of these MICPs explodes with the\nnumber of scenarios, restricting the instances practically solvable in decent\ntime. To cut down the effective number of scenarios considered in MICP\nreformulations and accelerate their solving, we propose and test presolve\ntechniques based on computational geometry. Our techniques produce certificates\nto discard or select a priori some scenarios before solving a regular MICP.\nMoreover, the information aggregated during presolve leverages the possibility\nto strengthen big-$M$ constants. Our numerical experiments suggest that\nspending some time in presolve is more efficient than a direct solve for a\nclass of probabilistic projection problems, including an interesting type of\nfacility location problem.","main_category":"math.OC","categories":"math.OC","published":"2025-04-08T08:11:38Z"}

Cataloging viruses across\nvarious environments is essential for understanding their properties and\nfunctions. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as the most comprehensive method\nfor virus discovery, enabling the sequencing of all genetic materials,\nincluding viruses, from host or environmental samples. However, distinguishing\nviral sequences from the vast background of cellular organism-derived reads in\nmetagenomic data remains a significant challenge. While several learning-based\ntools, such as VirSorter2 and geNomad, have shown promise in identifying viral\ncontigs, they often experience varying degrees of false positive rates due to\nnoise in sequencing and assembly, shared genes between viruses and their hosts,\nand the formation of proviruses within host genomes.

Results: To address these challenges, we introduce ViralQC, a tool\ndesigned to assess the quality of reported viral contigs or bins. ViralQC\nidentifies contamination regions within putative viral sequences using\nfoundation models trained on viral and cellular genomes and estimates viral\ncompleteness through protein organization alignment. We evaluate ViralQC on\nmultiple datasets and compare its performance against CheckV, the\nstate-of-the-art in virus quality assessment. Notably, ViralQC correctly\nidentifies 38% more contamination than CheckV, while maintaining a median\nabsolute error of only 3%. In addition, ViralQC delivers more accurate results\nfor medium- to high-quality (>50% completeness) contigs, demonstrating its\nsuperior performance in completeness estimation.","main_category":"q-bio.GN","categories":"q-bio.GN","published":"2025-04-08T08:14:44Z"}

This paper\nexplores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design\nlevers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to\nstudy chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these\nexperiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in\nchatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently\nthan expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this\nunderutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a\nprocess with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a\nsecond, expert service stage -- a behavior we term \"gatekeeper aversion\".

Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce\nthis overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We\npresent a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for\npredicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nmodel that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on\nGraph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast\nto previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries,\nour dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle\ngeometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form\nmodifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our\nresults show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3\ndrag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8.

While both methods effectively capture the broader\ntrends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline\ngeometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer\nintra-baseline group variations.

However, previous works have primarily focused on\ntwo-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather\nthan pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative\ninvestments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear\npublic goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the\ncooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating\nbenefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit\nfunction, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the\nthreshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For\nintermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies\ncan coexist. When the threshold value is large, a unique repellor displays.\nFinally, we perform individual-based simulations to validate our theoretical\nresults.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph","published":"2025-04-09T10:47:05Z"}

Current QML research remains primarily\ntheoretical, often assuming noise-free environments and offering little insight\ninto the integration of QEC with QML implementations. To address this, we\ninvestigate the performance of a simple, parity-classifying Variational Quantum\nClassifier (VQC) implemented with the [[4,2,2]] error-detecting stabiliser code\nin a simulated noisy environment, marking the first study into the\nimplementation of a QML algorithm with a QEC code.

Going beyond final accuracy,\nwe propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output\nfrom language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks:\nunderstanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow\nfrom them. The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with\nthe goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs\nunderstand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can\nthey infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? Since existing benchmarks\nmay be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency\non novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. On novel grade school math\nproblems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of\ninput premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of\nreasoning hops is increased. Interestingly, these errors are masked in the\noriginal benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy. As we increase the\nnumber of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple\nhops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input\npremises. Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural\npropagation of early errors do not explain the trends. Our analysis provides a\nnew view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input\npremises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across\nproblem domains.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T17:53:55Z"}

They are appealing for developing fast\nreference libraries without double rounding issues. The key insight is to build\npolynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with\ntwo additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with\nthe \"non-standard\" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the\nRLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The\nresulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with\nmachine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding\nmode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest\nmode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the\nsystem's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded\nresult, and restores the application's rounding mode. This frequent change of\nrounding modes has a performance cost.\n  This paper proposes two new methods, which we call rounding-invariant outputs\nand rounding-invariant input bounds, to avoid the frequent changes to the\nrounding mode and the dependence on the round-to-nearest mode.

We investigate the physical implications of\nthis phenomenon. In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two\nelectromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of\nthe two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when\nlinear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the\ntotal polarization degree conserved. However, incoherent superposition can lead\nto depolarization. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent\nsuperposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be\ncomparable when jumps occur, placing constraints on the intrinsic radiation\nmechanisms. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation\nmechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps\nby generating two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a\ngeometric effect due to sweeping line-of-sight is a more plausible reason. This\nrequires the emission region to be within the magnetosphere of a spinning\ncentral engine, likely a magnetar.

This chapter studies the risk of\nautomation in developing country labor markets, with a particular focus on\ndifferences between men and women. Given the pervasiveness of gender\noccupational segregation, there may be important gender differences in the risk\nof automation. Understanding these differences is important to ensure progress\ntowards equitable development and gender inclusion in the face of new\ntechnological advances. Our objective is to describe the gender gap in the\nroutine task intensity of jobs in developing countries and to explore the role\nof occupational segregation and several worker characteristics in accounting\nfor the gender gap.","main_category":"econ.GN","categories":"econ.GN,q-fin.EC","published":"2025-04-10T12:19:25Z"}

Recent advances in\ngenerative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development\nof uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative\nmodel-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on\nthe underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the\nposterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian\nneural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic)\nuncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction\nmethod by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters.\nUnfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly\nquantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still\npersists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an\nexisting generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and\nintroduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian\nneural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by\nleveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be\neasily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated\nthe proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and\nimage inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric\nuncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the\ncharacteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.\nFurthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on\ntop of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent\nwith frequentist principles.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T12:30:46Z"}

As a proof-of-concept we use parton densities\nobtained with the Parton Branching (PB) approach, and modify the default\ninitial-state shower in PYTHIA8 with this method to be consistent with them. PB\nis ideally suited for checking the validity of our method since, in addition to\nproducing collinear parton densities, it also produces the corresponding\ntransverse-dependent (TMD) ones, and these can then be directly compared to the\ntransverse momentum distribution obtained from the parton shower. We show that\nTMD distributions which we in this way obtain from our modified PYTHIA8 shower\nusing leading order (LO) parton densities and splitting functions are fully\nconsistent with the corresponding leading order TMD densities. At\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) it is not possible to achieve the same consistency\nusing the built-in LO splitting functions in the shower, but we show that by\nintroducing NLO splitting functions using a reweighting procedure, we can\nachieve consistency also at NLO. The method presented here, which we have named\nPDF2ISR, can be easily extended to any collinear parton densities, as long as\nthe exact conditions for the evolution are known.

Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational\ncomplexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift\ntowards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing\nEuclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle\ninequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To\naddress this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating\nnon-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory\nrepresentation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic\nspace to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in\nEuclidean embeddings.

Using a self-consistent coupling of the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we\ndemonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading\nto a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the\ntunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust,\nwhile the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and\nreducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well\nsignificantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak\nvalue of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the\nresistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V. Additionally, the device\nexhibits negative differential resistance, further enhancing its functionality.\nOur results confirm that this design enables scalable, energy-efficient, and\nhigh-performance non-volatile memory, making it a strong candidate for future\nmemory technologies.","main_category":"cond-mat.mes-hall","categories":"cond-mat.mes-hall","published":"2025-04-15T12:39:54Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11140v1","title":"An Unsupervised Network Architecture Search Method for Solving Partial\n  Differential Equations","summary":"Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has been indispensable in\nscientific and engineering applications. Recently, deep learning methods have\nbeen widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has\nthree main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer.\nWhile the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of\nsolution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc,\nleaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an\nunsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed\nPINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to\nfind the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural\nnetworks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each\nlayer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture\nparameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of\nPINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our\napproach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior\nusage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as\nthe associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on\nseveral benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers'\nequations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS\nachieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting\nobservation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a\nprominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that\narchitectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior\nperformance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.","main_category":"math.NA","categories":"math.NA,cs.NA","published":"2025-04-15T12:42:32Z"}

These methods\noften encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of\nphotorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines\ngeometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for\ntransparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on\ngeometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.\nIn the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular\nmodeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric\naccuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth\nextraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending\nweights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust\nweighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task\nunder realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex\ntransparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that\nTSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of\ntransparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.\nSpecifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a\n37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score\ncompared to the top baseline.

Introducing parallel compliance in\nquadrupedal design is deemed to enhance locomotion performance, which, however,\nmakes the control task even harder. This work aims to address this challenge by\nproposing a general template model and establishing an efficient motion\nplanning and control pipeline. To start, we propose a reduced-order template\nmodel-the dual-legged actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum with trunk\nrotation-which explicitly models parallel compliance by decoupling spring\neffects from active motor actuation. With this template model, versatile\nacrobatic motions, such as pronking, froggy jumping, and hop-turn, are\ngenerated by a dual-layer trajectory optimization, where the singularity-free\nbody rotation representation is taken into consideration. Integrated with a\nlinear singularity-free tracking controller, enhanced quadrupedal locomotion is\nachieved. Comparisons with the existing template model reveal the improved\naccuracy and generalization of our model. Hardware experiments with a rigid\nquadruped and a newly designed compliant quadruped demonstrate that i) the\ntemplate model enables generating versatile dynamic motion; ii) parallel\nelasticity enhances explosive motion. For example, the maximal pronking\ndistance, hop-turn yaw angle, and froggy jumping distance increase at least by\n25%, 15% and 25%, respectively; iii) parallel elasticity improves the\nrobustness against dynamic uncertainties, including modelling errors and\nexternal disturbances. For example, the allowable support surface height\nvariation increases by 100% for robust froggy jumping.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO","published":"2025-04-17T11:20:29Z"}

However,\nexisting approaches often overlook the quality variations in local features and\nfail to fully leverage the complementary information across modalities,\nparticularly in the case of low-quality features. In this paper, we propose to\naddress this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the\nModality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first\nconstruct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between\npatches.

Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes\noffer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and\ndecoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD)\ncirculant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient\nfinite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the\navailable degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD\nrelocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC\nor MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of\nshort cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution\nwhere the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous\niteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the\ninvariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible\npartitioning or lifting arrangement.

We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to\nthe actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of\niterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the\nsize of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code\ndesign techniques based on gradient-descent.

Although\nrecent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their\ncapabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and\ndeformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the\nlack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under\ndiverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for\ngenerating appropriate grasp motions.

This hardware configuration enables real-time slip\ndetection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips.\nFurthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis\npipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions.

Creating a large training dataset encompassing\nall relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the\ncomputational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor.\nCommonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain.\nHere, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast\nprobabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts\nback to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not\nrequired to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a\nsignificant reduction in the data collection time.

By\ncontrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large\n$\\phi_{\\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\\phi_{\\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$\nin the zero-$\\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\\phi_{\\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at\n$\\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for\n$\\phi_{\\max}$ as functions of $\\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our\nsoft-core SHU packings for small $\\chi$ become configurationally very close to\nthe jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as\nmeasured by the pair statistics. As $\\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the\npackings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting\nstructure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that\nsoft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range\ncorrelations in the SHU ground states.

The main performance metric in this setting is the\nalgorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for\nupdating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of\nsingle-edge insertions and deletions, we obtain the following results:\n  We give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O(\n\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\beta k} )$ rounds that maintains a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate\nmaximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges of the\ngraph.

Particularly in\nthe nondeterministic setting, the $\\forall\\exists$ relational Hoare logic is\nrequired. Existing approaches encode this logic into a Hoare logic with ghost\nstates and invariants, yet these extensions significantly increase\nformalization complexity and soundness proof overhead.

Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they\nonly provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale\nstatistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive\npatterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an\ninterpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption\ncharacterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent\ndiagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build\nupon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1)\ncontinuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to\nseparate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive\nregimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption\nrate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data.\nThe proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV\ndischarges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We\nevaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its\ncorrelation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish\ndifferent types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we\nconduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to\ndisruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can\nadequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying\nproximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.","main_category":"physics.plasm-ph","categories":"physics.plasm-ph,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-24T16:14:16Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17723v1","title":"Towards Robust LLMs: an Adversarial Robustness Measurement Framework","summary":"The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial\nintelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations,\nundermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial\nrobustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM\nrobustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and\nAssessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial\ninputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's\nestimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy\nwith minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our\nempirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only\nbetween different models but also across categories within the same task and\nbetween various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the\nneed for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to\ncompare and select models based on application-specific robustness\nrequirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM\nrobustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for\nreal-world deployment.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-24T16:36:19Z"}

However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often\nresource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and\ncomputational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing\narchitectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture\nfor wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep\nlearning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations:\ndisaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation\nof general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio\nfrequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast\nmodel weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image\nclassification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per\nclient, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This\napproach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly\nconnected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement\nin efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.ET,eess.SP,physics.app-ph","published":"2025-04-24T17:10:18Z"}
