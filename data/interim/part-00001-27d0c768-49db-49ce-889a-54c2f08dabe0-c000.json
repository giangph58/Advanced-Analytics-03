However, these smart\ncontracts are vulnerable to exploitable bugs that can lead to substantial\nmonetary losses. A recent study reveals that over 80% of these exploitable\nbugs, which are primarily functional bugs, can evade the detection of current\ntools. The primary issue is the significant gap between understanding the\nhigh-level logic of the business model and checking the low-level\nimplementations in smart contracts. Furthermore, identifying deeply rooted\nfunctional bugs in smart contracts requires the automated generation of\neffective detection oracles based on various bug features. To address these\nchallenges, we design and implement PROMFUZZ, an automated and scalable system\nto detect functional bugs, in smart contracts. In PROMFUZZ, we first propose a\nnovel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven analysis framework, which leverages a\ndual-agent prompt engineering strategy to pinpoint potentially vulnerable\nfunctions for further scrutiny. We then implement a dual-stage coupling\napproach, which focuses on generating invariant checkers that leverage logic\ninformation extracted from potentially vulnerable functions. Finally, we design\na bug-oriented fuzzing engine, which maps the logical information from the\nhigh-level business model to the low-level smart contract implementations, and\nperforms the bug-oriented fuzzing on targeted functions. We compare PROMFUZZ\nwith multiple state-of-the-art methods. The results show that PROMFUZZ achieves\n86.96% recall and 93.02% F1-score in detecting functional bugs, marking at\nleast a 50% improvement in both metrics over state-of-the-art methods.\nMoreover, we perform an in-depth analysis on real-world DeFi projects and\ndetect 30 zero-day bugs.

However, novelty is also a crucial\ndeterminant of the unique perception of relevance and quality of an experience,\nas it rests upon each individual's understanding of the world. Social factors,\nparticularly cultural background, profoundly influence perceptions of novelty\nand innovation. Cultural novelty arises from differences in salience and\nnovelty as shaped by the distance between distinct communities. While cultural\ndiversity has garnered increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI),\nthe lack of robust metrics for quantifying cultural novelty hinders a deeper\nunderstanding of these divergences.

This enhancement arises\nfrom the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional\nplane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion\ndriven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous\nmeridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings. The resulting\nsize-dependent dust distribution has a strong spatial variation, with large\ngrains preferentially accumulating in dense rings, particularly in the inner\ndisk, while being depleted in low-density gas gaps.

To fill this gap, we\npropose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core\ndimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and\nhow well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review\nof methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an\norganized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of\nindividual techniques within the broader TTS landscape.

Furthermore, most of variants overlook crucial\ninformation, such as commit messages and patch context, and are limited to\nbug-fixing commits involving deleted lines.

Equivalence\nchecking is a fundamental correctness question -- needed, e.g., for ensuring\nthat transformations applied to a quantum circuit do not alter its behavior.\nFor quantum circuits, the problem is challenging because a straightforward\nrepresentation on a classical computer of each circuit's quantum state can\nrequire time and space that are exponential in the number of qubits $n$.\n  The paper presents decision procedures for two variants of the\nequivalence-checking problem. Both can be carried out on a classical computer\nin time and space that, for any fixed depth, is linear in $n$. Our critical\ninsight is that local projections are precise enough to completely characterize\nthe output state of a shallow quantum circuit. Instead of explicitly computing\nthe output state of a circuit, we generate a set of local projections that\nserve as constraints on the output state. Moreover, the circuit's output state\nis the unique quantum state that satisfies all the constraints.\n  Beyond equivalence checking, we show how to use the constraint representation\nto check a class of assertions, both statically and at run time.

At present, we have no objective method of deciding whether the\nparameters of the observed meteoroid stream represent a further solution to an\nalready known object or whether they relate to a new discovery. As result, the\nMeteor Data Center (MDC) database of the International Astronomical Union (IAU)\ncontains duplicates and false duplicates of the meteor showers.\n  It is desirable to detect questionable cases and, if possible, correct their\nstatus, thereby contributing to the improvement of the content of the IAU MDC\ndatabase. The correct content of the MDC database is important in its\napplications, for example, in assessing the threat from meteoroids to Earth's\nartificial satellites.\n  Two approaches were used, in the first the internal compatibility of\ngeocentric and heliocentric parameters representing a given flux was verified.\nIn the second, a comparison of two or more solutions of the same stream was\nmade in as much detail as possible. Fifty-six streams were verified, for which\nclear suspicion of misclassification was established in our earlier work.\n  For 43 streams, the misclassification was confirmed, with a proposal to\nchange their status in the MDC to autonomous. In the remaining 13 cases, it was\nproposed to leave their status unchanged.\n  Although we do not consider it 'definitive', our study clearly shows that\nrepeated misclassification of new meteoroid flux solutions has occurred in the\npast. Correction of these cases will significantly improve the content of the\nMDC database. As an additional product, based on the approach proposed in this\nand our earlier work, relevant procedures have been proposed, which, available\non the MDC database website, will make it possible to compare new meteoroid\ndata with the contents of the database, thereby avoiding errors in their\nclassification.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM","published":"2025-04-03T08:37:52Z"}

As such, their mining has been studied on various data types, including\nitemsets, graphs, and strings. The complexity of mining maximal frequent\nitemsets and subtrees has been thoroughly investigated (e.g., [Boros et al.,\n2003], [Uno et al., 2004]) in the literature.

This research presents a hybrid model combining Graph\nAttention Networks (GATs) and Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) for leaf\ndisease classification. GCNs have been widely used for learning from\ngraph-structured data, and GATs enhance this by incorporating attention\nmechanisms to focus on the most important neighbors.

The edge augmentation technique has introduced a\nsignificant degree of generalization in the detection capabilities of the\nmodel. To further optimize training, weight initialization techniques are\napplied. The hybrid model is evaluated against the individual performance of\nthe GCN and GAT models and the hybrid model achieved a precision of 0.9822,\nrecall of 0.9818, and F1-score of 0.9818 in apple leaf disease classification,\na precision of 0.9746, recall of 0.9744, and F1-score of 0.9743 in potato leaf\ndisease classification, and a precision of 0.8801, recall of 0.8801, and\nF1-score of 0.8799 in sugarcane leaf disease classification.

The\napplications in nuclear environments require radiation resistance. The\ncharacteristics of Ge-doped MM fibers are investigated for Radiation Induced\nAttenuation (RIA) in Total Ionizing Dose (TID).\n  Methods: Commercial samples of Ge-doped MM fibers were irradiated in Go-60\ngamma rays at dose rates of 5 to 1.4k Gy(SiO2)/hr. The fiber samples were\npackaged in water tanks maintained at constant temperatures in the range of -15\nto 45 degC. The optical power transmitted through the fibers were recorded in\nirradiation, and in annealing when the source was shielded. The measurements of\nRIA in time are analyzed for dose rate and temperature dependences.\n  Results: Ge-doped fiber samples of OM2 to OM4 grades were investigated for\nattenuation of optical power in radiation ionizing dose. Depending on the\nfabrication technology, two of the fiber types show radiation resistance with\nthe RIAs of 0.2 dB/m and 0.05 dB/m, respectively, for the TID of 300 kGy(SiO2).\nAt low dose rate of 5 Gy/hr, the RIA increases steadily and the annealing of\nlow density ionizing defects does not cause notable deviation.

In the testing phase, they\nidentify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To\nlearn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and\ntrain a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to\nreconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution.\nDeviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which\nindicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably\ncauses information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal\nreconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we\npropose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D\nbrain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and\nreconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This\nprocess iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information\nfurther guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be\nreconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve\nbetter reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image\ncontent as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the\nmasked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and\nreal-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological\nlesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-07T10:41:23Z"}

For a single\nsource case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time\ninstant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process,\nand prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this\nthreshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and\ntime varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the\npopular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This\nalgorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total\nvariation of each of these quantities over a time horizon.

This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe,\nwhere the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its\nevolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the\nexploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may\ncontribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the\ninteraction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be\ninvestigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within\naround $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely\nunexplored for these objects.\n  Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC)\nanalysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the\nunusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction\nscenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this\nwith a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the\nsurrounding circumstellar medium.

Here, we integrate space-based\nsolar power (SBSP) -- a potential near-constant, orbital solar technology --\ninto a high-resolution, Europe-wide capacity-expansion and dispatch model to\nquantify its contribution under net-zero constraints. We examine two advanced\nSBSP designs: (1) a near-baseload, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) concept\n(heliostat-based Representative Design RD1) and (2) a partially intermittent,\nhigher-TRL concept (planar-based RD2), both drawing on NASA's 2050 cost and\nperformance projections. Our results show that RD1 can reduce total system\ncosts by 7--15%, displace up to 80% of intermittent wind and solar, and cut\nbattery usage by over 70%, if it meets its forecast cost reductions -- though\nlong-duration storage (e.g., hydrogen) remains essential for seasonal\nbalancing. By contrast, RD2 is economically unattractive at its projected 2050\ncosts. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, we identify cost thresholds at\nwhich SBSP shifts from cost-prohibitive to complementary and ultimately to a\ndominant baseload technology. Specifically, RD1 becomes complementary at\nroughly 14x and dominant at 9x the 2050 solar PV capital cost, benefiting from\nits continuous power generation. Meanwhile, RD2 must achieve even lower cost\nlevels (9x to be complementary and 6x to dominate) and would rely on\nshort-duration storage to mitigate its partial intermittency.

It offers a valuable measure for monitoring and interpreting trends\nin disease outcomes. When information on the cause of death is unavailable or\nunreliable, the Relative Survival (RS) framework is the preferred approach for\nestimating Net Survival, which represents survival in a hypothetical scenario\nwhere the disease of interest is the only possible cause of death. In the\ncontext of cancer, RS often reaches a plateau, indicating that a portion of\ndiagnosed patients is cured, as they have the same risk of dying as a\ncomparable group of healthy individuals with similar demographic\ncharacteristics. Classical RS cure models use logistic regression to estimate\nthe fraction of cured patients. However, this functional form is somewhat\narbitrary, and misspecifying it can severely distort the resulting cure\nindicators. Consequently, evaluations of the efficacy of cancer treatments at\nthe population level could be inaccurate, leading to biased decision-making\nregarding patient care.

To reduce this cost and\nleverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments,\nwe aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace\nhuman annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes\nrelevance, which indicates \"topic-relatedness\" of a document to a query, while\nin RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to\nanswer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM\nperformance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach\nrequires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited\ngeneralization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful\ndocuments as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not\ntask-specific.

For future quantum network applications, matter-based entanglement is\nmore favorable since the capability of storage is essential for advanced\napplications. Extending entanglement distance for memory qubits was partially\nhindered by the mismatch of its photonic emission wavelength with the low-loss\ntransmission window of optical fiber. By incorporating quantum frequency\nconversion, memory-memory entanglement has been successfully extended to\nseveral tens of kilometers. Here, we make a significant step further by\nreporting the entanglement between two atomic ensemble quantum memories over\n420 km. We convert photons emitted from the memories to telecom S-band, which\nenable us to exploit the significantly low transmission loss in fiber (0.17\ndB/km).

The model is organized in a\nhierarchical architecture combining feature extraction and continuous-time\nconvolution, with each individual stage tailored to the physics of the\nconsidered mass-spring systems. For each step in the computation, a subsystem\nis designed by combining a small set of low-order polynomial potentials. These\npotentials act as fundamental components that interconnect a network of masses.\nIn analogy to electronic circuit design, where complex functional circuits are\nconstructed by combining basic components into hierarchical designs, we refer\nto this framework as springtronics.

However, LAEs face two critical challenges: (i) popularity\nbias, which tends to recommend popular items, and (ii) neighborhood bias, which\noverly focuses on capturing local item correlations. To address these issues,\nthis paper first analyzes the effect of two existing normalization methods for\nLAEs, i.e., random-walk and symmetric normalization. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals that normalization highly affects the degree of popularity and\nneighborhood biases among items. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a\nversatile normalization solution, called Data-Adaptive Normalization (DAN),\nwhich flexibly controls the popularity and neighborhood biases by adjusting\nitem- and user-side normalization to align with unique dataset characteristics.\nOwing to its model-agnostic property, DAN can be easily applied to various\nLAE-based models. Experimental results show that DAN-equipped LAEs consistently\nimprove existing LAE-based models across six benchmark datasets, with\nsignificant gains of up to 128.57% and 12.36% for long-tail items and unbiased\nevaluations, respectively.

One extensively studied example is the\nferromagnetic (FM) CrI$_3$ monolayer with the honeycomb Cr$^{3+}$ ($t_{2g}^3$,\n$S$ = 3/2) spin lattice, while VPS$_3$ has a same honeycomb $S$ = 3/2 spin\nlattice (V$^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^3$) but displays N$\\acute{e}$el antiferromagnetism\n(AFM). In this work, we study the electronic structure and particularly the\ncontrasting magnetism of VPS$_3$ and CrI$_3$ monolayers. We find that VPS$_3$\nis a Mott-Hubbard insulator but CrI$_3$ is a charge-transfer insulator, and\ntherefore their magnetic exchange mechanisms are essentially different. The\nfirst nearest-neighbor (1NN) direct $d$-$d$ exchange dominates in VPS$_3$, thus\nleading to a strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling. However, the formation of\nvanadium vacancies, associated with instability of the low-valence V$^{2+}$\nions, suppresses the AF coupling and thus strongly reduces the N$\\acute{e}$el\ntemperature ($T_{\\text{N}}$) in line with the experimental observation. In\ncontrast, our results reveal that the major 1NN $d$-$p$-$d$ superexchanges in\nCrI$_3$ via different channels give rise to competing FM and AF couplings,\nultimately resulting in a weak FM coupling as observed experimentally. After\nrevisiting several important superexchange channels reported in the literature,\nbased on our MLWFs and tight-binding analyses, we note that some antiphase\ncontributions must be subtly and simultaneously considered, and thus we provide\na deeper insight into the FM coupling of CrI$_3$. Moreover, we identify and\ncompare the major contributions to the magnetic anisotropy, i.e., a weak shape\nanisotropy in VPS$_3$ and a relatively strong exchange anisotropy in CrI$_3$.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-08T12:06:05Z"}

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\nprovide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between\ntime-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on\ndemand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation.\nIn this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic\nKerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with\nelliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and\nconsequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies\nthe nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third\nharmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken\ntime-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and\ncentrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals.

There is some\ndebate as to whether these should even be considered distinct phases. The\nstandard definition of a transition between distinct phases involves a\ndiscontinuity in any derivative of the free energy. This can be hard to prove\nexperimentally, and most previous theoretical works have been based on models\nwhich either have continuously differentiable free energies, or no\nstraightforward way to determine the free energy. Here we build a free energy\nmodel based on the common definitions of the phases ; ordered ice-VIII,\norientationally disordered ice VII and proton-disordered ice X. All transitions\nin this model might or might not be associated with a discontinuity in the\nspecific heat, depending on paramaterization. By comparing with data, we find\nthat a VII-X transition line exists, but it ends in a critical point hidden\nwithin the stability field of phase VIII. If the model is correct, there is a\ndiscontinuity between VII and X, so they are separate phases. We propose that\nthe hidden phase boundary might be demonstrated experimentally by compression\nof supercooled ice VII.","main_category":"cond-mat.stat-mech","categories":"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-08T17:43:42Z"}

The core challenge of this task is how to construct\na generalized feature space for novel categories with limited data on the basis\nof the base category space, which could adapt the learned detection model to\nunknown scenarios. However, limited by insufficient samples for novel\ncategories, two issues still exist: (1) the features of the novel category are\neasily implicitly represented by the features of the base category, leading to\ninseparable classifier boundaries, (2) novel categories with fewer data are not\nenough to fully represent the distribution, where the model fine-tuning is\nprone to overfitting. To address these issues, we introduce the side\ninformation to alleviate the negative influences derived from the feature space\nand sample viewpoints and formulate a novel generalized feature representation\nlearning method for FSOD.

The wavefunctions\nof hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified\nJackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been\nextended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as\ngain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra\ncan be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane,\nwhether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines,\nrespectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be\ncontinuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra.

One of the key\nchallenges of this problem is the user's stochastic watch-time behavior. To\nimprove the prediction accuracy for such an uncertain behavior, existing\napproaches show that one can either reduce the noise through duration bias\nmodeling or formulate a distribution modeling task to capture the uncertainty.\nHowever, the uncontrolled uncertainty is not always equally distributed across\nusers and videos, inducing a balancing paradox between the model accuracy and\nthe ability to capture out-of-distribution samples. In practice, we find that\nthe uncertainty of the watch-time prediction model also provides key\ninformation about user behavior, which, in turn, could benefit the prediction\ntask itself. Following this notion, we derive an explicit uncertainty modeling\nstrategy for the prediction model and propose an adversarial optimization\nframework that can better exploit the user watch-time behavior.

With chance-constrained optimization serving as a natural\nstarting point for modeling this class of problems, our primary contribution is\nto characterize how the optimal costs and decisions scale for a generic joint\nchance-constrained model as the target probability of satisfying the\nservice/reliability constraints approaches its maximal level. Beyond providing\ninsights into the behavior of optimal solutions, our scaling framework has\nthree key algorithmic implications. First, in distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO) modeling of chance constraints, we show that widely used\napproaches based on KL-divergences, Wasserstein distances, and moments heavily\ndistort the scaling properties of optimal decisions, leading to exponentially\nhigher costs. In contrast, incorporating marginal distributions or using\nappropriately chosen f-divergence balls preserves the correct scaling, ensuring\ndecisions remain conservative by at most a constant or logarithmic factor.\nSecond, we leverage the scaling framework to quantify the conservativeness of\ncommon inner approximations and propose a simple line search to refine their\nsolutions, yielding near-optimal decisions.

Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is\ncrucial for language models of different sizes and applications. One of the\nmost widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag;\nhowever, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues.\nThese issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading\nprompts or equally correct options. Furthermore, we show that if models are\nevaluated only on answer texts, or with \"Lorem ipsum dolor...\" instead of the\nquestion, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot\nbe attributed merely to contamination. Since benchmark scores are an essential\npart of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these\nvalidity issues can have severe consequences.

The system performs\nmulti-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video\nstreams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise\nanimal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard\nhardware.

Essentially, computational resource is\nfocused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly\nimprove UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy.\nAlongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated\nanimal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol\nPejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes,\nsegmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point\ntrajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches\nincluding OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments\nwith onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife\ntracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed\nfor future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational\nautonomy.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-14T12:21:16Z"}

The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential\nand requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. In general, the\nfeedback controller has three different steps: measurement, feedback, and\nrelaxation. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential\nenergy that is essential for a nonzero work output. BIE utilises the amount of\ninformation (surprise) acquired during the measurement step for the energy\noutput. However, due to the relaxation process, a certain amount of acquired\ninformation is lost or becomes unavailable. So, controlling information loss\nduring relaxation is crucial for the overall efficiency of the engine. The net\n(available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback\ncontroller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore\nthe effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have\nmultiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the net available information\nand, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback\nprotocol. We examine the optimal performance requirements of the BIE and the\namount of maximum work output under different potential profiling. For\nmonostable trapping, a concave shape in confining potential results in a higher\nwork output than a convex one. We also find that hills and valleys in the\nconfining potential may lead to multiple good operating conditions. An\nappropriate shape modulation can create a heater-refrigerator transition and\ntheir reentrance due to non-trivial changes in information loss during the\nrelaxation process.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-14T15:19:33Z"}

The defining property of the Gaussian\ncore state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the\nphoton-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a\ncore state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and\nfinite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all\nnon-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis.\nFor pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with\nG_core pure and T unitary.

Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique\nstudent interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization\ntechniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics.

These insights unveil the drivers of social learning\ninteractions within a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and distributed ML\nframework -- an aspect that has not been explored before.","main_category":"cs.SI","categories":"cs.SI","published":"2025-04-14T17:43:11Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10460v1","title":"Target Pebbling in Trees","summary":"Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A\npebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an\nadjacent vertex. A configuration $C$ is a supply of pebbles at various vertices\nof a graph $G$, and a distribution $D$ is a demand of pebbles at various\nvertices of $G$. The $D$-pebbling number, $\\pi(G, D)$, of a graph $G$ is\ndefined to be the minimum number $m$ such that every configuration of $m$\npebbles can satisfy the demand $D$ via pebbling moves. The special case in\nwhich $t$ pebbles are demanded on vertex $v$ is denoted $D=v^t$, and the\n$t$-fold pebbling number, $\\pi_{t}(G)$, equals $\\max_{v\\in G}\\pi(G,v^t)$. It\nwas conjectured by Alc\\'on, Gutierrez, and Hurlbert that the pebbling numbers\nof chordal graphs forbidding the pyramid graph can be calculated in polynomial\ntime. Trees, of course, are the most prominent of such graphs. In 1989, Chung\ndetermined $\\pi_t(T)$ for all trees $T$. In this paper, we provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm to compute the pebbling numbers $\\pi(T,D)$ for all\ndistributions $D$ on any tree $T$, and characterize maximum-size configurations\nthat do not satisfy $D$.","main_category":"math.CO","categories":"math.CO","published":"2025-04-14T17:46:17Z"}

Unlike existing modular MLLMs, which rely on a\npre-trained vision transformer (ViT), SAIL eliminates the need for a separate\nvision encoder, presenting a more minimalist architecture design. Instead of\nintroducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention\nmechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align with the\ndistinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically\ncompare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow\npatterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs.\nBy scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance\ncomparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components\nenhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal\ninformation flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual\nrepresentation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision\ntasks such as semantic segmentation.

However, it is challenging to determine how to optimally\nadjust reconfigurable parameters for a given task, especially when the\ncontroller depends on the robot's configuration. In this paper, we address this\nproblem using a tendon-driven reconfigurable manipulator composed of multiple\nserially connected origami-inspired modules as an example. Under tendon\nactuation, these modules can achieve different shapes and motions, governed by\njoint stiffnesses (reconfiguration parameters) and the tendon displacements\n(control inputs). We leverage recent advances in co-optimization of design and\ncontrol for robotic system to treat reconfiguration parameters as design\nvariables and optimize them using reinforcement learning techniques. We first\nestablish a forward model based on the minimum potential energy method to\npredict the shape of the manipulator under tendon actuations. Using the forward\nmodel as the environment dynamics, we then co-optimize the control policy (on\nthe tendon displacements) and joint stiffnesses of the modules for goal\nreaching tasks while ensuring collision avoidance. Through co-optimization, we\nobtain optimized joint stiffness and the corresponding optimal control policy\nto enable the manipulator to accomplish the task that would be infeasible with\nfixed reconfiguration parameters (i.e., fixed joint stiffness). We envision the\nco-optimization framework can be extended to other reconfigurable robotic\nsystems, enabling them to optimally adapt their configuration and behavior for\ndiverse tasks and environments.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO","published":"2025-04-14T17:56:38Z"}

Focusing on the approximately back-to-back electroproduction of\na hadron-electron pair, we apply transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD)\nfactorization formulas that incorporate TMD evolution for both event-shape\nobservables and expand them in terms of the small-$x$ dipole amplitude. This\nallows us to write the TEEC off the transversely polarized proton in terms of a\nC-odd interaction, corresponding to an odderon exchange. Due to the\ncharge-conjugation-odd nature of the small-$x$ quark Sivers function, we\nrestrict the sum over final hadronic states to positively and negatively\ncharged hadrons separately. We present numerical predictions for the TEEC\nSivers asymmetry at the EIC and find the magnitude of the asymmetry to be on\nthe $0.1 \\%$ level.

Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk\nsilicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over\ndistances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an\nunderstanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces.\nHere, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of\nsurfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC,\nand we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their\nbulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling.\nFurthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an\nelectron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied\nsurface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that\nvanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles\nnaturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole\ncoupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant\npolarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and\nphotoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders\nof magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The\nnear-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the\ndevelopment of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to\nmediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic\ncircuits.","main_category":"physics.comp-ph","categories":"physics.comp-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph","published":"2025-04-14T17:58:59Z"}

Notably, considering an inflation-inspired\npower-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\\propto\nk^{n_\\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show\nthat the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the\nmaximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this\ncontribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The\nVIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological\nhorizon at the end of reheating, $k_\\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak\namplitude scaling as $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(k_{\\rm reh},\\eta_0)\\propto \\Delta N_{\\rm\nreh}\\times(H_{\\rm inf}/M_{\\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\\rm inf}$ is the Hubble\nparameter at the end of inflation and $\\Delta N_{\\rm reh}$ the duration of the\npost-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\\rm B}>-3/2$,\none further obtains a nearly $n_{\\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the\nGW spectrum of the form $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f,\\eta_0)\\propto \\left(\\frac{f}{f_{\\rm\nreh}}\\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f>f_\\mathrm{reh}\\equiv k_\\mathrm{reh}/(2\\pi)$.\nFinally, we need to highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the\ndetection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small\nscales.
