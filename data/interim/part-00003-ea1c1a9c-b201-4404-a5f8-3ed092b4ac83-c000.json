Considering the extensive variation in lane\nstructures worldwide, achieving high generalization capacity is particularly\nchallenging, as algorithms must accurately identify a wide variety of lane\npatterns worldwide. Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning\nlane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes\nexhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization\nlimitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and\nsubsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete\n3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we\npredict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict\nthe same keypoint using an offset mechanism.

Researchers have proposed many\nvariants to enhance the SZZ algorithm's performance since its introduction. The\nmajority of them rely on static techniques or heuristic assumptions, making\nthem easy to implement, but their performance improvements are often limited.\nRecently, a deep learning-based SZZ algorithm has been introduced to enhance\nthe original SZZ algorithm. However, it requires complex preprocessing and is\nrestricted to a single programming language. Additionally, while it enhances\nprecision, it sacrifices recall. Furthermore, most of variants overlook crucial\ninformation, such as commit messages and patch context, and are limited to\nbug-fixing commits involving deleted lines. The emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) offers an opportunity to address these drawbacks. In this study,\nwe investigate the strengths and limitations of LLMs and propose LLM4SZZ, which\nemploys two approaches (i.e., rank-based identification and context-enhanced\nidentification) to handle different types of bug-fixing commits. We determine\nwhich approach to adopt based on the LLM's ability to comprehend the bug and\nidentify whether the bug is present in a commit.

(2)\nMethods: For this observational study, 195 tinnitus patients answered an online\nsurvey on the mutual-help community Siopi. (3) Results: 160 patients could\nrecall their dreams. Among them, 92.5% state they do not hear their tinnitus\nwhile dreaming.

Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL.

However, training an SNN is much more expensive than training an\nANN, due to the use of the heuristic gradient descent strategy. In other words,\nthe process of SNN's potential membrane signal changing from sparse to dense is\nvery slow, which affects the convergence of the whole model.To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a novel distillation technique, called asymmetric framework\n(ANN-SNN) distillation, in which the teacher is an ANN and the student is an\nSNN. Specifically, we leverage the intermediate features (feature maps) learned\nby the ANN as hints to guide the training process of the SNN. This approach not\nonly accelerates the convergence of the SNN but also improves its final\nperformance, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of the SNN and\nthe superior learning capabilities of ANN. Extensive experimental results show\nthat our designed SNN-based image restoration model, which has only 1/300 the\nnumber of parameters of the teacher network and 1/50 the energy consumption of\nthe teacher network, is as good as the teacher network in some denoising tasks.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-02T14:12:06Z"}

The system consists of masses that are coupled by linear springs\nand are mounted on flexural beams whose cross section (and, hence, stiffness)\nis modulated. We show that this system is the simplest version possible to\nachieve the Hofstadter butterfly exactly; in particular, the local resonances\ndue to the beams are an essential component for this. We examine the various\napproaches to producing spectral butterflies, including Bloch spectra for\nrational parameter choices, resonances of finite-sized systems and transmission\ncoefficients of sections of finite length. For finite-size systems, we study\nthe localisation of the modes by calculating the inverse participation ratio,\nand detect a phase transition characterised by a critical value of the\nstiffness modulation amplitude, where the state of the system changes from\nmainly extended to localised, corresponding to a metal-insulator phase\ntransition. The obtained results offer a practical strategy to realize\nexperimentally a system with similar dynamical properties. The transmission\ncoefficient for sections of finite length is benchmarked through the comparison\nwith Bloch spectra of the same finite-sized systems. The numerical results for\nthe transmission spectra confirms the evidence of a phase transition in the\ndynamical state of the system.

The\napplications in nuclear environments require radiation resistance. The\ncharacteristics of Ge-doped MM fibers are investigated for Radiation Induced\nAttenuation (RIA) in Total Ionizing Dose (TID).\n  Methods: Commercial samples of Ge-doped MM fibers were irradiated in Go-60\ngamma rays at dose rates of 5 to 1.4k Gy(SiO2)/hr. The fiber samples were\npackaged in water tanks maintained at constant temperatures in the range of -15\nto 45 degC. The optical power transmitted through the fibers were recorded in\nirradiation, and in annealing when the source was shielded. The measurements of\nRIA in time are analyzed for dose rate and temperature dependences.\n  Results: Ge-doped fiber samples of OM2 to OM4 grades were investigated for\nattenuation of optical power in radiation ionizing dose. Depending on the\nfabrication technology, two of the fiber types show radiation resistance with\nthe RIAs of 0.2 dB/m and 0.05 dB/m, respectively, for the TID of 300 kGy(SiO2).\nAt low dose rate of 5 Gy/hr, the RIA increases steadily and the annealing of\nlow density ionizing defects does not cause notable deviation. At 1.4 kGy/hr\nthe accumulated defects result to twice higher RIA during irradiation, and is\nworsen to a factor three in cold temperature.

In the testing phase, they\nidentify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To\nlearn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and\ntrain a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to\nreconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution.\nDeviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which\nindicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably\ncauses information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal\nreconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we\npropose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D\nbrain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and\nreconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This\nprocess iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information\nfurther guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be\nreconstructed accurately, reducing false positives.

It offers a valuable measure for monitoring and interpreting trends\nin disease outcomes. When information on the cause of death is unavailable or\nunreliable, the Relative Survival (RS) framework is the preferred approach for\nestimating Net Survival, which represents survival in a hypothetical scenario\nwhere the disease of interest is the only possible cause of death. In the\ncontext of cancer, RS often reaches a plateau, indicating that a portion of\ndiagnosed patients is cured, as they have the same risk of dying as a\ncomparable group of healthy individuals with similar demographic\ncharacteristics. Classical RS cure models use logistic regression to estimate\nthe fraction of cured patients. However, this functional form is somewhat\narbitrary, and misspecifying it can severely distort the resulting cure\nindicators. Consequently, evaluations of the efficacy of cancer treatments at\nthe population level could be inaccurate, leading to biased decision-making\nregarding patient care. In this paper, we address this issue by relaxing the\nparametric assumption and considering flexible functions of the covariates\nwithin the framework of \\textit{Generalized Models} and \\textit{Neural\nNetworks}. We design an EM algorithm for these RS cure models and conduct a\nsimulation study to compare our proposals with the classical approach. We apply\nour methodology to a real-world dataset from a historical Italian cancer\nregistry. The results demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the\nclassical approach and provide valuable insights into the survival outcomes of\nItalian colon cancer patients.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME,stat.AP","published":"2025-04-07T14:00:37Z"}

To reduce this cost and\nleverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments,\nwe aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace\nhuman annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes\nrelevance, which indicates \"topic-relatedness\" of a document to a query, while\nin RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to\nanswer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM\nperformance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach\nrequires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited\ngeneralization.

Misusing roles can lead to\nprompt injection attacks, which can easily misalign the model's behavior with\nthe user's intentions, raising significant security concerns. Although various\nprompt injection attacks have been proposed, recent research has largely\noverlooked the impact of role separators on safety. This highlights the\ncritical need to thoroughly understand the systemic weaknesses in dialogue\nsystems caused by role separators. This paper identifies modeling weaknesses\ncaused by role separators. Specifically, we observe a strong positional bias\nassociated with role separators, which is inherent in the format of dialogue\nmodeling and can be triggered by the insertion of role separators. We further\ndevelop the Separators Injection Attack (SIA), a new orthometric attack based\non role separators. The experiment results show that SIA is efficient and\nextensive in manipulating model behavior with an average gain of 18.2% for\nmanual methods and enhances the attack success rate to 100% with automatic\nmethods.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.CR","published":"2025-04-08T05:20:56Z"}

Despite\nstrong performance on standard action recognition benchmarks, video\nself-supervised learning methods are largely evaluated under narrow protocols,\ntypically pretraining on Kinetics-400 and fine-tuning on similar datasets,\nlimiting our understanding of their generalization in real world scenarios. In\nthis work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of modern video\nself-supervised models, focusing on generalization across four key downstream\nfactors: domain shift, sample efficiency, action granularity, and task\ndiversity. Building on our prior work analyzing benchmark sensitivity in\nCNN-based contrastive learning, we extend the study to cover state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based video-only and video-text models. Specifically, we benchmark\n12 transformer-based methods (7 video-only, 5 video-text) and compare them to\n10 CNN-based methods, totaling over 1100 experiments across 8 datasets and 7\ndownstream tasks. Our analysis shows that, despite architectural advances,\ntransformer-based models remain sensitive to downstream conditions. No method\ngeneralizes consistently across all factors, video-only transformers perform\nbetter under domain shifts, CNNs outperform for fine-grained tasks, and\nvideo-text models often underperform despite large scale pretraining.

Notably, many attention heads\nin FoX tend to forget quickly, causing their output at each timestep to rely\nprimarily on the local context. Based on this observation, we propose Adaptive\nComputation Pruning (ACP) for FoX, a method that dynamically prunes\ncomputations involving input-output dependencies that are strongly decayed by\nthe forget gate. This is achieved using a dynamically set pruning threshold\nthat ensures that the pruned attention weights remain negligible. We apply ACP\nto language model pretraining with FoX and show it consistently reduces the\nnumber of FLOPs in softmax attention by around 70% across different model sizes\nand context lengths, resulting in a roughly 10% to 35% improvement in training\nthroughput. Furthermore, longer context lengths yield greater computational\nsavings. All these speed improvements are achieved without any performance\ndegradation.

Recently, data-driven methods such as sparse regression have been\nemployed to automatically uncover governing equations from data, representing a\nsignificant shift from traditional first-principles modeling. However, most\nexisting methods focus on scalar equations, limiting their applicability to\nsimple, low-dimensional scenarios, and failing to ensure rotation and\nreflection invariance without incurring significant computational cost or\nrequiring additional prior knowledge. This paper proposes a Cartesian\ntensor-based sparse regression (CTSR) technique to accurately and efficiently\nuncover complex, high-dimensional governing equations while ensuring\ninvariance. Evaluations on two two-dimensional (2D) and two three-dimensional\n(3D) test cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy\nand efficiency compared to the conventional technique.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T10:06:29Z"}

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations,\nsuch as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to\naddress these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent\nefforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack\nmethods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines\nsharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the\nknowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often\ndetectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness,\nand (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking\nformal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their\neffectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose\ncoordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack\nthat introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database\nwhile embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt.

Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is\ncrucial for language models of different sizes and applications. One of the\nmost widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag;\nhowever, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues.\nThese issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading\nprompts or equally correct options. Furthermore, we show that if models are\nevaluated only on answer texts, or with \"Lorem ipsum dolor...\" instead of the\nquestion, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot\nbe attributed merely to contamination. Since benchmark scores are an essential\npart of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these\nvalidity issues can have severe consequences. In particular, knowing that\ntaking benchmark scores at face value is ubiquitous, inadequate evaluation\nleads to ill-informed decisions about models. In this paper, we thoroughly\ninvestigate critical validity issues posed by HellaSwag and illustrate them\nwith various evaluations using generative language models of different sizes.\nWe argue that this benchmark does not accurately measure common-sense reasoning\nand, therefore, should not be used for evaluation in its current state.

Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability\ndensity estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between\nobjects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object\nand temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing.\nInspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a\nprogressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers\nfrom sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the\nbackbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global\nfeature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of\nsparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic\naffinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable\nhigh-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object\nrepresentation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and\nGlobal Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning\nmechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the\nprogressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport\nassignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each\ndenoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to\ncounteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects.\nExperiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method\nbased on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential\nrelationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection\ncapability and temporal consistency.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,I.4.8","published":"2025-04-14T14:44:52Z"}

However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges\nlinked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical\ndesign constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research\ngaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance\nIndicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness,\ndecentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a\ncustom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and\nanalysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance\npatterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration,\nwhich may undermine long-term viability.

In the case of three-body\ninteractions, the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential is highly relevant for\nthe quantitative prediction of material properties. The computation of the\nresulting energies in d-dimensional lattice systems is challenging, as a\nhigh-dimensional lattice sum needs to be evaluated to high precision. This work\nsolves this long-standing issue. We present an efficiently computable\nrepresentation of many-body lattice sums in terms of singular integrals over\nproducts of Epstein zeta functions. For three-body interactions in 3D, this\napproach reduces the runtime for computing the ATM lattice sum from weeks to\nminutes. Our approach further extends to a broad class of n-body lattice sums.\nWe demonstrate that the computational cost of our method only increases\nlinearly with n, evading the exponential increase in complexity of direct\nsummation. The evaluation of 51-body interactions on a two-dimensional lattice,\ncorresponding to a 100-dimensional sum, can be performed within seconds on a\nlaptop. We discuss techniques for computing the arising singular integrals and\ncompare the accuracy of our results against computable benchmarks, achieving\nfull precision for exponents greater than the system dimension. Finally, we\napply our method to study the stability of a three-dimensional lattice system\nwith Lennard-Jones two-body interactions under the inclusion of an ATM\nthree-body term at finite pressure, finding a transition from the\nface-centered-cubic to the body-centered-cubic lattice structure with\nincreasing ATM coupling strength.

Similar improvements are\nobserved with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By\noptimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves\nmodel performance but also improves training efficiency.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-04-17T06:29:28Z"}

Simultaneously, the\nobjective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and\nfrequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms\nto satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite\noptimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization\nproblems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite\nFederated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this\npaper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \\bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon\nproximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data\nheterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The\nintroduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing\ntracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients.\nAdditionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables,\nsignificantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates\nthat DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\\epsilon$-stationary point with an\niteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient,\nconsensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate\nof $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$.

Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on\nreal-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various\nhyperparameters on its performance.

While such capabilities empower various creative\napplications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can\nexploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these\nthreats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial\nperturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization\nmodels.

This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models,\nwhich help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures.\nUnfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for\nsome fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise.\nRather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of\nbudbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we\nintroduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels\n(TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more\naccurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is\navailable for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks\n(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and\nauxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is\nassumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict\nprimary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.\nSurprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our\nknowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we\npropose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that\ncan leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our\nresults on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape\ncultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve\ncold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-17T17:51:38Z"}

Current 3D\nMapping Aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques show great potentials in mitigating\nmultipath but face a critical trade-off between computational efficiency and\nmodeling accuracy. Most approaches often rely on offline outdated or\noversimplified 3D maps, while real-time LiDAR-based reconstruction boasts high\naccuracy, it is problematic in low laser reflectivity conditions; camera 3DMA\nis a good candidate to balance accuracy and efficiency but current methods\nsuffer from extremely low reconstruction speed, a far cry from real-time\nmultipath-mitigated navigation.

We report\nobservations of the Orion Nebula with the CONCERTO instrument, which was\ninstalled at the APEX telescope focal plane from April 2021 to December 2023.\nWe find that the spectrum of Orion is dominated by dust emission with an\nemissivity index from 1.3 to 2.0 along with the strong CO(2-1) and H$_2$O lines\nwhich are naturally separated from the continuum, thanks to CONCERTO spectral\ncapabilities. Many regions show a strong free-free emission as well, at lower\nfrequencies. We demonstrate the spectral capabilities of CONCERTO at\nintermediate spectral resolution, with a frequency coverage from 130 to 310\nGHz. A sensitivity of 200 mK is achieved in one second, for one beam and a 6\nGHz frequency width, over an 18 arcmin diameter field-of-view, which is within\na factor 3 of the expectations. We show that we can spectrally disentangle the\ncontinuum from the CO line emission. The slope of the millimetre continuum is\nline-free mapped for the first time in Orion.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM","published":"2025-04-29T07:25:42Z"}

We report new results based on millimeter observations performed with\nthe Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer, mapping the cold\nmolecular gas (CO) that feeds the star formation of distant BCGs. We selected\nthree among the strongest cool-core BCGs at intermediate redshifts\n($z\\simeq0.4$), namely RX 1532, MACS 1447, and CHIPS 1911.

The detection of such a system with significant\neccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical\nformation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve\ntheir spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary\nformed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa.\nKnowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular\nmomentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to\ncreate a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a\nnew publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using\norbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The\nspin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and\nspin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency,\neccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian\nparametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the\nleading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include\nthe quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in\nthe fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and\nYunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various\nfeatures of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession\nparameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the\ndependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the\ntransition point from one spin morphology to another can depend\nnonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given\nmorphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the\ninstantaneous eccentricity.","main_category":"gr-qc","categories":"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-29T08:40:07Z"}

The marginal distributions as well as dependencies\nbetween stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched.\n  With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of\nthe different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The\nelastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower\nstrain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material.\nRandomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of\ninelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the\nhomogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the\ndamage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings\nprovide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of\nheterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of\nmaterial structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.","main_category":"cs.CE","categories":"cs.CE,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mtrl-sci","published":"2025-04-29T15:37:27Z"}

Methods and\nResults: A comprehensive search identified 26 studies published before February\n2025, encompassing 3,802 patients. Compared to healthy individuals, CA patients\ndemonstrated significant echocardiographic abnormalities, including reduced\nleft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; WMD = -10.65, 95% CI: [-11.84,\n-9.46]), increased left atrial volume index (WMD = +15.87, 95% CI: [14.35,\n17.38]), and thickened posterior wall (WMD = +5.14, 95% CI: [4.85, 5.42]).\nSubtype analyses revealed that transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) was\nassociated with more pronounced systolic dysfunction than light-chain cardiac\namyloidosis (AL-CA), evidenced by lower global longitudinal strain (WMD =\n-2.02, 95% CI: [-2.66, -1.37]), reduced LVEF (WMD = -5.31, 95% CI: [-6.63,\n-3.99]), and diminished tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (WMD =\n-1.59, 95% CI: [-2.23, -0.95]).

Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to\nassess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation\nperspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show\nthat TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:\nOur system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future\nenhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:\nOur TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare\navailability.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-30T17:58:06Z"}

However, most of the related works treat the pickup and\ndelivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the\npickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the\ndelivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three\nmain challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately\ninterconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups\nhave stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it\nchallenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'\nspatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,\nbut have been insufficiently explored.

One promising approach to address this is RecJPQ,\nwhich replaces item embeddings with sub-item embeddings. However, slow\ninference remains problematic because finding the top highest-scored items\nusually requires scoring all items in the catalogue, which may not be feasible\nfor large catalogues. By adapting dynamic pruning concepts from document\nretrieval, we propose the RecJPQPrune dynamic pruning algorithm to efficiently\nfind the top highest-scored items without computing the scores of all items in\nthe catalogue. Our RecJPQPrune algorithm is safe-up-to-rank K since it\ntheoretically guarantees that no potentially high-scored item is excluded from\nthe final top K recommendation list, thereby ensuring no impact on\neffectiveness. Our experiments on two large datasets and three recommendation\nmodels demonstrate the efficiency achievable using RecJPQPrune: for instance,\non the Tmall dataset with 2.2M items, we can reduce the median model scoring\ntime by 64 times compared to the Transformer Default baseline, and 5.3 times\ncompared to a recent scoring approach called PQTopK. Overall, this paper\ndemonstrates the effective and efficient inference of Transformer-based\nrecommendation models at catalogue scales not previously reported in the\nliterature. Indeed, our RecJPQPrune algorithm can score 2 million items in\nunder 10 milliseconds without GPUs, and without relying on Approximate Nearest\nNeighbour (ANN) techniques.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-05-01T14:36:33Z"}

Methods:\nWe compare the performance of three vision language models and two\ndiscriminative models on two free-living validation studies with 161 and 111\nparticipants, collected in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom and Sichuan, China,\nrespectively, using the Autographer (OMG Life, defunct) wearable camera.\nResults: We found that the best open-source vision-language model (VLM) and\nfine-tuned discriminative model (DM) achieved comparable performance when\npredicting sedentary behaviour from single images on unseen participants in the\nOxfordshire study; median F1-scores: VLM = 0.89 (0.84, 0.92), DM = 0.91 (0.86,\n0.95). Performance declined for light (VLM = 0.60 (0.56,0.67), DM = 0.70 (0.63,\n0.79)), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (VLM = 0.66 (0.53,\n0.85); DM = 0.72 (0.58, 0.84)). When applied to the external Sichuan study,\nperformance fell across all intensity categories, with median Cohen's\nkappa-scores falling from 0.54 (0.49, 0.64) to 0.26 (0.15, 0.37) for the VLM,\nand from 0.67 (0.60, 0.74) to 0.19 (0.10, 0.30) for the DM. Conclusion: Freely\navailable computer vision models could help annotate sedentary behaviour,\ntypically the most prevalent activity of daily living, from wearable camera\nimages within similar populations to seen data, reducing the annotation burden.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-06T09:49:45Z"}

Active PFC circuitry typically\ncomprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current\nso that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of\nthe waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC\ninductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and\ninvestigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in\ndiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a\ncombination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC\ninductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion\nand, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This\npaper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct\npower-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency\neddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As\ndemonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level,\nexhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to\nthe somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing\nmagnetic flux at an air gap.

Therefore, early and accurate detection of potholes is\ncrucial.

In this\npaper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and\nan improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and\npothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was\nused to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a\nPothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable\nfor segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg\narchitecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution\n(DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit\n(GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure\nmore accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps\nwith high accuracy.

Since airline operations include many interlinked\ndecisions, an integrated approach leads to better overall solutions. We\nspecifically look at resolving these disruptions in both the aircraft and crew\nschedules. Resolving these disruptions is complex, especially when it is done\nin an integrated way, i.e. including multiple different resources.\n  To solve this problem in an integrated manner, we developed a fast simulated\nannealing approach.

Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized\ninfinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate\neven in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles.\nHowever, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of\nChandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems,\nthe analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test\nparticle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far,\nin spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or\nan effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field\nparticles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim\nat shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We\nperform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low\neccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution.\nWe use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the\nbackground particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth\npotential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order\ncontributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake\ncan be neglected if needed.

Tiwari\net al 2017 present evidence that, besides depending on loop length and other\nfactors, the brightness of a coronal loop depends on the field strength in the\nloop feet and the freedom of convection in the feet. While it is known that\nstrong solar magnetic fields suppress convection, the decrease in the speed of\nhorizontal advection of magnetic flux with increasing field strength has not\nbeen quantified before. We quantify that trend by analyzing 24hours of HMI\nSHARP vector magnetograms of each of six sunspot active regions and their\nsurroundings. Using Fourier Local Correlation Tracking, we estimate the\nhorizontal advection speed of the magnetic flux at each pixel in which the\nvertical component of the magnetic field strength (Bz) is well above (greater\nthan or equal to 150 G) noise level. We find that the average horizontal\nadvection speed of magnetic flux steadily decreases as Bz increases, from 110\npm 3 meters per sec for 150 G (in network and plage) to 10 pm 4 meters per sec\nfor 2500 G (in sunspot umbra). The trend is well fit by a fourth degree\npolynomial. These results quantitatively confirm the expectation that magnetic\nflux advection is suppressed by increasing magnetic field strength. The\npresented quantitative relation should be useful for future MHD simulations of\ncoronal heating.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-05-07T15:33:16Z"}

Recent research has\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities\nby interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these\napproaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)\nUncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search\nengines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the\ntraining process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of\nLLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B\nLLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves\ncomparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module\neven surpasses it.

As such,\nwith the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning\ntools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as\nthe Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to\ndate have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed\nthat the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual)\nvector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge\nembeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.\n  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to\nlink prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs\nand state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective\nthat models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather\nthan individual nodes and edges.\n  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis\nconcludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both\nviable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG\ntransfer learning for the link prediction task.

In the presence of traveling delays, the\njoin-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and\nprolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the\nrandomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the\noscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station\nwith a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a\nsmall fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The\nadditional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to\nas the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the\nbalancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the\nstations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is\nachieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction,\nby which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint\nproblem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for\ngeographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the\nRJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest\nstations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated\nsingle-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays.

Due to the asymptotic freedom at the short distances,\nafter proper factorization, one can predict the value of high-energy physical\nobservable by using the perturbative QCD (pQCD). It has been demonstrated that\nby recursively using of renormalization group equation with the help of\nPrinciple of Maximum Conformality (PMC), one can eliminate conventional\nrenormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities existed in the initial fixed-order\npQCD series. To extend the predictive power of pQCD, we are still facing the\nproblem of how to reliably estimate the contributions from the unknown\nhigher-order (UHO) terms. In this paper, using the PMC scheme-and-scale\ninvariant series as the starting point, we suggest a novel method of using\nlinear regression through the origin (LRTO) to fix the asymptotic form of the\npQCD series, which subsequently predicts the reasonable magnitude of the\none-order higher UHO-terms. As an explicit example, we apply the method to deal\nwith the ratio $R_\\tau$, which has been calculated up to four-loop QCD\ncorrections. Our results show that the LRTO method works well, demonstrating\nits reliability and significant predictive power for estimating the UHO-terms.\nEspecially, we show that the scale-invariant and more convergent PMC series\nexhibits a much better predictive power with stability and reliability than the\ninitial scale-dependent pQCD series.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph","published":"2025-05-08T11:09:40Z"}

Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up\nsurvey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three\nclassification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two\nnovel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive\nexperiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in\nspatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a\npositive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its\nperformance on an embodied AI task.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-08T17:45:44Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470v1","title":"Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL","summary":"We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:\n(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation\n(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,\nenabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction\nstrategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original\ninference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without\nperformance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple\ntext-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly\nperfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting\nGenEval accuracy from $63\\%$ to $95\\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy\nimproves from $59\\%$ to $92\\%$, significantly enhancing text generation.\nFlow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.\nNotably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase\nat the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our\nexperiments.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-05-08T17:58:45Z"}
