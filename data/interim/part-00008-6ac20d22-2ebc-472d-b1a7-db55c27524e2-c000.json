Here, we propose using\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\ndynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and\nanisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other\nexchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by\n$45^\\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a\nDirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions. We finally extract\ncritical thresholds where light reverses DM interactions along one axis or\nbalances both in-plane components.

Firstly,\nobserving that modeling context interaction over the entire coarse feature map\nelicits highly redundant computation due to the neighboring representation\nsimilarity of tokens, a covisibility-guided token condenser is introduced to\nadaptively aggregate tokens in light of their covisibility scores that are\ndynamically estimated, thereby ensuring computational efficiency while\nimproving the representational capacity of aggregated tokens simultaneously.\nSecondly, considering that feature interaction with massive non-covisible areas\nis distracting, which may degrade feature distinctiveness, a\ncovisibility-assisted attention mechanism is deployed to selectively suppress\nirrelevant message broadcast from non-covisible reduced tokens, resulting in\nrobust and compact attention to relevant rather than all ones. Thirdly, we find\nthat at the fine-level stage, current methods adjust only the target view's\nkeypoints to subpixel level, while those in the source view remain restricted\nat the coarse level and thus not informative enough, detrimental to keypoint\nlocation-sensitive usages. A simple yet potent fine correlation module is\ndeveloped to refine the matching candidates in both source and target views to\nsubpixel level, attaining attractive performance improvement.

For\nAFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and\nunstable avoided crossings (UAC), with the first-excited branch undergoing a\ndouble unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions,\nonly a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited\nbranches, is observed.

In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify\nthe underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped\n$L$PO$_{4}$ series.

The valley polarization is maximized\nwhen the Fermi wave vector of the normal metal is approximately half the\nseparation between the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in graphene.

The conductance through graphene increases\nwith its width, while an increase in length initially reduces the conductance\nbefore leading to oscillatory behavior due to Fabry-P\\'erot interference.

However, its real-world application often fails due to a\nlack of user acceptance and trust. A possible remedy is to provide managers\nwith the possibility of altering the RL policy by incorporating human expert\nknowledge. In this study, we analyze the benefits and caveats of including\nhuman knowledge via action masking. While action masking has so far been used\nto exclude invalid actions, its ability to integrate human expertise remains\nunderexplored. Human knowledge is often encapsulated in heuristics, which\nsuggest reasonable, near-optimal actions in certain situations. Enforcing such\nactions should hence increase trust among the human workforce to rely on the\nmodel's decisions. Yet, a strict enforcement of heuristic actions may also\nrestrict the policy from exploring superior actions, thereby leading to overall\nlower performance. We analyze the effects of action masking based on three\nproblems with different characteristics, namely, paint shop scheduling, peak\nload management, and inventory management. Our findings demonstrate that\nincorporating human knowledge through action masking can achieve substantial\nimprovements over policies trained without action masking. In addition, we find\nthat action masking is crucial for learning effective policies in constrained\naction spaces, where certain actions can only be performed a limited number of\ntimes. Finally, we highlight the potential for suboptimal outcomes when action\nmasks are overly restrictive.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,math.OC","published":"2025-04-03T15:00:04Z"}

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in a\nvariety of plasma technologies, including Hall thrusters, where azimuthal\ninstabilities significantly influence electron confinement and, hence, device\nperformance. While the impact of prominent plasma instabilities, such as the\nelectron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream\ninstability (MTSI) on cross-field transport of electron species is well\nrecognized and widely studied, strategies for actively manipulating these\ndynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the effect of\ntargeted wave excitation on instability evolution and electron transport using\none- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of representative plasma\ndischarge configurations. A time-varying electric field is applied axially to\nmodulate the spectral energy distribution of the instabilities across a range\nof forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Our results reveal that the so-called\n\"unsteady forcing\" can both suppress and amplify instability modes depending on\nexcitation parameters. In particular, across both 1D and 2D simulation\nconfigurations, forcing near 40 MHz effectively reduces ECDI amplitude and\ndecreases axial electron transport by about 30%, while high-frequency\nexcitation near the electron cyclotron frequency induces spectral broadening,\ninverse energy cascades, and enhanced transport.

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for\nprecise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred\nintermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation.

Among various guidance strategies presented in literature,\nlook-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant\nattention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low\ncross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded\nlateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes\nproblematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce\nhigher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high\nvariation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of\nlook-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance\nstrategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized\n$L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference\npath in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the\nvehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of\ncorrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to\ngenerate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root\nmean square of the cross-track error thereafter.

This paper\nexplores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design\nlevers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to\nstudy chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these\nexperiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in\nchatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently\nthan expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this\nunderutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a\nprocess with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a\nsecond, expert service stage -- a behavior we term \"gatekeeper aversion\". We\nshow that gatekeeper aversion can be further amplified by a secondary hurdle,\nalgorithm aversion. Second, chatbot uptake can be increased by providing\ncustomers with average waiting times in the chatbot channel, as well as by\nbeing more transparent about chatbot capabilities and limitations. Third,\nmethodologically, we show that chatbot adoption can depend on experimental\nimplementation. In particular, chatbot adoption decreases further as (i) stakes\nare increased, (ii) the human/algorithmic nature of the server is manipulated\nwith more realism. Our results suggest that firms should continue to prioritize\ninvestments in chatbot technology. However, less expensive, process-related\ninterventions can also be effective. These may include being more transparent\nabout the types of queries that are (or are not) suitable for chatbots,\nemphasizing chatbot reliability and quick resolution times, as well as\nproviding faster live agent access to customers who experienced chatbot\nfailure.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC,econ.GN,q-fin.EC,J.4","published":"2025-04-08T15:40:31Z"}

A Bayesian\nbivariate meta-analysis was used to evaluate surrogate relationships between\nthe treatment effects on A$\\beta$ and clinical function, with the intercept,\nslope and variance quantifying the trial level association. The analysis was\nperformed using RCT data both collectively across all MABs and separately for\neach MAB through subgroup analysis.

We\npropose a machine learning approach to correct the impact of interlopers at the\nlevel of measured summary statistics, focusing on the power spectrum monopole\nand line interlopers as a proof of concept. To model interloper effects, we use\nhalo catalogs from the Quijote simulations as proxies for galaxies, displacing\na fraction of halos by the distance corresponding to the redshift offset\nbetween target and interloper galaxies. This yields contaminated catalogs with\nvarying interloper fractions across a wide range of cosmologies from the\nQuijote suite. We train a neural network on the power spectrum monopole, alone\nor combined with the bispectrum monopole, from contaminated mocks to estimate\nthe interloper fraction and reconstruct the cleaned power spectrum. We evaluate\nperformance in two settings: one with fixed cosmology and another where\ncosmological parameters vary under broad priors. In the fixed case, the network\nrecovers the interloper fraction and corrects the power spectrum to better than\n1% accuracy. When cosmology varies, performance degrades, but adding bispectrum\ninformation significantly improves results, reducing the interloper fraction\nerror by 40-60%. We also study the method's performance as a function of the\nsize of the training set and find that optimal strategies depend on the\ncorrelation between target and interloper samples: bispectrum information aids\nperformance when target and interloper galaxies are uncorrelated, while tighter\npriors are more effective when the two are strongly correlated.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-04-09T14:24:19Z"}

In this paper, we systematically compare these\ntwo approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.\nSurprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on\nCountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not\nuniversally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to\ndegrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into\nsuboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage\n\"implicit\" (non-verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement\nlearning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit\nsignificantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see\nlimited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that\nbacktracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex\ninteraction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning\nparadigm.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T17:12:49Z"}

Going beyond final accuracy,\nwe propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output\nfrom language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks:\nunderstanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow\nfrom them. The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with\nthe goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs\nunderstand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can\nthey infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? Since existing benchmarks\nmay be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency\non novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. On novel grade school math\nproblems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of\ninput premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of\nreasoning hops is increased. Interestingly, these errors are masked in the\noriginal benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy. As we increase the\nnumber of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple\nhops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input\npremises. Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural\npropagation of early errors do not explain the trends. Our analysis provides a\nnew view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input\npremises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across\nproblem domains.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T17:53:55Z"}

We investigate the physical implications of\nthis phenomenon. In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two\nelectromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of\nthe two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when\nlinear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the\ntotal polarization degree conserved. However, incoherent superposition can lead\nto depolarization. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent\nsuperposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be\ncomparable when jumps occur, placing constraints on the intrinsic radiation\nmechanisms. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation\nmechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps\nby generating two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a\ngeometric effect due to sweeping line-of-sight is a more plausible reason. This\nrequires the emission region to be within the magnetosphere of a spinning\ncentral engine, likely a magnetar.

Recent advances in\ngenerative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development\nof uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative\nmodel-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on\nthe underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the\nposterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian\nneural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic)\nuncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction\nmethod by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters.\nUnfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly\nquantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still\npersists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an\nexisting generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and\nintroduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian\nneural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by\nleveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be\neasily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated\nthe proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and\nimage inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric\nuncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the\ncharacteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.\nFurthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on\ntop of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent\nwith frequentist principles.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T12:30:46Z"}

While many voices\nhighlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to\nthe conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue\nthat technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful\nethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on\nDe Jong & De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I\nclarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I\ncontend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding\nof what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by\nextension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement\ncapacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts -\ntend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics.\nInstead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach:\nfostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis\nfor ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic\nrequirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for\nparticipation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical\nexpertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing\nnot only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph,quant-ph","published":"2025-04-10T12:38:45Z"}

Many previous SPH porous\nflow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid\ninterface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid\nand solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows\nus to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account\nand results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can\nsimulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid\nand solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit\nforces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces.

We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely\ndrag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic\nbehavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening,\nwe propose an extension to the elasticity model.

To mitigate such biases, prior studies have\nattempted to project model embeddings into unbiased spaces during inference.\nHowever, these approaches have shown limited effectiveness due to their weak\nalignment with downstream social biases. Inspired by the observation that\nconcept cognition in LLMs is primarily represented through a linear associative\nmemory mechanism, where key-value mapping occurs in the MLP layers, we posited\nthat biased concepts and social groups are similarly encoded as entity (key)\nand information (value) pairs, which can be manipulated to promote fairer\nassociations. To this end, we propose Fairness Mediator (FairMed), a bias\nmitigation framework that neutralizes stereotype associations. Our framework\ncomprises two main components: a stereotype association prober and an\nadversarial debiasing neutralizer. The prober captures stereotype associations\nencoded within MLP layer activations by employing prompts centered around\nbiased concepts to detect the emission probabilities for social groups.\nSubsequently, the adversarial debiasing neutralizer intervenes in MLP\nactivations during inference to equalize the association probabilities among\ndifferent social groups. Extensive experiments across nine protected attributes\nshow that FairMed significantly outperforms SOTA methods in effectiveness.\nCompared to the most effective baseline, FairMed presents competitive\nefficiency by cutting mitigation overhead by hundreds of minutes.

In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference,\nsafety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward\nmodeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference\ntransferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled\ngenerations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward\nfunction for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training\nreward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less\ntime than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are\navailable. Specifically, we develop \\textit{RefAlign}, a versatile\nREINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward\nmodels.

The discrete Boltzmann method\n(DBM) provides a multiscale kinetic modeling framework and analysis tool to\ncapture complex discrete/nonequilibrium effects. While the numerical scheme\nplays a fundamental role in DBM simulations, a comprehensive stability analysis\nremains lacking. Similar to LBM, the complexity mainly arises from the\nintrinsic coupling between velocity and spatiotemporal discretizations,\ncompared with CFD. This study applies von Neumann stability analysis to\ninvestigate key factors influencing DBM simulation stability, including\nphase-space discretization, thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) levels,\nspatiotemporal schemes, initial conditions, and model parameters. Key findings\ninclude: (i) the moment-matching approach outperforms expansion- and\nweighting-based methods in the test simulations; (ii) increased TNE enhances\nsystem nonlinearity and the intrinsic nonlinearity embedded in the model\nequations, amplifying instabilities; (iii) additional viscous dissipation based\non distribution functions improves stability but distorts flow fields and\nalters constitutive relations; (iv) larger CFL numbers and relative time steps\ndegrade stability, necessitating appropriate time-stepping strategies. To\nassess the stability regulation capability of DBMs across TNE levels,\nstability-phase diagrams and probability curves are constructed via\nmorphological analysis within the moment-matching framework. These diagrams\nidentify common stable parameter regions across model orders. This study\nreveals key factors and coupling mechanisms affecting DBM stability and\nproposes strategies for optimizing equilibrium distribution discretization,\nvelocity design, and parameter selection in supersonic regimes.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-14T13:04:58Z"}

However, these methods usually adopt the\nstandard full fine-tuning paradigm, which requires the optimization of\nconsiderable backbone parameters, causing extensive computational and storage\nrequirements. In this work, we propose an efficient prompt-tuning framework\ntailored for multi-modal object re-identification, dubbed DMPT, which freezes\nthe main backbone and only optimizes several newly added decoupled\nmodality-aware parameters. Specifically, we explicitly decouple the visual\nprompts into modality-specific prompts which leverage prior modality knowledge\nfrom a powerful text encoder and modality-independent semantic prompts which\nextract semantic information from multi-modal inputs, such as visible,\nnear-infrared, and thermal-infrared. Built upon the extracted features, we\nfurther design a Prompt Inverse Bind (PromptIBind) strategy that employs bind\nprompts as a medium to connect the semantic prompt tokens of different\nmodalities and facilitates the exchange of complementary multi-modal\ninformation, boosting final re-identification results.

However, there are indications that cold dark matter may\nencounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly\nat galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models\nincorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale\nproblems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark\nmatter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning\ninto the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly\nincreases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold\ndark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\\rm de}$),\nand dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of\nstate ($w_{\\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark\nenergy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze\ninteracting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these\nscenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their\ncombination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our\nanalyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot\nbe excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets,\nthere is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more\nthan 95\\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of\nstate lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This\nstudy suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter\ncomponent should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological\nimplications, as reflected in the present work.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc","published":"2025-04-16T11:10:56Z"}

This is quantified by\nthe Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of\nlight states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be\nlower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation,\nleading to an additional problem of initial conditions.

Patent matching is a crucial task in\nintellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and\nutilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents\ndirectly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and\noverlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of\npatents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent\nmatching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from\ntheir parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their\nmemory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing\nthese entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph,\nwe utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM\nin comprehending the semantics of patents.

However,\nexisting approaches often overlook the quality variations in local features and\nfail to fully leverage the complementary information across modalities,\nparticularly in the case of low-quality features. In this paper, we propose to\naddress this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the\nModality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first\nconstruct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between\npatches.

Finally, the swapped modality-aware graphs are fed into the\nlocal-aware graph reasoning module, which propagates multi-modal information to\nyield a reliable feature representation. Another advantage of the proposed\ngraph reasoning approach is its ability to reconstruct missing modal\ninformation by exploiting inherent structural relationships, thereby minimizing\ndisparities between different modalities.

First, fast\nadversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which\nseverely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video\nadversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training\ntimes and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency\n(VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data.\nSpecifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it\nintegrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation\n(TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a\nsingle-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it\ndevises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which\nseamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG.\nLeveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from\nsimple to complex augmentations.

This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both\ntarget labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain\nadaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data,\ntime series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source\ntime series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply\nfine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose\nthe learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal\npatterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to\ndisentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional\narchitecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a\nU-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the\ninitial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step\nto prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer\nadaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a\nresidual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation\nbranch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's\noutput. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their\ncomposition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is\ndisentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is\nretained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the\ntraining, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay\nbranch to tolerate instance-wise variation.

Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions\ninvolving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning\n(ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge\ndeficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries\ninvolving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training\nstrategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from\nleveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or\nadopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of\nreasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper\ninvestigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL\nperformance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following\nLLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT,\nwith and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution\naccuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that\ncombines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL\nproves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit\nfrom SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their\n(weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models\nand datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and\nmultiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks\nto a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and\noptimization of the execution accuracy. Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5\nmodel performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.DB","published":"2025-04-21T13:05:26Z"}

The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for\nany spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of\nthe dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size\ndistribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of\nthe impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the\norbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that\nleads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then\npopulated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that\nthe dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending\nradially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles\ntend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density\nis negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the\nring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a\nfirst estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii\nbetween 2 $\\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg).

Although\nrecent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their\ncapabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and\ndeformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the\nlack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under\ndiverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for\ngenerating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper\nintroduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac\nfeatures a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional\ntactile sensors \\sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip\ndetection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips.\nFurthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis\npipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based\non this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm\nrobotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp\npaper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an\noverall success rate of 87.5\\%.

Creating a large training dataset encompassing\nall relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the\ncomputational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor.\nCommonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain.\nHere, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast\nprobabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts\nback to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not\nrequired to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a\nsignificant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating\nphases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These\nphases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty.\nWhen the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a\nlocal transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a\nhighly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to\nachieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field\nmodel to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for\nthe phase mixing.

Jet-interstellar medium (ISM)\ninteraction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to\nstudy jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock\nnear one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock\nstructure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its\nlifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock\nstructure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM.

This\ndenoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods\nthat treated all training samples as equal.

In this work, we present a defect physics perspective on the effect\nof semiconductor band structure on electrochemical redox reactions.\nSpecifically, the Haldane-Anderson model, originally developed to study\nmultiple charge states of transition-metal defects in semiconductors, is\nextended to describe electrochemical redox reactions by incorporating the\nsolvent effect, inspired by the Holstein model. The solvent coordinate and the\nactual charge on the redox species in reduced and oxidized states are assumed\nto be instant equilibrium, and the transitions between these states are defined\nby the framework of Green's function. With these treatments, we treat the\ncharge state transition in a self-consistent manner. We first confirm that this\nself-consistent approach is essential to accurately depict the hybridization\neffect of band structure by comparing the model-calculated ionization potential\n(IP), electron affinity (EA), and redox potential of the species with those\nobtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Next, we illustrate\nhow this self-consistent treatment enhances our understanding of the catalytic\nactivities of semiconductor electrodes and the source of asymmetry in\nreorganization energies, which is often observed in prior ab initio molecular\ndynamics (AIMD) simulations.

On the other\nhand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately\nlarger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical\nfor large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that\nwhen there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR\ndiffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so.\nOn the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across\npatches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-30T04:57:12Z"}

When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it\ncreates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot\nproperties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar\nvariability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map\nrepresentation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of\nStarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for\nspot-crossing events during transits.

We demonstrate\nthat both types of scaling have become extremely difficult, wasteful, and\ncostly due to the dominant processor-centric design & execution paradigm of\ncomputers, which treats memory as a dumb and inactive component that cannot\nperform any computation. We show that moving to a memory-centric design &\nexecution paradigm can solve the major challenges, while enabling multiple\nother potential benefits. In particular, we demonstrate that: 1) memory\ntechnology scaling problems (e.g., RowHammer, RowPress, Variable Read\nDisturbance, data retention, and other issues awaiting to be discovered) can be\nmuch more easily and efficiently handled by enabling memory to autonomously\nmanage itself; 2) system and application performance & energy efficiency can,\nat the same time, be improved by orders of magnitude by enabling computation\ncapability in memory chips and structures (i.e., processing in memory). We\ndiscuss adoption challenges against enabling memory-centric computing, and\ndescribe how we can get there step-by-step via an evolutionary path.","main_category":"cs.AR","categories":"cs.AR,cs.DC","published":"2025-05-01T11:16:09Z"}

However,\nthese architectural advancements introduce additional latency during the\ninitial attachment procedure of User Equipment (UE), increasing the risk of\nsignaling storms. This paper investigates the latency impact due to\ndisaggregation of the Base-band Unit (BBU) into the Central Unit (CU) and\nDistributed Unit (DU). Specifically, we model the delays induced due to\ndisaggregation on UE attachment, analyzing the performance under varying load\nconditions, and sensitivity to processing times. We demonstrate that while both\nmonolithic and Open RAN architectures experience performance degradation under\nhigh-load conditions, Open RAN's added overheads can increase its\nsusceptibility to congestion and signaling storms. However, Open RAN's inherent\nflexibility, enabled by disaggregation and virtualization, allows efficient\ndeployment of resources, faster service deployment, and adaptive congestion\ncontrol mechanisms to mitigate these risks and enhance overall system\nresilience. Thereby, we quantify resilience by introducing a new utility\nfunction and propose a novel adaptation mechanism to reinforce Open RAN's\nrobustness against signaling storms. Our results show that the proposed\nadaptive mechanism significantly enhances resilience, achieving improvements of\nup to 286% over fixed configurations, with resilience scores approaching 0.96\nunder optimal conditions. While simulation results show that Open RAN\ndisaggregation increases attachment latency and susceptibility to signaling\ncongestion, they also highlight that its architectural flexibility can mitigate\nthese effects, improving resilience under high-load conditions.","main_category":"cs.NI","categories":"cs.NI","published":"2025-05-01T15:35:31Z"}

Although\nmost existing AO systems employ this methodology, the literature on atmospheric\nturbulence correction and AO system design generally focuses on performance at\na single wavelength, neglecting the two-wavelength nature of the problem. In\nthis paper, we undertake a rigorous study of the relevant wavefront errors\nnecessary to quantify two-wavelength AO system performance.\n  Since most AO systems employ separate tilt and higher-order correcting\nsubsystems, our analysis mirrors this division, and we begin with higher-order\nwavefront errors. Utilizing Mellin transform techniques, we derive closed-form\nrelations for the piston-removed and piston- and tilt-removed variances. The\nformer is a measure of the total, residual wavefront error that a\ntwo-wavelength AO systems experiences; while the latter, quantifies the\nresidual wavefront error due to higher-order aberrations.\n  We then proceed to tilt or tracking errors and derive the two-wavelength\nZernike- and gradient-tilt variances. Zernike tilt is the actual amount of tilt\nin the turbulent atmosphere; yet, most AO tracking subsystems measure gradient\ntilt. Consequently, we also derive the two-wavelength gradient-tilt,\nZernike-tilt variance -- also known as centroid anisoplanatism -- to quantify\nthis error.\n  Lastly, we validate our analysis by performing two-wavelength wave-optics\nsimulations and comparing the results to theory. We observe excellent agreement\namong the simulated results and our theoretical predictions.\n  The analysis and findings presented in this paper will be useful in the\ncharacterization of existing, and the design of new, two-wavelength AO systems.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-05-01T15:38:21Z"}

Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is\na promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage\nframework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on\neach reasoning step of math solutions.
