SCANAR automates the retrieval and\nprocessing of news articles, offering functionalities such as de-duplication\nand unsupervised relevancy ranking. AIDOC aids filtration by leveraging AI to\nreorder textual data based on relevancy, employing neural networks for semantic\nsimilarity, and subsequently prioritizing likely relevant entries for human\nreview.

By measuring\nacoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe\ndeviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are\ncaused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These\ndeviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the\nstar during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep\nregime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence\nof cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is\nessential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations\nand the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective\nenvelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small\nseparations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well\nafter the main sequence.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-02T15:37:26Z"}

Of late,\nthere is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the\nenvironment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are\ninfluenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information\nabout the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like\nusually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by\nthe players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true\nstate erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may\nadopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in\ndifferent perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player\nwould be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an\nincomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces.

Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this,\nbut have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and\ndirection-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of\nobservations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range.\nMany tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to\ninfer gains.

Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially\nobscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a\nsmooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and\nhow this affects gain-calibration results.

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure.

A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot\nin a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium\ninductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF\nreflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need\nfor directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot\ncharge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of\nRF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is\nfound to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration\ntimes are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry\nset-ups.

Consequently, noticeable recommendation accuracy drops are\nobserved, restricting the stealthiness of the attack.

However, previous works have primarily focused on\ntwo-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather\nthan pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative\ninvestments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear\npublic goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the\ncooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating\nbenefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit\nfunction, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the\nthreshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For\nintermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies\ncan coexist.

Various statistical methods have\nbeen proposed for AE signal detection in these databases, flagging\ndrug-specific AEs with disproportionately high observed counts compared to\nexpected counts under independence. However, signal detection remains\nchallenging for rare AEs or newer drugs, which receive small observed and\nexpected counts and thus suffer from reduced statistical power. Principled\ninformation sharing on signal strengths across drugs/AEs is crucial in such\ncases to enhance signal detection.

In this work, we position fusion depth, scalability, and\ndedicated multimodal capacity as primary factors for effective fusion. We\nintroduce DeepMLF, a novel multimodal language model (LM) with learnable tokens\ntailored toward deep fusion. DeepMLF leverages an audiovisual encoder and a\npretrained decoder LM augmented with multimodal information across its layers.\nWe append learnable tokens to the LM that: 1) capture modality interactions in\na controlled fashion and 2) preserve independent information flow for each\nmodality. These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal\nself-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through\ncross-attention MM Blocks. Serving as dedicated multimodal capacity, this\ndesign enables progressive fusion across multiple layers, providing depth in\nthe fusion process. Our training recipe combines modality-specific losses and\nlanguage modelling loss, with the decoder LM tasked to predict ground truth\npolarity. Across three MSA benchmarks with varying dataset characteristics,\nDeepMLF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results confirm that deeper\nfusion leads to better performance, with optimal fusion depths (5-7) exceeding\nthose of existing approaches. Additionally, our analysis on the number of\nfusion tokens reveals that small token sets ($\\sim$20) achieve optimal\nperformance. We examine the importance of representation learning order (fusion\ncurriculum) through audiovisual encoder initialization experiments.

However, the\nlow-dimensional embeddings are often difficult to interpret. To facilitate the\nexploration and interpretation of low-dimensional embeddings, we introduce a\nnew concept named partitioning with explanations. The idea is to partition the\ndata shown through the embedding into groups, each of which is given a sparse\nexplanation using the original high-dimensional attributes. We introduce an\nobjective function that quantifies how much we can learn through observing the\nexplanations of the data partitioning, using information theory, and also how\ncomplex the explanations are. Through parameterization of the complexity, we\ncan tune the solutions towards the desired granularity. We propose InfoClus,\nwhich optimizes the partitioning and explanations jointly, through greedy\nsearch constrained over a hierarchical clustering. We conduct a qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of InfoClus on three data sets. We contrast the results\non the Cytometry data with published manual analysis results, and compare with\ntwo other recent methods for explaining embeddings (RVX and VERA).

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a doped HfO2-based, silicon-compatible\nasymmetric resonant ferroelectric tunnel junction design with a quantum well\nembedded between two ferroelectric layers, replacing the conventional\nmetal-ferroelectric-metal structure. Using a self-consistent coupling of the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we\ndemonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading\nto a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the\ntunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust,\nwhile the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and\nreducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well\nsignificantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak\nvalue of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the\nresistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V.

Recently, deep learning methods have\nbeen widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has\nthree main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer.\nWhile the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of\nsolution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc,\nleaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an\nunsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed\nPINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to\nfind the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural\nnetworks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each\nlayer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture\nparameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of\nPINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our\napproach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior\nusage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as\nthe associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on\nseveral benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers'\nequations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS\nachieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting\nobservation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a\nprominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that\narchitectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior\nperformance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.","main_category":"math.NA","categories":"math.NA,cs.NA","published":"2025-04-15T12:42:32Z"}

Complementing this, we propose the Content-Noise Decomposition\nNetwork (CNDN), which refines the descriptor distributions to better align with\nwell-lit conditions by mitigating noise and other distortions, thereby\neffectively restoring content representations to low-light images. The CAT and\nthe CNDN collectively act as a physical prior, guiding the transformation\nprocess from low-light to normal-light domains. Our proposed PiCat framework\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across\nfive benchmark datasets.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-16T09:23:38Z"}

This progression, in turn, lays the\ngroundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity\nConjecture (WGC). Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the\nReissner-Nordstr$\\\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to\nsustain super-extremality of the charge parameter. If such conditions arise,\nthese black holes transition into naked singularities-a scenario that is highly\nundesirable due to the loss of causality and the breakdown of space-time\ngeometry.

QAOA was later extended\nto the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+), which generalizes the\ninitial state, phase-separation operator, and mixer to address constrained\nproblems without relying on the standard Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) formulation. However, QAOA+ often requires additional\nancilla qubits and a large number of multi-controlled Toffoli gates to prepare\nthe superposition of feasible states, resulting in deep circuits that are\nchallenging for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, VQAs are generally\nhindered by issues such as barren plateaus and suboptimal local minima.\nRecently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a ground-state preparation\nalgorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE\nhas demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has\nbeen applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. In this\nwork, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple\nKnapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained\noptimization using VarQITE. We show that VarQITE achieves significantly lower\nmean optimality gaps compared to QAOA and other conventional methods. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that scaling the Hamiltonian coefficients can further reduce\noptimization costs and accelerate convergence.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-17T03:09:37Z"}

These methods\noften encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of\nphotorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines\ngeometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for\ntransparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on\ngeometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.\nIn the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular\nmodeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric\naccuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth\nextraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending\nweights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust\nweighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task\nunder realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex\ntransparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that\nTSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of\ntransparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.\nSpecifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a\n37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score\ncompared to the top baseline.

To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), a dynamic\nsparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context\nmulti-modal inputs. First, our analysis reveals that the temporal and spatial\nlocality of video input leads to a unique sparse pattern, the Grid pattern.\nSimultaneously, VLMs exhibit markedly different sparse distributions across\ndifferent modalities.

HEMA combines Compact Memory - a continuously updated one-sentence\nsummary preserving global narrative coherence, and Vector Memory - an episodic\nstore of chunk embeddings queried via cosine similarity. When integrated with a\n6B-parameter transformer, HEMA maintains coherent dialogues beyond 300 turns\nwhile keeping prompt length under 3,500 tokens. Experimental results show\nsubstantial improvements: factual recall accuracy increases from 41% to 87%,\nand human-rated coherence improves from 2.7 to 4.3 on a 5-point scale. With 10K\nindexed chunks, Vector Memory achieves P@5 >= 0.80 and R@50 >= 0.74, doubling\nthe area under the precision-recall curve compared to summarization-only\napproaches. Ablation studies reveal two key insights: semantic forgetting\nthrough age-weighted pruning reduces retrieval latency by 34% with minimal\nrecall loss, and a two-level summary hierarchy prevents cascade errors in\nultra-long conversations exceeding 1,000 turns. HEMA demonstrates that\ncombining verbatim recall with semantic continuity provides a practical\nsolution for privacy-aware conversational AI capable of month-long dialogues\nwithout model retraining.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-23T14:27:12Z"}

Given a\nsource vertex s, Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest path lengths from s\nto all other vertices in O(m + n log n) time. This bound is known to be\nworst-case optimal via a reduction to sorting. Theoretical computer science has\ndeveloped numerous fine-grained frameworks for analyzing algorithmic\nperformance beyond standard worst-case analysis, such as instance optimality\nand output sensitivity. Haeupler et al. [FOCS '24] consider the notion of\nuniversal optimality, a refined complexity measure that accounts for both the\ngraph topology and the edge weights. For a fixed graph topology, the universal\nrunning time of a weighted graph algorithm is defined as its worst-case running\ntime over all possible edge weightings of G. An algorithm is universally\noptimal if no other algorithm achieves a better asymptotic universal running\ntime on any particular graph topology. They show that Dijkstra's algorithm can\nbe made universally optimal by replacing the heap with a custom data structure.\n  We revisit their result. We introduce a simple heap property called timestamp\noptimality, where the cost of popping an element x is logarithmic in the number\nof elements inserted between pushing and popping x. We show that timestamp\noptimal heaps are not only easier to define but also easier to implement. Using\nthese timestamps, we provide a significantly simpler proof that Dijkstra's\nalgorithm, with the right kind of heap, is universally optimal.","main_category":"cs.DS","categories":"cs.DS","published":"2025-04-24T07:40:44Z"}

We assume that the $n$ vertices\nof the graph are partitioned among $k$ players, who execute a distributed\nalgorithm and communicate via message passing. An adaptive adversary may\nperform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges\nbetween the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by\nadapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate\nmaximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the\nalgorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for\nupdating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of\nsingle-edge insertions and deletions, we obtain the following results:\n  We give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O(\n\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\beta k} )$ rounds that maintains a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate\nmaximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges of the\ngraph.

It aims to synthesize images tailored to\nindividual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances,\nlayout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by\nleveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite\nnotable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large\nlanguage models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately\ncapture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular,\nthe state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual\nfeatures, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to\npreserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image\ngeneration framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation\nComposition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic\nintentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form\nuser-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs.\nSpecifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement\nlearning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style\nand semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with\ndifficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which\napplies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled\nrepresentations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on\ntwo benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while\neffectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance\nof disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective\npersonalized image generation.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.IR","published":"2025-04-24T08:10:10Z"}

It uses multiple decodings in different\nsubcodes, ensuring that the selected subcodes jointly cover the original code.\nWe extend ScED to polar codes by expressing polar subcodes through suitable\npre-transformations (PTs). To this end, we describe a framework classifying\npre-transformations for pre-transformed polar codes based on their role in\nencoding and decoding. Within this framework, we propose a new type of PT\nenabling ScED for polar codes, analyze its properties, and discuss how to\nconstruct an efficient ensemble.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,math.IT","published":"2025-04-24T12:55:23Z"}

The activations are used to derive a control\nvector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention,\nmodulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on\nthe specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and\nanalyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on\nreasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit\ndistribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply\ncontrol vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an\ninductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM\ncan, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning\nability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the\nability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a\ntask. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the\nsame manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and\ndemonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via\na simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-28T04:58:43Z"}

A scientific understanding of representation learning\nis critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is\nproducing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is\nimperative for further progress.\n  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite\ndifferently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for\nanalyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context.

We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more\nuniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts,\nanalyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of\n$\\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a\nbenchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with\nmodels from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the\nHarness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall\nperformance. Specifically, DiSF saves 98.5% of 590M training files in\nSlimPajama, outperforming the full-data pre-training within a 50B training\nbudget, and achieving about 1.5x training efficiency and 5x data efficiency.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-29T11:13:18Z"}

Traditional convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based methods struggle with capturing global features, while\nTransformers-based methods, despite effectively capturing global context,\nencounter high computational costs in 3D medical image segmentation. The Mamba\nmodel combines linear scalability with long-distance modeling, making it a\npromising approach for visual representation learning. However, Mamba-based 3D\nmulti-modal segmentation still struggles to leverage modality-specific features\nand fuse complementary information effectively. In this paper, we propose a\nMamba based feature extraction and adaptive multilevel feature fusion for 3D\ntumor segmentation using multi-modal medical image. We first develop the\nspecific modality Mamba encoder to efficiently extract long-range relevant\nfeatures that represent anatomical and pathological structures present in each\nmodality. Moreover, we design an bi-level synergistic integration block that\ndynamically merges multi-modal and multi-level complementary features by the\nmodality attention and channel attention learning. Lastly, the decoder combines\ndeep semantic information with fine-grained details to generate the tumor\nsegmentation map. Experimental results on medical image datasets (PET/CT and\nMRI multi-sequence) show that our approach achieve competitive performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based approaches.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-30T03:29:55Z"}

We formulate a\nlatency minimization problem under fidelity and detectability constraints to\nensure confidential and covert communication by jointly optimizing the transmit\npower and prompt compression ratio. To solve this problem, we first propose a\nprompt compression and encryption (PCAE) framework, performing surprisal-guided\ncompression followed by lightweight permutation-based encryption. Specifically,\nPCAE employs a locally deployed small language model (SLM) to estimate\ntoken-level surprisal scores, selectively retaining semantically critical\ntokens while discarding redundant ones. This significantly reduces\ncomputational overhead and transmission duration. To further enhance covert\nwireless transmission, we then develop a group-based proximal policy\noptimization (GPPO) method that samples multiple candidate actions for each\nstate, selecting the optimal one within each group and incorporating a\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to improve policy stability and\nexploration. Simulation results show that PCAE achieves comparable LLM response\nfidelity to baseline methods while reducing preprocessing latency by over five\norders of magnitude, enabling real-time edge deployment. We further validate\nPCAE effectiveness across diverse LLM backbones, including DeepSeek-32B,\nQwen-32B, and their smaller variants. Moreover, GPPO reduces covert\ntransmission latency by up to 38.6\\% compared to existing reinforcement\nlearning strategies, with further analysis showing that increased transmit\npower provides additional latency benefits.","main_category":"cs.NI","categories":"cs.NI","published":"2025-04-30T04:53:11Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00528v1","title":"An Analytic Zeta Function Ramp at the Black Hole Thouless Time","summary":"Black hole normal modes have intriguing connections to logarithmic spectra,\nand the spectral form factor (SFF) of $E_n = \\log n$ is the mod square of the\nRiemann zeta function (RZF). In this paper, we first provide an analytic\nunderstanding of the dip-ramp-plateau structure of RZF and show that the ramp\nat $\\beta \\equiv \\Re(s)=0$ has a slope precisely equal to 1. The $s=1$ pole of\nRZF can be viewed as due to a Hagedorn transition in this setting, and\nRiemann's analytic continuation to $\\Re(s)< 1$ provides the quantum\ncontribution to the truncated $\\log n$ partition function. This perspective\nyields a precise definition of RZF as the ''full ramp after removal of the\ndip'', and allows an unambiguous determination of the Thouless time. For black\nhole microstates, the Thouless time is expected to be\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$--remarkably, the RZF also exhibits this behavior. To our\nknowledge, this is the first black hole-inspired toy model that has a\ndemonstrably $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Thouless time. In contrast, it is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ in the SYK model and expected to be $\\mathcal{O}(N^{\\#})$\nin supergravity fuzzballs. We trace the origins of the ramp to a certain\nreflection property of the functional equation satisfied by RZF, and suggest\nthat it is a general feature of $L$-functions--we find evidence for ramps in\nlarge classes of $L$-functions. As an aside, we also provide an analytic\ndetermination of the slopes of (non-linear) ramps that arise in power law\nspectra using Poisson resummation techniques.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th","published":"2025-05-01T13:54:37Z"}

However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular\nmultivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and\nmissing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series\nasynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with\ntraditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an\nadaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to\nobservation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby\nenhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by\nincorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT\nefficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of\ninter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by\n11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art\nmethods.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-05-01T15:24:48Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00663v1","title":"Wasserstein Policy Optimization","summary":"We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm\nfor reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as\nan approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies\nprojected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a\nneural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.\nThe resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic\npolicy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits\nknowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the\naction. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies\nwith arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the\nreparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a\nmagnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art\ncontinuous control methods.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI","published":"2025-05-01T17:07:01Z"}

In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel\nreasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a\nbi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT\nthat can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the\nsemantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the\ntoken-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch\ngeneration. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce\nBiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes\nboth generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning\nstrategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance\nwith 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE\nbenchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.
