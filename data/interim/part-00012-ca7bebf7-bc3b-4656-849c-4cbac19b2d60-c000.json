This work systematically explores\nthe duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and\nGalilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical\nactions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of\nmotion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with\nelectric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond\nto both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic\nunderpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,\nrevealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean\nalgebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric\nframework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime\ngeometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and\nultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity\nand exotic condensed matter systems.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el,gr-qc","published":"2025-03-27T16:24:08Z"}

In\norder to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the\nconstruction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods\nfor constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks:\nthey are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison\nof the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in\norder to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-03-27T16:33:52Z"}

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23929v1","title":"Dynamical Networking using Gaussian fields","summary":"A novel field theoretical approach towards modelling dynamic networking in\ncomplex systems is presented. An equilibrium networking formalism which\nutilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can\nbind and unbind from one another. Here, \\textit{networking} refers to the\nintroduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not\nnecessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By\ncombining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a\nweighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The\nnetworking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the\nLangevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible\nconfigurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple\nexample of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another\ndemonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in\na collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the\ndynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average\nnumber of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for\neach type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is\nintroduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above\na minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate\nthat this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied\nto a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical\npredictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-03-31T10:25:26Z"}

TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate\nphoto-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. Using nine-band photometric data\nfrom the GAMA project, we assess the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z\nestimates to available spectroscopic redshifts. We generate synthetic galaxy\nspectra using the CIGALE software and run template set optimisation. We improve\nthe photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections.

The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the\nspectroscopic redshifts. We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various\nmagnitude bins and test how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the\nactual uncertainty of the estimates. We show that the TOPz results are\nconsistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes applied to the same\ndata set.

From the perspective of\npremerger electromagnetic emissions and next-generation gravitational-wave\ndetectors, gravity ($g-$) modes constitute a propitious class. However,\nexisting estimates for their impact employ linear schemes which may be\ninaccurate for large amplitudes, as achieved by tidal resonances. With\nrotation, inertial modes can be excited as well and while their non-linear\nsaturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial\nmodes, especially in the neutron-star context, is an open problem. We study the\nlinear and non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes and investigate the\nastrophysical consequences for binary neutron-star mergers, including the\npossibility of resonance-induced dynamo activity. A new (non-)linear\nformulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is\ndeveloped.

However, traditional CFPNs still suffer from two core\nlimitations: (1) a computational bottleneck caused by complex feature weighting\noperations, and (2) degraded boundary accuracy due to feature blurring in the\nupsampling process. To address these challenges, we propose CFMD, a novel\ncross-layer feature pyramid network that introduces two key innovations. First,\nwe design a context-aware feature aggregation module (CFLMA), which\nincorporates the state-of-the-art Mamba architecture to construct a dynamic\nweight distribution mechanism. This module adaptively adjusts feature\nimportance based on image context, significantly improving both representation\nefficiency and generalization. Second, we introduce an adaptive dynamic\nupsampling unit (CFLMD) that preserves spatial details during resolution\nrecovery. By adjusting the upsampling range dynamically and initializing with a\nbilinear strategy, the module effectively reduces feature overlap and maintains\nfine-grained boundary structures. Extensive experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD\nachieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary\nsegmentation quality, especially in complex scenes. The results validate the\neffectiveness of CFMD in jointly enhancing computational efficiency and\nsegmentation performance, highlighting its strong potential in salient object\ndetection tasks.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-02T03:22:36Z"}

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR,cs.AI,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-02T06:40:09Z"}

The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we\nexplain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition\nfunction of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and\nnormalizing. In contrast, we show that a larger universal family of highest\nweight modules, the higher order Verma modules, do not have discretely\nlog-concave characters. Finally, we extend all of these results to parabolic\n(i.e. \"first order\") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie\nalgebras $\\oplus_{t=1}^T \\mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\\mathbb{C})$.","main_category":"math.RT","categories":"math.RT,math.CO","published":"2025-04-02T11:30:23Z"}

While these models have shown success in predicting single\nobservables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the\nfull reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear. We extend history-based\nrecursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting\nPINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii)\nmulti-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation\nparameters (PMR-PINN). These models are applied to the spin-boson (SB) model\nand the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results show that SR-PINN and\nPSR-PINN, constrained by a narrow history window, fail to capture complex\nquantum evolution, leading to unstable long-term predictions, especially in\nnonlinear and highly correlated dynamics.

However, despite their stellar progenitors, SGRBs are often found\noutside the stellar light of the host galaxy. This is commonly attributed to\nsupernova kicks, which displace the SGRB progenitors from the original stellar\npopulation. Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce\nand interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using\nrealistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the\nhost galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis,\nand simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the\nBPASS code using three different kick prescriptions. We compare predicted and\nobserved offsets to investigate the impact of velocity kicks, host galaxy\ntypes, and host association criteria. The results confirm that the locations of\nthe SGRB population are consistent with the expectations of kicked BNS or BHNS\nprogenitors, implying that such mergers are the dominant (if not only)\nprogenitor system. Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit\ncompared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing\ndifferent kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement\nwhen including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%,\nwhile lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets. We argue that\nPch is biased against viable hosts at the largest offsets, and suggest the use\nof less conservative Pch thresholds for late-type hosts. For early-type hosts,\nthe predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch\nthreshold applied. We argue that this is likely due to the models missing\ngalaxy evolution, or spurious host associations.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA","published":"2025-04-07T08:31:12Z"}

In this paper, we address this\nproblem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish\nthemselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited\nfleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the\nfleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and\nin turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each\narea.

The additional energy loss due to NMM\ncan significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the\nMESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in\nlow-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He\ncore mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical\n$Z = 1 Z_{\\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$, and $\\mu_v = 3 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\\sim 5\\%$, and the TRGB\nluminosity increases by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However,\ncontrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs\nearlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the\nadditional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core,\nreleases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the\nhydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass\nfaster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak\nluminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and\nsub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency.\nWe found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash\ncan induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot\nregion into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in\nNMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter\nthe surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment\neffect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW\nmixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to\neffectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-08T04:33:18Z"}

We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed\nat $z\\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared\nto estimates at $z<15$, implying a significant tension with existing\ntheoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\\text{UV}}<-21$)\ncandidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In\nturn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude\nthat future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select\n$M_{\\text{UV}}\\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z>15$. Observations in the F150W and\nF200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also\nrequired to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z$\\lesssim$8.","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO","published":"2025-04-08T10:42:35Z"}

Although\nthis standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental\ndata, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics,\npostulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e.,\nindividual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers\nthis contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical\nquestion rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical\nstrongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on\none-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation\nof STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a\ntheoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going\nbeyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show\nwhy, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with\nexperimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and\nTersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate\ninterpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe\nthe process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of\nmany-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states. This can be\naccomplished by the concept of so-called Dyson orbitals.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el","published":"2025-04-08T10:45:59Z"}

The method constructs a\nreduced-order model (ROM) of the solution residual using intermediate solutions\nand periodically solves a least-square problem in the low-dimensional ROM\nsubspace. The second-order approximation of the residual and the use of normal\nequation distinguish this work from similar approaches in the literature from\nthe methodology perspective. From the application perspective, in contrast to\nprior studies that focus on linear systems or idealized problems, we rigorously\nassess the method's performance on realistic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\napplications. In addition to reducing the time complexity of point-iterative\nsolvers for linear systems, we demonstrate substantial reductions in the number\nof pseudo-time steps required for implicit schemes solving the nonlinear\nNavier-Stokes equations. Across a range of two- and three-dimensional\nflows-including subsonic inviscid and transonic turbulent cases-the method\nconsistently achieves a 3 to 4 times speedup in wall-clock time. Lastly, the\nproposed method acts as a robust stabilizer, capable of converging to steady\nsolutions in flows that would otherwise exhibit persistent unsteadiness-such as\nvortex shedding or transonic buffet-without relying on symmetry boundary\nconditions.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn,physics.comp-ph","published":"2025-04-08T13:53:04Z"}

From similarity-based selection to niche\npreservation, the general goal is to avoid premature convergence by not having\nfitness pressure as the single evolutionary force. In a way, such methods can\nresemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally\nassuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating\nPreferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing\npromising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method\nmimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences\nrather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such,\nPIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially\ntaking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness\npressure. However, it is still unclear how mating preferences affect the\noverall population and how dependent they are on set-up choices. In this work,\nwe tracked the evolution of individual preferences through different mutation\ntypes, searching for patterns and evidence of self-reinforcement.

In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks\nmay not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their\napplicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy\nfor the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's partial progress\nin the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a\nparallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in\nparallel with the same attention cache, with \"instant\" access to each other's\ngenerated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position\nEmbeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware\nutilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference\nwith shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-08T17:59:41Z"}

However, the security against spoofing\nattacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can\nmaliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate\nspeech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation\nof the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending\nagainst spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and\n(2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the\nlocal, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc\nembeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original\nmeaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the\ngeneration of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes.\nExperiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against\nremoval attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment\nreversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark\ndetectability.

This makes it roughly where\ndomain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is\npresent. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the\nregions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature\nextraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove\nthe low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific\ninformation such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However,\nsince low-frequency components also contain important information such as\ncolor, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from\n0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential\ninformation. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features. In\nexperiments, GTA5 (synthetic dataset) was used as training images, and a\nreal-world dataset was used for evaluation, and the proposed method\noutperformed conventional approaches. Similarly, in experiments that the\nCityscapes (real-world dataset) was used for training and various environment\ndatasets such as rain and nighttime were used for evaluation, the proposed\nmethod demonstrated its robustness under nighttime conditions.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-09T11:10:29Z"}

However, because the traces of different\nforgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included\nin the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we\npresent an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL).

We prove that any such\nmetric $g$ forces the universal cover $(\\tM, \\tg)$ to split isometrically as a\nRiemannian product $(\\Hyp, g_0) \\times (\\R, c^2 du^2)$, where $(\\Hyp, g_0)$ is\nthe hyperbolic plane equipped with a complete $\\pi_1(\\Sigma)$-invariant metric\nand $c>0$ is a constant. This affirmatively resolves the question and extends\nrigidity theorems known for flat tori and manifolds of non-positive curvature.\nWe present two proofs: the main proof relies on the analysis of Busemann\nfunctions associated with the lifted $S^1$-action, while an alternative proof\nutilizes Jacobi field analysis along the flow lines of the corresponding\nKilling field. Both approaches show that the absence of conjugate points\ncompels the horizontal distribution orthogonal to the Killing field flow to be\nparallel and integrable, leading to a global isometric splitting via the de\nRham theorem. Several geometric and dynamical consequences follow from this\nrigid structure.","main_category":"math.DG","categories":"math.DG","published":"2025-04-10T10:05:48Z"}

Against the backdrop of the conflicting positions of the\n'computational' and 'meat' chauvinisms, we ask: can the conceptual\nconstellation of the computational and AI be applied to the human domain and\nwhat does it mean to do so? What is one doing when the conceptual\nconstellations of AI in particular are used in this fashion? Rooted in a\nWittgensteinian view of concepts and language-use, we consider two possible\nanswers and pit them against each other: either these examples are conceptual\nmetaphors, or they are attempts at conceptual engineering.

By combining\nhigh-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover\na quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger\nlength prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for\ndesigning viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and\noffer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning,\nemulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft,physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-15T09:45:51Z"}

Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online\ntraining. However, two main challenges prevent this: hyperparameter selection,\nwhich is typically done by offline grid search, and training of the output\nlinear layer, which is memory-intensive. This paper introduces a fast and\naccurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing\nbackpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A\ntruncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption\nassociated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining\naccuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid\nsearch. Additionally, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D\nCholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4. These\nmethods enable the realization of an online edge training and inference system\nof DFR on an FPGA, reducing computation time by about 1/13 and power\nconsumption by about 1/27 compared to software implementation on the same\nboard.","main_category":"cs.AR","categories":"cs.AR","published":"2025-04-16T11:03:56Z"}

Online source-free UDA has emerged\nas a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted\nand target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world\nnature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts\nmeaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free\nuniversal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing\nmethods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship\nbetween pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To\nbridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled\nexperiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into\npseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap\nbetween the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved\nwith perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables\neffective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a\ncross-entropy loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves\nsuperior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our\nfindings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than\nquantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels\nis beneficial. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of\npseudo-labeling in (online) SF-UniDA and provides actionable insights to drive\nfuture advancements in the field.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel image signal processing (ISP) driven data synthesis pipeline\nthat addresses these challenges by generating unlimited paired training data.\nSpecifically, our pipeline begins with easily collected high-quality\nnormal-light images, which are first unprocessed into the RAW format using a\nreverse ISP. We then synthesize low-light degradations directly in the RAW\ndomain. The resulting data is subsequently processed through a series of ISP\nstages, including white balance adjustment, color space conversion, tone\nmapping, and gamma correction, with controlled variations introduced at each\nstage. This broadens the degradation space and enhances the diversity of the\ntraining data, enabling the generated data to capture a wide range of\ndegradations and the complexities inherent in the ISP pipeline. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our synthetic pipeline, we conduct extensive experiments\nusing a vanilla UNet model consisting solely of convolutional layers, group\nnormalization, GeLU activation, and convolutional block attention modules\n(CBAMs). Extensive testing across multiple datasets reveals that the vanilla\nUNet model trained with our data synthesis pipeline delivers high fidelity,\nvisually appealing enhancement results, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods both quantitatively and qualitatively.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.MM","published":"2025-04-16T15:53:53Z"}

Given that object information in\nimages plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background\ninformation, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream\nto selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these\ntasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning\nthat the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of\nthe encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant\ncomputations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional\nimage as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to\nzero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent\ncomputations as part of the image. To address such limitations, we propose an\nimage compression method based on a position-indexed self-attention mechanism\nthat encodes and decodes only the visible parts of the masked image. Compared\nto existing semantic-structured compression methods, our approach can\nsignificantly reduce computational costs.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-17T13:12:39Z"}

Such moments evoke intensely\nembodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a\nsudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult\nto articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily\nexperience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which\ncaptures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the\nbody. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite\nframework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up\nphysiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor\nactions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we\nargue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring,\nbut expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because\nthey rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily\nmaps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional\nexperience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies,\nand clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable.\nUltimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings\nthat elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words,\nyet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how\nemotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.","main_category":"q-bio.NC","categories":"q-bio.NC","published":"2025-04-21T05:26:05Z"}

Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard\nin SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector\neach, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous\nwork samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates\nall local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from\noptimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual\ntarget in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic\nissue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots\ncompetitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and\noff-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio\nare used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention\nmatching to further align local features of image and audio.

In our\nwork, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to\nreconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy\nemitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second\nchallenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and\ncan only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces\nan overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal\ncompletely.

Existing methods primarily\ntransfer traditional AF methods to encrypted tunnels directly, ignoring the\ncore obfuscation and re-encapsulation mechanism of encrypted tunnels, thus\nresulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose DecETT, a\ndual decouple-based semantic enhancement method for accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels. Specifically, DecETT improves AF under encrypted tunnels from two\nperspectives: app-specific feature enhancement and irrelevant tunnel feature\ndecoupling.Considering the obfuscated app-specific information in encrypted\ntunnel traffic, DecETT introduces TLS traffic with stronger app-specific\ninformation as a semantic anchor to guide and enhance the fingerprint\ngeneration for tunnel traffic. Furthermore, to address the app-irrelevant\ntunnel feature introduced by the re-encapsulation mechanism, DecETT is designed\nwith a dual decouple-based fingerprint enhancement module, which decouples the\ntunnel feature and app semantic feature from tunnel traffic separately, thereby\nminimizing the impact of tunnel features on accurate app fingerprint\nextraction.

However, the unique properties of hyperspectral data, such as high\ndimensionality and feature inlining, pose challenges to the application of\nMamba to HSI classification. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose\nan full-field interaction multi-groups Mamba framework (HS-Mamba), which adopts\na strategy different from pixel-patch based or whole-image based, but combines\nthe advantages of both. The patches cut from the whole image are sent to\nmulti-groups Mamba, combined with positional information to perceive local\ninline features in the spatial and spectral domains, and the whole image is\nsent to a lightweight attention module to enhance the global feature\nrepresentation ability. Specifically, HS-Mamba consists of a dual-channel\nspatial-spectral encoder (DCSS-encoder) module and a lightweight global inline\nattention (LGI-Att) branch. The DCSS-encoder module uses multiple groups of\nMamba to decouple and model the local features of dual-channel sequences with\nnon-overlapping patches. The LGI-Att branch uses a lightweight compressed and\nextended attention module to perceive the global features of the spatial and\nspectral domains of the unsegmented whole image.

This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two\nsignificant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental\ncombustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation\nand analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs\naffect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models?\nTo this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and\nderived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an\neffective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for\nRCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM\ntests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM\nautoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression\ntemperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber.\nFurthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can\nbe introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming\nideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical\nkinetic models.

This is the first\nobserved neutrino event with energy of the order of $\\mathcal{O}(100)$PeV, the\norigin of which remains unclear. We interprete this high energy neutrino event\nresults from the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\\chi$ decay through the\nright-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for\nneutrino masses and mixings. Fruthermore, dark matter $\\chi$ is assumed to\ncharged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is sponetaneously broken by\nthe vacuum expectation value of the dark Higgs $\\Phi$. In this scenario, the DM\ncan decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles for $v_\\Phi \\gg m_\\chi$,\nwhich we assume is the case. If the DM mass is around $440$ PeV with a lifetime\n$5\\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such\nheavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to\noverproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in\nproduction of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the\nDM dominantly in the early Universe. We have also found a set of allowed\nparameter values that can correctly account for the DM relic density and decay\nlifetime required to explain the KM3NeT signal. Moreover, we have generated the\nneutrino spectra from the two-body decay using the HDMSpectra package, which\nrequires the dark Higgs vacuum expectations value (VEV) to be much larger than\nthe DM mass. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the\npossibility of generating GW spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a\nreasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield\nthe correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and\nallow for possible detection of GW at future detectors.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph,astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-22T17:07:39Z"}

We present a\npreemption aware scheduling approach for priority and deadline constrained task\noffloading in homogeneous edge networks. Our scheduling approach consists of\ntwo distinct scheduling algorithms, designed to accommodate the differing\nrequirements of high and low priority tasks.

To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses\ndrive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish\nbetween compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical\nshortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot\ndistinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and\ncrack-parallel stresses that do not.\n  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our\nearlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel\nstresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic\nformulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past\neach other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces\ncontact under normal compressive loads. We compare our approach against two\nwidely used approaches, Spectral splitting and the Volumetric-Deviatoric\nsplitting, and find that these predict unphysical crack growth and unphysical\nstress concentrations under loading conditions in which these should not occur.\nSpecifically, we show that the splitting models predict spurious crack growth\nand stress concentration under pure crack-parallel normal stresses.

Belief formation takes place by means of an\niterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs\nby using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with\nthe beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can\nfail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to\nincorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where\nboth the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We\npropose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\\text{A}^2\\text{SL}$) strategy,\nwhich infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This\ngoal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient\ndescent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an\nadaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These\nstages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of\nthe error probability for each agent.

Instead of directly optimizing the parameters, DR-FWI optimizes\nthe network weights to reconstruct them, thereby embedding structural priors\nand facilitating optimization. To provide benchmark guidelines for the design\nof DR-FWI, we conduct a comparative analysis of three representative\narchitectures (U-Net, CNN, MLP) combined with two initial model embedding\nstrategies: one pretraining the network to generate predefined initial models\n(pretraining-based), while the other directly adds network outputs to the\ninitial models. Extensive ablation experiments show that combining CNN with\npretraining-based initialization significantly enhances inversion accuracy,\noffering valuable insights into network design. To further understand the\nmechanism of DR-FWI, spectral bias analysis reveals that the network first\ncaptures low-frequency features and gradually reconstructs high-frequency\ndetails, enabling an adaptive multi-scale inversion strategy.

We explore three scenarios to understand the system's\nmulti-wavelength emission -- (a) SN ejecta interacting with an extended\ncircumstellar medium (CSM), (b) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet\nchoked in its stellar envelope, and (c) the shocked cocoon of a\ncollapsar-driven jet choked in an extended CSM. All three models can explain\nthe optical light curve and are also consistent with the radio and X-ray\nobservations. We favor models (a) and (c) because they self-consistently\nexplain both the X-ray prompt emission and first optical peak, but we do not\nrule out model (b). From the properties of the first peak in models (a) and\n(c), we find evidence that EP250108a/SN 2025kg interacts with an extended CSM,\nand infer an envelope mass $M_{\\rm e} \\sim 0.1\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ and radius $R_{\\rm\ne} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{13}$ cm.

Due to dimensional variations,\nthere is a gap when two fuselage assemble. In practice, actuators are required\nto adjust fuselage dimensions by applying forces to specific points on fuselage\nedge through pulling or pushing force actions. The positioning and force\nsettings of these actuators significantly influence the efficiency of the shape\nadjustments. The current literature usually predetermines the fixed number of\nactuators, which is not optimal in terms of overall quality and corresponding\nactuator costs. However, optimal placement of actuators in terms of both\nlocations and number is challenging due to compliant structures, complex\nmaterial properties, and dimensional variabilities of incoming fuselages.
