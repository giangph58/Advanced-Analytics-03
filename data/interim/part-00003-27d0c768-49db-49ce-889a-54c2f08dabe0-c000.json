Here, we propose using\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\ndynamically tuned via light.

Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining.

Despite numerous discrete models for partially exchangeable\nobservations, a unifying framework is currently missing, leaving many questions\nabout the induced learning mechanisms unanswered in this setting. To fill this\ngap, we consider the natural extension of species sampling models to a\nmultivariate framework, obtaining a general class of models characterized by\ntheir partially exchangeable partition probability function. A notable\nsubclass, named regular multivariate species sampling models, exists among\nthese models. In the subclass, dependence across processes is accurately\ncaptured by the correlation among them: a correlation of one equals full\nexchangeability and a null correlation corresponds to independence. Regular\nmultivariate species sampling models encompass discrete processes for partial\nexchangeable data used in Bayesian models, thereby highlighting their core\ndistributional properties and providing a means for developing new models.","main_category":"math.ST","categories":"math.ST,stat.ME,stat.TH","published":"2025-03-31T12:30:54Z"}

In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify\nthe underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped\n$L$PO$_{4}$ series.

In this work, we present a novel, low-cost, high-DoF master\ncontroller based on Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), designed to overcome\nthese limitations. The system decouples translation and orientation control,\nfollowing a scalable 3 + 3 + n DoF structure: 3 DoFs for large-range\ntranslation using a CDPR, 3 DoFs for orientation using a gimbal mechanism, and\nn additional DoFs for gripper and redundant joint control. Its lightweight\ncable-driven design enables a large and adaptable workspace while minimizing\nactuator load. The end-effector remains stable without requiring continuous\nhigh-torque input, unlike most serial robot arms. We developed the first\ndual-arm CDPR-based master controller using cost-effective actuators and a\nsimple mechanical structure. In demonstrations, the system successfully\ncontrolled an 8-DoF robotic arm with a 2-DoF pan-tilt camera, performing tasks\nsuch as pick-and-place, knot tying, object sorting, and tape application. The\nresults show precise, versatile, and practical high-DoF teleoperation.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-04-02T09:54:16Z"}

However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural\nnetworks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in\nerroneous or malicious outputs. While existing efforts utilize adversarial\nfine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance\ndegradation on clean inputs.

The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate\nlong-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in\nlarge motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes\na novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion\nestimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions.\nSpecifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and\nnon-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large\nmotions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to\nestimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction\nmodule that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the\naccuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference\nframes during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training.\nExperiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets\nunder random access configuration.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.MM","published":"2025-04-03T13:15:45Z"}

Although complete in their ability\nto describe all stabilizing controllers, methods based on nonlinear Youla and\nsystem-level synthesis are significantly affected by the difficulty of\nparameterizing Lp-stable operators. In contrast, MAD policies introduce\nexplicit feedback on state-dependent features - a key element behind the\nsuccess of RL pipelines - without compromising closed-loop stability. This is\nachieved by describing the magnitude of the control input with a\ndisturbance-feedback Lp-stable operator, while selecting its direction based on\nstate-dependent features through a universal function approximator. We further\ncharacterize the robust stability properties of MAD policies under model\nmismatch. Unlike existing disturbance-feedback policy parameterizations, MAD\npolicies introduce state-feedback components compatible with model-free RL\npipelines, ensuring closed-loop stability without requiring model information\nbeyond open-loop stability.

Over their lifetime, this escape\nvaries significantly, making evolution studies essential for interpreting the\ngrowing number of observations of escaping planetary atmospheres. In a previous\nwork, we modelled this evolving escape, alongside one of its observable\ntracers, the helium triplet transit signature at 1083nm. Using hydrodynamic and\nray-tracing models, we demonstrated that atmospheric escape and the\ncorresponding He 1083nm signature are stronger at younger ages, for a\n0.3$~M_\\text{J}$ gas-giant. Yet, the current literature includes several young\n(<1Gyr) planets with weak or non-detections in He 1083nm.

From our two studies, we conclude that for any given planet,\nstronger atmospheric escape during younger ages produces deeper He 1083nm\nabsorption. However, for a population of exoplanets, the relation between\nyounger ages and stronger He absorptions is lost to the broad diversity of\ntheir various other system parameters.

Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra:\nit enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a\ncontinuous redshift range $4\\lesssim z\\lesssim 7$, as well as measurements of\nthe intrinsic Lyman-$\\beta$ opacity. Our novel constraints are in good\nagreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\nobservations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST $z>5$ galaxy\nspectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the\nuncontaminated Lyman-$\\beta$ opacity at $5<z<6$. Finally, we demonstrate the\npower of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of\nreionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously\nreported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters detected\nwith JWST in GOODS-South at $z=5.8-5.9$ coincides with an anomalously low IGM\nopacity to Lyman-$\\alpha$ at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate\nexcess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of\n$M_{\\rm{UV}}\\lesssim -10$ galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have\n$\\log_{10}\\langle \\xi_{\\rm{ion}} f_{\\rm{esc}} / \\ [\\rm{erg}^{-1}\\rm{Hz}]\\rangle\n= 24.7$ (or equivalently $\\log_{10}\\xi_{\\rm{ion}} / \\\n[\\rm{erg}^{-1}\\rm{Hz}]=25.4$ and $f_{\\rm{esc}}=20\\%$).

However, traditional\nexperimental methods are time-consuming and costly, and existing computational\nmodels face challenges in cross-modal feature fusion, robustness, and\nfalse-negative suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised\ncontrastive multimodal framework, SCMPPI, for PPI prediction. By integrating\nprotein sequence features (AAC, DPC, CKSAAP-ESMC) with PPI network topology\ninformation (Node2Vec graph embedding), and combining an improved supervised\ncontrastive learning strategy, SCMPPI significantly enhances PPI prediction\nperformance. For the PPI task, SCMPPI introduces a negative sample filtering\nmechanism and modifies the contrastive loss function, effectively optimizing\nmultimodal features. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including yeast,\nhuman, and H.pylori, show that SCMPPI outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods (such as DF-PPI and TAGPPI) in key metrics such as accuracy ( 98.01%)\nand AUC (99.62%), and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-species\nprediction (AUC > 99% on multi-species datasets). Furthermore, SCMPPI has been\nsuccessfully applied to CD9 networks, the Wnt pathway, and cancer-specific\nnetworks, providing a reliable tool for disease target discovery.

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in a\nvariety of plasma technologies, including Hall thrusters, where azimuthal\ninstabilities significantly influence electron confinement and, hence, device\nperformance. While the impact of prominent plasma instabilities, such as the\nelectron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream\ninstability (MTSI) on cross-field transport of electron species is well\nrecognized and widely studied, strategies for actively manipulating these\ndynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the effect of\ntargeted wave excitation on instability evolution and electron transport using\none- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of representative plasma\ndischarge configurations. A time-varying electric field is applied axially to\nmodulate the spectral energy distribution of the instabilities across a range\nof forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Our results reveal that the so-called\n\"unsteady forcing\" can both suppress and amplify instability modes depending on\nexcitation parameters. In particular, across both 1D and 2D simulation\nconfigurations, forcing near 40 MHz effectively reduces ECDI amplitude and\ndecreases axial electron transport by about 30%, while high-frequency\nexcitation near the electron cyclotron frequency induces spectral broadening,\ninverse energy cascades, and enhanced transport.

We perform our analysis using 8-bit quantized and\ninstruction-tuned versions of Llama 3.1 (8B), Phi-3, and Mistral 7B. Our\nresults indicate that, for tasks involving short contexts, augmenting the\nprompt with the AMR of the original language context often degrades the\nperformance of the underlying LLM. However, for tasks that involve long\ncontexts, such as dialogue summarization in the SAMSum dataset, this\nenhancement improves LLM performance, for example, by increasing the zero-shot\ncosine similarity score of Llama 3.1 from 66.2% to 76%. This improvement is\nmore evident in the newer and larger LLMs, but does not extend to the older or\nsmaller ones. In addition, we observe that LLMs can effectively reconstruct the\noriginal text from a linearized AMR, achieving a cosine similarity of 81.3% in\nthe best-case scenario.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-04-07T05:38:40Z"}

In the PDSs of\nthe LHS and HIMS, the broad-band noises are well fitted with three Lorentzian\ncomponents: a low-frequency component $L_1$, a middle-frequency component $L_2$\nand a high-frequency component $L_3$.

The\nappearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced\nnon-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair.

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the\nuse of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering\nfunctionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss\ncoefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system. Circuit modelling and\nelectromagnetic (EM) simulations were conducted to ensure alignment between\ntheoretical and practical results. The design demonstrates effective unequal\npower division at the three output ports while maintaining very good filtering\nperformance. Results show a return loss better than 15 dB and a minimum\ninsertion loss of 1.2 dB. The overall size of the device is 32.2 x 50.0 mm.\nThis paper contributes to advancements in power divider design by addressing\nunequal power division challenges and integrating filtering functions.

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for\nprecise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred\nintermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation.

An RF-SET (radio-frequency single electron\ntransistor) is predominantly used as its the readout timescale is far shorter\nthan the spin decoherence time. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a\ntransmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor\nassembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot\nin a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium\ninductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF\nreflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need\nfor directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot\ncharge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of\nRF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is\nfound to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration\ntimes are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry\nset-ups.

The black box nature of these models makes understanding\ntheir prediction process difficult. This issue is crucial because CNNs are\nprone to learning shortcuts and biases, compromising their robustness and\nalignment with human expectations. To assess whether such mechanisms are being\nused and the associated risk, it is essential to provide model explanations\nthat reflect the inner workings of the model. Concept Extraction (CE) methods\noffer such explanations, but have mostly been developed for the image domain so\nfar, leaving a gap in the time series domain. In this work, we present a CE and\nlocalization method tailored to the time series domain, based on the ideas of\nCE methods for images. We propose the novel method ECLAD-ts, which provides\npost-hoc global explanations based on how the models encode subsets of the\ninput at different levels of abstraction. For this, concepts are produced by\nclustering timestep-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps, and their\nimportance is computed based on their impact on the prediction process.

To\naddress these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned\nLatent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a\n3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module\n(LFM). SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating\nfeatures from both images and point clouds across multiple levels. SAM is\ndesigned to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point\nclouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features.\nAdditionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space\nwithout utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating\ncomputational complexity. Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets\ndemonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our\napproach obtains an absolute gain of 2.15% in 3D AP, compared with the\nstate-of-art method GraphAlign on the moderate level of the KITTI test set.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-07T15:15:06Z"}

The geometric properties of\nhyperbolic space offer a promising solution to address this issue.\nNevertheless, integrating LLMs-based methods with hyperbolic space to\neffectively extract and incorporate diverse hierarchical information is\nnon-trivial. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named\nHyperLLM, which extracts and integrates hierarchical information from both\nstructural and semantic perspectives.

Then, tag-item and user-item interactions are\njointly learned and aligned through contrastive learning, thereby providing the\nmodel with clear hierarchical information. Semantically, HyperLLM introduces a\nnovel meta-optimized strategy to extract hierarchical information from semantic\nembeddings and bridge the gap between the semantic and collaborative spaces for\nseamless integration. Extensive experiments show that HyperLLM significantly\noutperforms recommender systems based on hyperbolic space and LLMs, achieving\nperformance improvements of over 40%.

Among various guidance strategies presented in literature,\nlook-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant\nattention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low\ncross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded\nlateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes\nproblematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce\nhigher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high\nvariation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of\nlook-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance\nstrategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized\n$L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference\npath in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the\nvehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of\ncorrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to\ngenerate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root\nmean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance\nstrategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the\nconventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and\nmeasures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration\nrequirements.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-04-08T12:31:19Z"}

First, people respond positively to improvements in\nchatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently\nthan expected-time minimization would predict.

We first design a deep and rule-based interleaving\nalgorithm based on Transformer network to perform spectrum sensing and signal\nrecovery under sub-Nyquist sampling rate, and second, cascade protocol\nidentifier and decoder based on Transformer neural networks to help physical\nlayer packets analysis. We implement SigChord using software-defined radio\nplatforms, and extensively evaluate it on over-the-air terrestrial and\nnon-terrestrial wireless signals.

However, previous works have primarily focused on\ntwo-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather\nthan pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative\ninvestments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear\npublic goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the\ncooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating\nbenefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit\nfunction, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the\nthreshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For\nintermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies\ncan coexist.

While existing methods rely on multi-frame image sequences to\nidentify moving objects, single-image MOS is critical for applications like\nmotion intention prediction and handling camera frame drops. However,\nsegmenting moving objects from a single image remains challenging for existing\nmethods due to the absence of temporal cues. To address this gap, we propose\nMovSAM, the first framework for single-image moving object segmentation. MovSAM\nleverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enhanced with\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to search the moving object and generate text\nprompts based on deep thinking for segmentation. These prompts are cross-fused\nwith visual features from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a\nVision-Language Model (VLM), enabling logic-driven moving object segmentation.\nThe segmentation results then undergo a deep thinking refinement loop, allowing\nMovSAM to iteratively improve its understanding of the scene context and\ninter-object relationships with logical reasoning. This innovative approach\nenables MovSAM to segment moving objects in single images by considering scene\nunderstanding. We implement MovSAM in the real world to validate its practical\napplication and effectiveness for autonomous driving scenarios where the\nmulti-frame methods fail. Furthermore, despite the inherent advantage of\nmulti-frame methods in utilizing temporal information, MovSAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across public MOS benchmarks, reaching 92.5\\% on\nJ\\&F.

This often leads to incorrect redshift assignments when\nrelying on a single emission line, due to noise spikes or contamination from\nnon-target emission lines, commonly referred to as redshift interlopers. We\npropose a machine learning approach to correct the impact of interlopers at the\nlevel of measured summary statistics, focusing on the power spectrum monopole\nand line interlopers as a proof of concept. To model interloper effects, we use\nhalo catalogs from the Quijote simulations as proxies for galaxies, displacing\na fraction of halos by the distance corresponding to the redshift offset\nbetween target and interloper galaxies. This yields contaminated catalogs with\nvarying interloper fractions across a wide range of cosmologies from the\nQuijote suite. We train a neural network on the power spectrum monopole, alone\nor combined with the bispectrum monopole, from contaminated mocks to estimate\nthe interloper fraction and reconstruct the cleaned power spectrum. We evaluate\nperformance in two settings: one with fixed cosmology and another where\ncosmological parameters vary under broad priors. In the fixed case, the network\nrecovers the interloper fraction and corrects the power spectrum to better than\n1% accuracy. When cosmology varies, performance degrades, but adding bispectrum\ninformation significantly improves results, reducing the interloper fraction\nerror by 40-60%.

Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling\nsequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.\nHowever, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel\nsampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates\ndiverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential\nsearch, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute\nbudget remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these\ntwo approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.\nSurprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on\nCountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not\nuniversally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to\ndegrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into\nsuboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage\n\"implicit\" (non-verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement\nlearning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit\nsignificantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see\nlimited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that\nbacktracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex\ninteraction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning\nparadigm.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T17:12:49Z"}

Going beyond final accuracy,\nwe propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output\nfrom language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks:\nunderstanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow\nfrom them. The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with\nthe goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs\nunderstand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can\nthey infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? Since existing benchmarks\nmay be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency\non novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. On novel grade school math\nproblems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of\ninput premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of\nreasoning hops is increased. Interestingly, these errors are masked in the\noriginal benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy. As we increase the\nnumber of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple\nhops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input\npremises. Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural\npropagation of early errors do not explain the trends.

They are appealing for developing fast\nreference libraries without double rounding issues. The key insight is to build\npolynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with\ntwo additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with\nthe \"non-standard\" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the\nRLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The\nresulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with\nmachine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding\nmode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest\nmode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the\nsystem's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded\nresult, and restores the application's rounding mode. This frequent change of\nrounding modes has a performance cost.\n  This paper proposes two new methods, which we call rounding-invariant outputs\nand rounding-invariant input bounds, to avoid the frequent changes to the\nrounding mode and the dependence on the round-to-nearest mode.

In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two\nelectromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of\nthe two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when\nlinear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the\ntotal polarization degree conserved.

On the other hand, Bayesian\nneural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic)\nuncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction\nmethod by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters.\nUnfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly\nquantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still\npersists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an\nexisting generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and\nintroduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian\nneural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by\nleveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be\neasily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated\nthe proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and\nimage inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric\nuncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the\ncharacteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.\nFurthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on\ntop of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent\nwith frequentist principles.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-10T12:30:46Z"}

While many voices\nhighlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to\nthe conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue\nthat technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful\nethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on\nDe Jong & De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I\nclarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I\ncontend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding\nof what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by\nextension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement\ncapacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts -\ntend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics.\nInstead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach:\nfostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis\nfor ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic\nrequirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for\nparticipation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical\nexpertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing\nnot only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph,quant-ph","published":"2025-04-10T12:38:45Z"}

Many previous SPH porous\nflow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid\ninterface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid\nand solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows\nus to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account\nand results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can\nsimulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid\nand solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit\nforces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces.

To mitigate such biases, prior studies have\nattempted to project model embeddings into unbiased spaces during inference.\nHowever, these approaches have shown limited effectiveness due to their weak\nalignment with downstream social biases. Inspired by the observation that\nconcept cognition in LLMs is primarily represented through a linear associative\nmemory mechanism, where key-value mapping occurs in the MLP layers, we posited\nthat biased concepts and social groups are similarly encoded as entity (key)\nand information (value) pairs, which can be manipulated to promote fairer\nassociations. To this end, we propose Fairness Mediator (FairMed), a bias\nmitigation framework that neutralizes stereotype associations. Our framework\ncomprises two main components: a stereotype association prober and an\nadversarial debiasing neutralizer. The prober captures stereotype associations\nencoded within MLP layer activations by employing prompts centered around\nbiased concepts to detect the emission probabilities for social groups.\nSubsequently, the adversarial debiasing neutralizer intervenes in MLP\nactivations during inference to equalize the association probabilities among\ndifferent social groups. Extensive experiments across nine protected attributes\nshow that FairMed significantly outperforms SOTA methods in effectiveness.\nCompared to the most effective baseline, FairMed presents competitive\nefficiency by cutting mitigation overhead by hundreds of minutes.

The proposed\nsurrogate-based method (often called Bayesian optimization) uses adaptive\nsampling to promote a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Our\nin-house implementation, called SEGOMOE, handles a high number of design\nvariables (continuous, discrete or categorical) and nonlinearities by combining\nmixtures of experts for the objective and/or the constraints. Additionally, the\nmethod handles multi-objective optimization settings, as it allows the\nconstruction of accurate Pareto fronts with a minimal number of function\nevaluations. Different infill criteria have been implemented to handle multiple\nobjectives with or without constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod was tested on practical aeronautical applications within the context of\nthe European Project AGILE 4.0 and demonstrated favorable results. A first\nexample concerns a retrofitting problem where a comparison between two\noptimizers have been made. A second example introduces hierarchical variables\nto deal with architecture system in order to design an aircraft family.

The discrete Boltzmann method\n(DBM) provides a multiscale kinetic modeling framework and analysis tool to\ncapture complex discrete/nonequilibrium effects. While the numerical scheme\nplays a fundamental role in DBM simulations, a comprehensive stability analysis\nremains lacking. Similar to LBM, the complexity mainly arises from the\nintrinsic coupling between velocity and spatiotemporal discretizations,\ncompared with CFD. This study applies von Neumann stability analysis to\ninvestigate key factors influencing DBM simulation stability, including\nphase-space discretization, thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) levels,\nspatiotemporal schemes, initial conditions, and model parameters. Key findings\ninclude: (i) the moment-matching approach outperforms expansion- and\nweighting-based methods in the test simulations; (ii) increased TNE enhances\nsystem nonlinearity and the intrinsic nonlinearity embedded in the model\nequations, amplifying instabilities; (iii) additional viscous dissipation based\non distribution functions improves stability but distorts flow fields and\nalters constitutive relations; (iv) larger CFL numbers and relative time steps\ndegrade stability, necessitating appropriate time-stepping strategies. To\nassess the stability regulation capability of DBMs across TNE levels,\nstability-phase diagrams and probability curves are constructed via\nmorphological analysis within the moment-matching framework. These diagrams\nidentify common stable parameter regions across model orders. This study\nreveals key factors and coupling mechanisms affecting DBM stability and\nproposes strategies for optimizing equilibrium distribution discretization,\nvelocity design, and parameter selection in supersonic regimes.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-14T13:04:58Z"}
