Since CCEs are generally\nbiased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for\nprobing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the\nFlashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with\nspectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar\nproperties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar\npopulation in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc\nand, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs,\ncalculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a\nSalpeter-like IMF ($\\alpha=2.35$) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by\na factor of ${\\sim}0.7$, and a top-heavy IMF ($\\alpha=1.00$) overpredicts by a\nfactor of ${\\sim}1.7$, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere\nin between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating\nthe stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent.\nNevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using\nCCEs.

This paper\nintroduces SparseFlex, a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that\nenables differentiable mesh reconstruction at resolutions up to $1024^3$\ndirectly from rendering losses. SparseFlex combines the accuracy of Flexicubes\nwith a sparse voxel structure, focusing computation on surface-adjacent regions\nand efficiently handling open surfaces.

We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot,\nthat uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic\nmanner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a \"double-forward pass\" training\nstrategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates\na bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of\nsummary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the\nlanguage instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct\nreplacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses:\nan autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct\noptimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after\nthe first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for\ndiscriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific\nadapters.

Among these factors, tinnitus patients commonly report drastic\nincreases of tinnitus loudness following nap sleep. Previous studies have\nsuggested that this clinical pattern could be attributed to a somatosensory\nmodulation of tinnitus. To our knowledge, no polysomnographic study has been\ncarried out to assess this hypothesis. Methods: For this observational\nprospective study, 37 participants reporting frequent increases of tinnitus\nfollowing naps were recruited. They participated to six full-polysomnography\nnap attempts over two days. Audiological and kinesiologic tests were conducted\nbefore and after each nap attempt. Results: 197 naps were collected. Each nap\nat each time of day elicited an overall significant increase in tinnitus\nminimum masking level (MML). Each inter nap period elicited an overall\nsignificant decrease.

However, most of the existing VL\ntrackers rely on carefully designed mechanisms to perform the multi-stage\nmulti-modal fusion. Additionally, direct multi-modal fusion without alignment\nignores distribution discrepancy between modalities in feature space,\npotentially leading to suboptimal representations. In this work, we propose\nCOST, a contrastive one-stage transformer fusion framework for VL tracking,\naiming to learn semantically consistent and unified VL representations.\nSpecifically, we introduce a contrastive alignment strategy that maximizes\nmutual information (MI) between a video and its corresponding language\ndescription. This enables effective cross-modal alignment, yielding\nsemantically consistent features in the representation space. By leveraging a\nvisual-linguistic transformer, we establish an efficient multi-modal fusion and\nreasoning mechanism, empirically demonstrating that a simple stack of\ntransformer encoders effectively enables unified VL representations. Moreover,\nwe contribute a newly collected VL tracking benchmark dataset for small object\ntracking, named VL-SOT500, with bounding boxes and language descriptions. Our\ndataset comprises two challenging subsets, VL-SOT230 and VL-SOT270, dedicated\nto evaluating generic and high-speed small object tracking, respectively.

As Docker\nusage grows, optimizing Dockerfile performance, particularly by reducing\nrebuild time, has become essential for maintaining efficient CI/CD pipelines.\nHowever, existing optimization approaches primarily address single builds\nwithout considering the recurring rebuild costs associated with modifications\nand evolution, limiting long-term efficiency gains. To bridge this gap, we\npresent Doctor, a method for improving Dockerfile build efficiency through\ninstruction re-ordering that addresses key challenges: identifying instruction\ndependencies, predicting future modifications, ensuring behavioral equivalence,\nand managing the optimization computational complexity. We developed a\ncomprehensive dependency taxonomy based on Dockerfile syntax and a historical\nmodification analysis to prioritize frequently modified instructions. Using a\nweighted topological sorting algorithm, Doctor optimizes instruction order to\nminimize future rebuild time while maintaining functionality.

This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine\nlearning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information\navailable in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive\nanalysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and\nutterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of\nstate-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature\nextraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion\ntechniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM)\npredictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron\nclassifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity\nprediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification\n(considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that\nutterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for\ntext and audio modalities.

The majority of existing core flow models are global,\nshowing features such as an eccentric planetary gyre, with some evidence of\nrapid regional changes. By construction, the flow defined at any location by\nsuch a model depends on all magnetic field variations across the entire\ncore-mantle boundary making it challenging to interpret local structures in the\nflow as due to specific local changes in magnetic field. Here we present an\nalternative strategy in which we construct regional flow models that rely only\non local secular changes. We use a novel technique based on machine learning\ntermed Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), in which we seek a regional\nflow model that simultaneously fits both the local magnetic field variation and\ndynamical conditions assumed satisfied by the flow.

We\nobserve that the standard system combination rule--the tensor product--was\nderived after the development of single-system complex quantum theory. By\nstarting from a single-system quantum theory using only real numbers, we derive\na combination rule that produces a real quantum theory with properties\nanalogous to those of conventional complex quantum theory.

However,\nchallenges such as scale variations and complex backgrounds significantly\nimpact the accuracy of crowd counting. To mitigate these issues, this paper\nproposes a robust Transformer-based crowd counting network, termed RCCFormer,\nspecifically designed for background suppression and scale awareness. The\nproposed method incorporates a Multi-level Feature Fusion Module (MFFM), which\nmeticulously integrates features extracted at diverse stages of the backbone\narchitecture. It establishes a strong baseline capable of capturing intricate\nand comprehensive feature representations, surpassing traditional baselines.\nFurthermore, the introduced Detail-Embedded Attention Block (DEAB) captures\ncontextual information and local details through global self-attention and\nlocal attention along with a learnable manner for efficient fusion. This\nenhances the model's ability to focus on foreground regions while effectively\nmitigating background noise interference. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive\nScale-Aware Module (ASAM), with our novel Input-dependent Deformable\nConvolution (IDConv) as its fundamental building block. This module dynamically\nadapts to changes in head target shapes and scales, significantly improving the\nnetwork's capability to accommodate large-scale variations.

We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a\nreversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding\ninfection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy\ntrait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate.

Given an event log, a process tree is obtained through a process\ndiscovery algorithm, i.e., a process tree that is aimed at reproducing, as\naccurately as possible, the language of the log. The process tree is then\ntransformed into a Petri net that generates the same set of sequences as the\nprocess tree. In order to capture the frequency of the sequences in the event\nlog, weights are assigned to the transitions of the Petri net, resulting in a\nstochastic Petri net with a stochastic language in which each sequence is\nassociated with a probability. In this paper we show that this procedure has\nunfavorable properties. First, the weights assigned to the transitions of the\nPetri net have an unclear role in the resulting stochastic language. We will\nshow that a weight can have multiple, ambiguous impact on the probability of\nthe sequences generated by the Petri net. Second, a number of different Petri\nnets with different number of transitions can correspond to the same process\ntree.

While useful for\nsingle subjects, we find that it struggles when scaling to multiple characters.\nIn this work, we first analyze the reason for these limitations. Our\nexploration reveals that the primary-issue stems from self-attention-leakage,\nwhich is exacerbated when trying to ensure consistency across\nmultiple-characters. This happens when tokens from one subject pay attention to\nother characters, causing them to appear like each other (e.g., a dog appearing\nlike a duck).

One way to quantify\nclass hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples\nrequired to effectively learn a given class. Sample complexity theory suggests\nthat class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for\ngeneralization. That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to\nachieve generalization. Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising\napproach to mitigate these performance disparities. While resampling has been\nstudied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced\ndatasets remains unexplored.\n  This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because\nit addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance. We begin addressing this\nquestion by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its\neffect on performance disparities. We oversample hard classes and undersample\neasy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity\nrequirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness. We\nestimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness\nestimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios. Using these ratios, we\nperform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets.\n  Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based\nresampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities. To\nexplain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key\nchallenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from\ntraditional data-based imbalance. Our insights help explain why theoretical\nsample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance\ngains and we provide guidelines for future research.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T16:45:57Z"}

However, obtaining paired\nimages in clinical practice is challenging. To address this issue, zero-shot\nself-supervised methods train denoising networks using only the information\nwithin a single image, such as ZS-N2N. However, these methods often employ\ndownsampling operations that degrade image resolution. Additionally, the\ntraining dataset is inherently constrained to the image itself. In this paper,\nwe propose a zero-shot low-dose CT imaging method based on sinogram flicking,\nwhich operates within a single image but generates many copies via random\nconjugate ray matching. Specifically, two conjugate X-ray pencil beams measure\nthe same path; their expected values should be identical, while their noise\nlevels vary during measurements.

Compressed sensing (CS) algorithms, such as the VAMP algorithm, are\nused for sparse signal processing in the sub-Nyquist radar framework. By\ncombining deep unfolding techniques with VAMP, faster convergence and higher\naccuracy than traditional CS algorithms are achieved. However, deep unfolding\ndisrupts the parameter constrains in traditional VAMP algorithm, leading to the\ndistribution of non-sparse noisy estimation in VAMP deep unfolding unknown, and\nits distribution parameter unable to be obtained directly using method of\ntraditional VAMP, which prevents the application of VAMP deep unfolding in\nradar constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection.

Although the timing of prefetching should be adjusted in response to\ndynamic memory usage during execution, these systems lack the flexibility to\ncontrol it, which limits the benefits of prefetching.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an\ninterference-suppressed and cost-optimized cell-free ISAC network by\nopportunistically and cooperatively orchestrating distributed radio resources\nto address competing sensing and communication (S\\&C) demands. Specifically, we\nconceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses\ninterference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other\nnetworks without exchanging signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and\nbeamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and\norchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this\nframework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that\nconsiders individual S\\&C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint\nconstraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we\ndevelop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm\nto find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative\nmethod to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT","published":"2025-04-15T03:14:05Z"}

However,\nat this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic,\nleaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic\nordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry\nwould correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode.\nHere, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced\nB$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a\nCurie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is\nclose to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is\nresponsible for the transition.

Recent deep learning\nmethods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain\nconstrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational\ndemands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves\nbeyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively.\nInstead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion\nsignatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal\nmotion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve\nnatural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while\nremaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also\nrequires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature\ndetection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it\noutperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional\napproaches fail.

To more efficiently adapt to\nground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing\nexcessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes\nEKGNet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of a context-aware\nmapping network and a dynamic kernel generation module. The context-aware\nmapping module translates global contextual information of hyperspectral inputs\ninto instructions for combining base convolutional kernels, while the dynamic\nkernels are composed of K groups of base convolutions, analogous to K different\ntypes of experts specializing in fundamental patterns across various\ndimensions.

Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations\n(OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13\ndisciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does\nnot correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities -\nwith some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial\ncounterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in\ncurrent evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy.\nOur mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative\nanalysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths\nemployed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies,\nadaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with\nour automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating\nour methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require\nspecialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation\neducational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical\neffectiveness.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CE,cs.CL,cs.CY,cs.HC","published":"2025-04-21T07:48:20Z"}

We\nfind that multiaccuracy in itself is rather weak, but that the addition of\nglobal calibration (this notion is called calibrated multiaccuracy) boosts its\npower substantially, enough to recover implications that were previously known\nonly assuming the stronger notion of multicalibration.\n  We give evidence that multiaccuracy might not be as powerful as standard weak\nagnostic learning, by showing that there is no way to post-process a\nmultiaccurate predictor to get a weak learner, even assuming the best\nhypothesis has correlation $1/2$. Rather, we show that it yields a restricted\nform of weak agnostic learning, which requires some concept in the class to\nhave correlation greater than $1/2$ with the labels. However, by also requiring\nthe predictor to be calibrated, we recover not just weak, but strong agnostic\nlearning.\n  A similar picture emerges when we consider the derivation of hardcore\nmeasures from predictors satisfying multigroup fairness notions.

We derive an\nelasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular\nmaterial and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are\ndominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical\ntension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level\nmechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the\ncritical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue\neither buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of\nelasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the\nwrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in\nsolid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the\ngroove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial\nshape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory.

This surge underscores the\ncritical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately\nreflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on\nspatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions,\nand texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for\nunprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the\ncontext of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs).\nThe rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration\nhas significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment\nincreasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that\nbridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model\ndisentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level\nperceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then\ncombined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive\nevaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both\nglobal context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual\nprocess, which first interprets overall structure before attending to\nfine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to\nmap the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual\njudgments compared to existing IQA models.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-24T04:06:07Z"}

The investigation focuses on the effects of collinear Griffith\ncracks and dynamic punch loading induced by plane wave propagation. The cracks\nare assumed to be in motion, and a Galilean transformation is employed to\nformulate the problem within a moving coordinate system. The boundary value\nproblem is transformed into a system of coupled Cauchy-type singular integral\nequations, which are solved analytically using the Hilbert transform method.\nThis approach yields elegant closed-form solutions for both the stress\nintensity factor and the crack opening displacement. The study considers two\nmonoclinic crystalline materials, Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate, and\ncompares their behavior with that of an isotropic material to assess the role\nof material anisotropy. Numerical simulations and graphical analysis are\nperformed for the crystalline materials with monoclinic symmetry to evaluate\nthe influence of crack velocity, punch loading, material anisotropy, initial\nstress, and crack geometry on the fracture parameters. As a special case, the\nsystem is analyzed under the action of point loading from the punch pressure,\nand a comparative assessment is conducted between point loading and constant\nnormal punch pressure. The results unveil critical insights into the dynamic\nfracture behavior of anisotropic materials under localized loading.

However, most existing approaches\nfocus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal\ndependencies of real-world data.

To address this, we propose\nTarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates\ntask-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process.\nUnlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff\noptimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to\nimproving downstream model performance through influence functions.\nSpecifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by\nsynthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion\nprocess, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data.\nEvaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in\nAUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC.

A recently introduced technique, called the\nsize-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new\ncontrol parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system\nsize, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to\nquantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum\nsize effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the\nminimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a\ntwo-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape\neffects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature\nabsent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the\norigin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state\nenergy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to\nmany-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state\nenergy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing\nenergy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under\nquasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce\nthermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems.

Key\nlimitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability\n(provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language\nmodels with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming\nthese deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge\ngraph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs\nwith a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by\nconnecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of\ncorresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of\ntext through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from\nan initial lexical graph.

Our\nresults confirm that the f-mode frequency scales linearly with the square root\nof the average density, with anisotropy influencing both the slope and\nintercept of this relation. The dependence of the f-mode frequency on total\nmass reveals distinct trends based on the relative dominance of tangential and\nradial pressure. When the tangential pressure exceeds the radial pressure, the\nfrequency increases with mass, exhibiting rapid growth for massive quark stars.\nWhen the radial pressure dominates, the frequency increases with mass; however,\nin cases where the radial pressure is significantly greater than the tangential\npressure, the frequency decreases as mass increases. For low-mass quark stars,\nstronger tangential pressure leads to an increase in frequency, while beyond a\nthreshold mass, a further increase in tangential pressure results in a decrease\nin frequency. For the chosen range of anisotropic strengths, the frequency\nvaries between 1.3 kHz and 2.3 kHz for the MIT bag EOS and between 1.8 kHz and\n3.4 kHz for EOS-A.

Building on the\nmetaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the\nform of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in\ncontrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment\nto show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning\nstrategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a\ncomputational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured\nscenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic\ncognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this\ndistribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large\nLanguage Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through\ntraining on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved\ncomputational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms\nunstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human\nbehavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic\ncognitive maps.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.ET","published":"2025-04-29T10:55:40Z"}

Recent studies\nindicate a rising risk of AF with increasing OSA severity. However, the\ncommonly used apnea-hypopnea index in clinical practice may not adequately\naccount for the potential cardiovascular risks associated with OSA. (1)\nObjective: to propose and explore a novel method for assessing OSA severity\nconsidering potential connection to cardiac arrhythmias. (2) Method: the\napproach utilizes cross-recurrence features to characterize OSA and AF by\nconsidering the relationships among oxygen desaturation, pulse arrival time,\nand heart-beat intervals. Multinomial logistic regression models were trained\nto predict four levels of OSA severity and four groups related to heart rhythm\nissues.

Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation\nwith geometry-aware 3D primitives.

These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain\nconsistency across partial observations.

In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that\nrelies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's\nimplicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,\nenabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.\nWe propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,\ninitialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are\ncorrected using the initially-learned knowledge.

Dual sets of eigenstates,\ndenoted by \"bra\" and \"ket\", are requested corresponding respectively to the\ncomplex conjugate number-operators. Orthonormal condition exists between the\n\"bra\" and \"ket\" states. We derive a spatially non-localized generating\nfunction, from which $n$-th eigenfunctions can be generated by the raising\noperators in coordinate representation. The \"bra\" and \"ket\" generating\nfunctions are mutually normalized with the imaginary integration measure. The\nprobability density operators defined between the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states are\nnon-Hermitian invariants, which lead to the Schr\\H{o}dinger equations\nrespectively for the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states. While probabilities of \"bra\" and\n\"ket\" states themselves are not conserved quantities because of the decay. The\nimaginary-frequency boson coherent states are defined as eigenstates of\nlowering operators. The minimum uncertainty relation is proved explicitly in\nthe coherent states. Finally the probability average of Heisenberg equation in\nthe coherent states is shown precisely in agreement with the classical equation\nof motion. The quantum-classical correspondence exists in the imaginary\neigenvalue system.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-05-01T11:59:33Z"}

Given the successful implementation of Control Barrier Function\n(CBF)-based safety strategies in a range of control-affine robotic systems,\nCBF-based safe RL demonstrates significant promise for practical applications\nin real-world scenarios. However, integrating these two approaches presents\nseveral challenges. First, embedding safety optimization within the RL training\npipeline requires that the optimization outputs be differentiable with respect\nto the input parameters, a condition commonly referred to as differentiable\noptimization, which is non-trivial to solve.
