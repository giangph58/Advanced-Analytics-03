No significant differences in flame response are identified\nin flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations.\nWe find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in\nparticle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any\nintrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust\nflames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to\nthe lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat\nrelease rate.

Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining.

While widely deployed Human Visual\nSystem (HVS) oriented video coding standards like H.265/HEVC and H.264/AVC are\nefficient, they are not the optimal approaches for Video Coding for Machines\n(VCM) scenarios, leading to unnecessary bitrate expenditure. The academic and\ntechnical exploration within the VCM domain has led to the development of\nseveral strategies, and yet, conspicuous limitations remain in their\nadaptability for multi-task scenarios. To address the challenge, we propose a\nTransformable Video Feature Compression (TransVFC) framework. It offers a\ncompress-then-transfer solution and includes a video feature codec and Feature\nSpace Transform (FST) modules. In particular, the temporal redundancy of video\nfeatures is squeezed by the codec through the scheme-based inter-prediction\nmodule. Then, the codec implements perception-guided conditional coding to\nminimize spatial redundancy and help the reconstructed features align with\ndownstream machine perception.After that, the reconstructed features are\ntransferred to new feature spaces for diverse downstream tasks by FST modules.\nTo accommodate a new downstream task, it only requires training one lightweight\nFST module, avoiding retraining and redeploying the upstream codec and\ndownstream task networks. Experiments show that TransVFC achieves high\nrate-task performance for diverse tasks of different granularities. We expect\nour work can provide valuable insights for video feature compression in\nmulti-task scenarios.

The droplet undergoes\ndifferent fragmentation processes at significantly lower Weber numbers in\nopposed-flow configurations compared to cross-flow configurations. Our findings\nreveal distinct fragmentation modes, namely bag, bag-stamen, and dual-bag\nbreakup, observed at We=9.38, 16.9, and 18.9, respectively. At We = 9.38, the\ncombined effects of bag rupture, rim breakup, and node fragmentation generate\nchild droplets of varying sizes, driven by the interplay of the\nRayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. At We = 16.9, the\ninteraction of aerodynamic and shear forces leads to bag-stamen fragmentation,\ncharacterized by forming a stamen-like structure along with the bag. Both bag\nand bag-stamen breakups result in tri-modal size distributions. However, at We\n= 16.9, fewer tiny droplets are produced compared to the bag breakup observed\nat lower Weber numbers.

The background\ngeometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble\nD3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero\nform as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super\nYang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining\nYang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the\nconfined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on\n$S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic\noperator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation\nfunction of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes.

Our method enables interval\nestimation and hypothesis testing for a wide range of functionals of edge\nvalues in the learned graph using the conditional maximum likelihood estimate.\nOur numerical studies show that introducing a small amount of randomization:\n(i) greatly increases power and yields substantially shorter intervals compared\nto other conditional inference methods, including data splitting; (ii) ensures\nintervals of bounded length in high-dimensional settings where data splitting\nis infeasible due to insufficient samples for inference; (iii) enables\ninference for a wide range of inferential targets in the learned graph,\nincluding measures of node influence and connectivity between nodes.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME,stat.AP,stat.CO","published":"2025-03-31T16:57:04Z"}

Such a model does not necessarily assume\nthat past treatment is not associated with the outcome (the Markov property),\nsince it is possible to model the hazard conditional on only the current\ntreatment value. However, modeling the hazard conditional on the full treatment\nhistory is required in order to interpret the results causally, and such a full\nmodel assumes the Markov property when only including current treatment. This\nis, for example, common in marginal structural Cox models. We demonstrate that\nrelying on the Markov property is problematic, since it only holds in\nunrealistic settings or if the treatment has no causal effect. This is the case\neven if there are no confounders and the true causal effect of treatment really\nonly depends on its current level. Further, we provide an example of a scenario\nwhere the Markov property is not fulfilled, but the Cox model that includes\nonly current treatment as a covariate is correctly specified. Transforming the\nresult to the survival scale does not give the true intervention-specific\nsurvival probabilities, showcasing that it is unclear how to make causal\nstatements from such models.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME","published":"2025-04-02T09:10:48Z"}

SCANAR automates the retrieval and\nprocessing of news articles, offering functionalities such as de-duplication\nand unsupervised relevancy ranking. AIDOC aids filtration by leveraging AI to\nreorder textual data based on relevancy, employing neural networks for semantic\nsimilarity, and subsequently prioritizing likely relevant entries for human\nreview. Results: Twelve internal datasets from horizon scans and four external\nbenchmarking datasets were used.

Despite advances in verification tooling,\nconventional programmers are rarely involved in the verification of their own\ncode, resulting in higher development and maintenance costs for verified\nsoftware. A key barrier to programmer participation in verification practices\nis the disconnect of environments and paradigms between programming and\nverification practices, which limits accessibility and real-time verification.\n  We introduce C*, a proof-integrated language design for C programming. C*\nextends C with verification capabilities, powered by a symbolic execution\nengine and an LCF-style proof kernel. It enables real-time verification by\nallowing programmers to embed proof-code blocks alongside implementation code,\nfacilitating interactive updates to the current proof state. Its expressive and\nextensible proof support allows users to build reusable libraries of logical\ndefinitions, theorems, and programmable proof automation. Crucially, C* unifies\nimplementation and proof code development by using C as the common language.\n  We implemented a prototype of C* and evaluated it on a representative\nbenchmark of small C programs and a challenging real-world case study: the\nattach function of pKVM's buddy allocator.

We also leverage LLM to generate synthetic data and use\nback-translation, text generation for data augmentation. With dataset prepared,\nwe started experimentation.

As the transportation system becomes denser, different\nmodes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other,\ngiving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this\nstudy, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled\ntransportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a\none-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In\nthis system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with\nnon-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus\nthat partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform\nnumerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are\nto each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number\nof zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between\nthe global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves.\nIn contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We\ndeveloped a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that\ntwo distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability\nanalysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our\nresults show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when\nsharing only partial or no direct route overlaps.

The model can reason about the behavior of other vehicles like a\nhuman driver and respond with different decision-making styles, thereby\nimproving the intelligence and diversity of the surrounding vehicles in the\ndriving scenario. By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper\nmodels the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep\nreinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles,\nsimulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics.\nBuilding on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a\nnovel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of\nvehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and\nbinomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving\nenvironments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits\nsuperior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more\ncomplex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles.

Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this,\nbut have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and\ndirection-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of\nobservations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range.\nMany tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to\ninfer gains.

Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially\nobscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a\nsmooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and\nhow this affects gain-calibration results.

However, traditional\nexperimental methods are time-consuming and costly, and existing computational\nmodels face challenges in cross-modal feature fusion, robustness, and\nfalse-negative suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised\ncontrastive multimodal framework, SCMPPI, for PPI prediction. By integrating\nprotein sequence features (AAC, DPC, CKSAAP-ESMC) with PPI network topology\ninformation (Node2Vec graph embedding), and combining an improved supervised\ncontrastive learning strategy, SCMPPI significantly enhances PPI prediction\nperformance. For the PPI task, SCMPPI introduces a negative sample filtering\nmechanism and modifies the contrastive loss function, effectively optimizing\nmultimodal features. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including yeast,\nhuman, and H.pylori, show that SCMPPI outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods (such as DF-PPI and TAGPPI) in key metrics such as accuracy ( 98.01%)\nand AUC (99.62%), and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-species\nprediction (AUC > 99% on multi-species datasets). Furthermore, SCMPPI has been\nsuccessfully applied to CD9 networks, the Wnt pathway, and cancer-specific\nnetworks, providing a reliable tool for disease target discovery.

However, existing discretization methods\nstill suffer from significant information loss, resulting in a notable\nperformance gap compared to continuous representations. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose two quantization-based discretization methods: Product\nQuantization (PQ) and Random Product Quantization (RPQ). PQ partitions the\noriginal feature space into multiple subspaces and independently quantizes each\nsub-vector, producing a fused set of discrete units that retain diverse\ninformation from different subspaces, thus mitigating the loss associated with\nsingle-cluster quantization. RPQ further enhances representation diversity by\nrandomly sampling a fixed proportion of feature dimensions multiple times to\nconstruct sub-vectors, thereby better capturing the variability in the data\ndistribution.

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the\nuse of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering\nfunctionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss\ncoefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system.

Overdraft allows potential payment receivers to assess the\nlikelihood of being paid, allowing them to accept transactions with confidence\nor deny them. Overdraft achieves this by maintaining a loan network that is\nweighted by online reputation. This loan network contains time-limited\nagreements where users pledge to cover another user's payment if necessary.

The\npopularity of SRSs has also driven emerging research on their security aspects,\nwhere data poisoning attack for targeted item promotion is a typical example.\nExisting attack mechanisms primarily focus on increasing the ranks of target\nitems in the recommendation list by injecting carefully crafted interactions\n(i.e., poisoning sequences), which comes at the cost of demoting users' real\npreferences. Consequently, noticeable recommendation accuracy drops are\nobserved, restricting the stealthiness of the attack. Additionally, the\ngenerated poisoning sequences are prone to substantial repetition of target\nitems, which is a result of the unitary objective of boosting their overall\nexposure and lack of effective diversity regularizations. Such homogeneity not\nonly compromises the authenticity of these sequences, but also limits the\nattack effectiveness, as it ignores the opportunity to establish sequential\ndependencies between the target and many more items in the SRS. To address the\nissues outlined, we propose a Diversity-aware Dual-promotion Sequential\nPoisoning attack method named DDSP for SRSs.

However, previous works have primarily focused on\ntwo-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather\nthan pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public\ngoods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various\ntypes of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games,\nincluding linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit\nfunctions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider\nthe continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the\npair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion\nfitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative\ninvestments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear\npublic goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the\ncooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating\nbenefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily\nstable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit\nfunction, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the\nthreshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For\nintermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies\ncan coexist. When the threshold value is large, a unique repellor displays.\nFinally, we perform individual-based simulations to validate our theoretical\nresults.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph","published":"2025-04-09T10:47:05Z"}

However, its implementation on quantum hardware is\nchallenging due to the noise inherent in these systems, necessitating the use\nof quantum error correction (QEC) codes. Current QML research remains primarily\ntheoretical, often assuming noise-free environments and offering little insight\ninto the integration of QEC with QML implementations. To address this, we\ninvestigate the performance of a simple, parity-classifying Variational Quantum\nClassifier (VQC) implemented with the [[4,2,2]] error-detecting stabiliser code\nin a simulated noisy environment, marking the first study into the\nimplementation of a QML algorithm with a QEC code.

We demonstrate that the stabiliser code improves the training accuracy\nat convergence compared to noisy implementations without QEC.

The key insight is to build\npolynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with\ntwo additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with\nthe \"non-standard\" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the\nRLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The\nresulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with\nmachine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding\nmode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest\nmode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the\nsystem's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded\nresult, and restores the application's rounding mode.

These languages have a low level of abstraction and\nrequire engineers to manage control and scheduling manually. High-Level\nSynthesis (HLS) tools attempt to lift this level of abstraction by translating\nC/C++ code into hardware descriptions, but their reliance on imperative\nparadigms leads to challenges in deriving parallelism due to pointer aliasing\nand sequential execution models.\n  Functional programming, with its inherent purity, immutability, and\nparallelism, presents a more natural abstraction for FPGA design. Existing\nfunctional hardware description tools such as Clash enable high-level circuit\ndescriptions but lack automated scheduling and control mechanisms. Prior work\nby Folmer introduced a framework integrating SDF-AP graphs into Haskell for\nautomatic hardware generation, but it lacked hierarchy and reusability.\n  This paper extends that framework by introducing hierarchical pattern\nspecification, enabling structured composition and scalable parallelism. Key\ncontributions include: (1) automatic hardware generation, where both data and\ncontrol paths are derived from functional specifications with hierarchical\npatterns, (2) parameterized buffers using GADTs, eliminating the need for\nmanual buffer definitions and facilitating component reuse, and (3) provision\nof a reference \"golden model\" that can be simulated in the integrated\nenvironment for validation.\n  The core focus of this paper is on methodology.

However, this improved accuracy comes at the\ncost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning\nsequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in\ntackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it\nembeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically\nbroken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the\nsemantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens\nit generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically\naccelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry\nout simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model\nonly to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly,\nSpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in\npreserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation\ntechniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level\nequivalence at each step.

These\nCA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed\nrelationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential\naspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance,\nwalking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but\ndiffer in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related.\nConsequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these\ninherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels\ntypically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is\nunavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this\nlimitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity\nlabels to capture semantic relationships.

Specifically, we first\nconstruct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across\ndocuments, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly\nsplit it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite\nthe retrieved documents excluding private triples. Finally, PPO algorithm\noptimizes the rewriting model to minimize private triples and maximize public\ntriples retention. Experiments on four QA datasets demonstrate that Eraser4RAG\nachieves superior erase performance than GPT-4o.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL","published":"2025-04-14T06:10:31Z"}

But\nthere is little research on their validity regarding specific presence\ndimensions and their responsiveness to differences in perception among users.\nWe investigated four presence questionnaires (SUS, PQ, IPQ, Bouchard) on their\nresponsiveness to intensity variations of known presence dimensions and asked\nusers about their consistency with their experience. Therefore, we created five\nVR scenarios that were designed to emphasize a specific presence dimension. Our\nfindings showed heterogeneous sensitivity of the questionnaires dependent on\nthe different dimensions of presence. This highlights a context-specific\nsuitability of presence questionnaires. The questionnaires' sensitivity was\nfurther stated as lower than actually perceived. Based on our findings, we\noffer guidance on selecting these questionnaires based on their suitability for\nparticular use cases.","main_category":"cs.HC","categories":"cs.HC","published":"2025-04-14T12:18:05Z"}

For a given computational power budget, we vary the\ncluster size, i.e., the number of available servers. A job-level analysis\nreveals that Join Idle Queue (JIQ) and Least Work Left (LWL) exhibit an optimal\nworking point for a fixed utilization coefficient as the number of servers is\nvaried, whereas Round Robin (RR) demonstrates monotonously worsening\nperformance. Additionally, we explore the accuracy of simple G/G queue\napproximations.

Despite\nthis, conventional DCS suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single\nacquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by\nthe high peak power of mode-locked pulses, necessitating coherent averaging.\nConsequently, averaging numerous interferograms compromises both the\nexceptional time resolution and places greater demands on long-term mutual\ncoherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to\nenhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in\ncoherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs\nwith mode spacing of $\\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition\nrate of $\\sim$250 MHz.

Observations of the Milky Way and local galaxies have\nrevealed an ubiquitous disk structure with two distinctive components: an old\nthick disk and a relatively young thin disk. The formation of this dual-disk\nstructure and the mechanisms that develop the thickness of the disk are still\nunclear. Whether the disk thickness inherit from the birth environment or is\nestablished through secular dynamical heating after formation is under debate.\nIn this work we identify a relatively young ($\\sim$6.6 billion years old)\ngeometric thick disk in the Milky Way, with a scale height of $0.64$ kpc at the\nSolar Circle. This young thick component exhibits comparable thickness and\nflaring strength to the canonical old thick disk but is more radially extended\nand systematically younger. We also identify thin disk components that formed\nbefore and after this young thick disk. Detailed analysis of the solar vicinity\nstructure suggests that the young thick disk marks the onset of a new phase of\nupside-down disk formation. These findings strongly discount the role of\nsecular dynamical heating and support a turbulent, bursty birth environment as\nthe primary mechanism behind thick disk formation.

Various statistical methods have\nbeen proposed for AE signal detection in these databases, flagging\ndrug-specific AEs with disproportionately high observed counts compared to\nexpected counts under independence. However, signal detection remains\nchallenging for rare AEs or newer drugs, which receive small observed and\nexpected counts and thus suffer from reduced statistical power. Principled\ninformation sharing on signal strengths across drugs/AEs is crucial in such\ncases to enhance signal detection.

In this work, we position fusion depth, scalability, and\ndedicated multimodal capacity as primary factors for effective fusion. We\nintroduce DeepMLF, a novel multimodal language model (LM) with learnable tokens\ntailored toward deep fusion. DeepMLF leverages an audiovisual encoder and a\npretrained decoder LM augmented with multimodal information across its layers.\nWe append learnable tokens to the LM that: 1) capture modality interactions in\na controlled fashion and 2) preserve independent information flow for each\nmodality. These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal\nself-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through\ncross-attention MM Blocks. Serving as dedicated multimodal capacity, this\ndesign enables progressive fusion across multiple layers, providing depth in\nthe fusion process. Our training recipe combines modality-specific losses and\nlanguage modelling loss, with the decoder LM tasked to predict ground truth\npolarity. Across three MSA benchmarks with varying dataset characteristics,\nDeepMLF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results confirm that deeper\nfusion leads to better performance, with optimal fusion depths (5-7) exceeding\nthose of existing approaches. Additionally, our analysis on the number of\nfusion tokens reveals that small token sets ($\\sim$20) achieve optimal\nperformance. We examine the importance of representation learning order (fusion\ncurriculum) through audiovisual encoder initialization experiments. Our\nablation studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion design and\ngating while providing a holistic examination of DeepMLF's scalability to LLMs,\nand the impact of each training objective and embedding regularization.","main_category":"cs.CL","categories":"cs.CL,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-15T11:28:02Z"}

However, the\nlow-dimensional embeddings are often difficult to interpret. To facilitate the\nexploration and interpretation of low-dimensional embeddings, we introduce a\nnew concept named partitioning with explanations. The idea is to partition the\ndata shown through the embedding into groups, each of which is given a sparse\nexplanation using the original high-dimensional attributes. We introduce an\nobjective function that quantifies how much we can learn through observing the\nexplanations of the data partitioning, using information theory, and also how\ncomplex the explanations are. Through parameterization of the complexity, we\ncan tune the solutions towards the desired granularity. We propose InfoClus,\nwhich optimizes the partitioning and explanations jointly, through greedy\nsearch constrained over a hierarchical clustering. We conduct a qualitative and\nquantitative analysis of InfoClus on three data sets. We contrast the results\non the Cytometry data with published manual analysis results, and compare with\ntwo other recent methods for explaining embeddings (RVX and VERA). These\ncomparisons highlight that InfoClus has distinct advantages over existing\nprocedures and methods.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a doped HfO2-based, silicon-compatible\nasymmetric resonant ferroelectric tunnel junction design with a quantum well\nembedded between two ferroelectric layers, replacing the conventional\nmetal-ferroelectric-metal structure. Using a self-consistent coupling of the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we\ndemonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading\nto a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the\ntunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust,\nwhile the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and\nreducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well\nsignificantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak\nvalue of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the\nresistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V.

Recently, deep learning methods have\nbeen widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has\nthree main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer.\nWhile the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of\nsolution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc,\nleaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an\nunsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed\nPINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to\nfind the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural\nnetworks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each\nlayer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture\nparameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of\nPINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our\napproach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior\nusage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as\nthe associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on\nseveral benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers'\nequations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS\nachieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting\nobservation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a\nprominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that\narchitectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior\nperformance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.","main_category":"math.NA","categories":"math.NA,cs.NA","published":"2025-04-15T12:42:32Z"}

Modified Lagrangian Mean (MLM) states have been proposed by\nM. E. McIntyre using the Lagrangian conserved variables potential vorticity and\npotential temperature to label air parcels, thus avoiding the need to calculate\ntrajectories explicitly. Methven and Berrisford further defined a zonally\nsymmetric MLM state for global atmospheric flow in terms of mass in zonal\nangular momentum ($z$) and potential temperature ($\\theta$) coordinates. We\nprove that for any snapshot of an atmospheric flow in a single hemisphere,\nthere exists a unique energy-minimising MLM state in geophysical coordinates\n(latitude and pressure). Since the state is an energy minimum, it is suitable\nfor quantification of finite amplitude disturbances and examining atmospheric\ninstability. This state is obtained by solving a free surface problem, which we\nframe as the minimisation of an optimal transport cost over a class of source\nmeasures. The solution consists of a source measure, encoding surface pressure,\nand an optimal transport map, connecting the distribution of mass in\ngeophysical coordinates to the known distribution of mass in $(z, \\theta)$. We\nshow that this problem reduces to an optimal transport problem with a known\nsource measure, which has a numerically feasible discretisation.

However, to realize the swimming\nperformance of biology, there is a need for soft robotic swimmers with both\ndistributed muscles and kinematic feedback. This study presents the design and\nswimming performance of a soft robotic fish with independently controllable\nmuscles and embedded kinematic sensing distributed along the body. The soft\nswimming robot consists of an interior flexible spine, three axially\ndistributed sets of HASEL artificial muscles, embedded strain gauges, a\nstreamlined silicone body, and off-board electronics. In a fixed configuration,\nthe soft robot generates a maximum thrust of 7.9 mN when excited near its first\nresonant frequency (2 Hz) with synchronized antagonistic actuation of all\nmuscles. When excited near its second resonant frequency (8 Hz), synchronized\nmuscle actuation generates 5.0 mN of thrust. By introducing a sequential phase\noffset into the muscle actuation, the thrust at the second resonant frequency\nincreases to 7.2 mN, a 44% increase from simple antagonistic activation. The\nsequential muscle activation improves the thrust by increasing 1) the tail-beat\nvelocity and 2) traveling wave content in the swimming kinematics by four\ntimes. Further, the second resonant frequency (8 Hz) generates nearly as much\nthrust as the first resonance (2 Hz) while requiring only $\\approx25$% of the\ntail displacement, indicating that higher resonant frequencies have benefits\nfor swimming in confined environments where a smaller kinematic envelope is\nnecessary.

Current\nmethods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry\nprimarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally\nDerived Bathymetry (SDB). However, SDB methods often require extensive manual\nfieldwork or costly reference data, while SfM-MVS approaches face challenges\neven after refraction correction. These include depth data gaps and noise in\nenvironments with homogeneous visual textures, which hinder the creation of\naccurate and complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed. To address\nthese challenges, this work introduces a methodology that combines the\nhigh-fidelity 3D reconstruction capabilities of the SfM-MVS methods with\nstate-of-the-art refraction correction techniques, along with the spectral\nanalysis capabilities of a new deep learning-based method for bathymetry\nprediction.

However, the algebraic complexity of surface-surface\nintersections makes gaps and overlaps between surfaces difficult to avoid for\nin-the-wild surface models.

Applying contemporary\ntechniques for the 3D GWN on arbitrary curved surfaces would require some form\nof geometric discretization, potentially inducing containment\nmisclassifications near boundary components. In contrast, our proposed method\ncomputes an accurate GWN directly on the curved geometry of the input model.

In this\nwork, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic\nthermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations,\nand the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative\nnoise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that\nthermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric\nstochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel\nHermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical\nviscous friction.

This progression, in turn, lays the\ngroundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity\nConjecture (WGC). Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the\nReissner-Nordstr$\\\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to\nsustain super-extremality of the charge parameter. If such conditions arise,\nthese black holes transition into naked singularities-a scenario that is highly\nundesirable due to the loss of causality and the breakdown of space-time\ngeometry.

To address\nthese issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the\ninterpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the\nMultimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its\nunivariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of\ncross-modal interactions.

These methods\noften encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of\nphotorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines\ngeometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for\ntransparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on\ngeometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.\nIn the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular\nmodeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric\naccuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth\nextraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending\nweights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust\nweighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task\nunder realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex\ntransparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that\nTSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of\ntransparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.\nSpecifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a\n37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score\ncompared to the top baseline.

Here, we introduce a method to\ncompute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the\nsystem of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control\noperations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity\nrequirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of\n$n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol\non IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure fermionic and bosonic\nsingle-particle spectra of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Schwinger\nmodel, respectively, and the out-of-time-order correlator in the\ntransverse-field Ising model. In the experiment, we further introduce a\nsignal-processing strategy that integrates signal filtering and correlation\nanalysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the\nnoisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum\nmany-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic\nhardware limitations and noise.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-17T14:27:23Z"}
