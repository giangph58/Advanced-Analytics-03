While\nlogical axioms are a cornerstone of ontology design, natural language elements\nsuch as annotations are equally critical for conveying intended meaning and\nensuring consistent term usage.

To\nthis end, it proposes an approach founded on the use of a new structure, named\n'ontological component' and defined by: a term-centered design; enhanced\ncharacterization of both formal and natural language statements; an\noperationalizable definition of communicated meaning based on general\nassertions; and the integration of natural language elements into the logical\ntheory. By formalizing the meaning of ontological components, this work seeks\nto enhance the semantic robustness of terms, improving their clarity and\naccessibility across domains.

The ribosomal exit tunnels from different\nspecies have elements of conservation and differentiation in structural and\nphysico-chemical properties. In this study, by simulating the elongation and\nescape processes of nascent proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnels of four\ndifferent organisms, we show that the escape process has conserved mechanisms\nacross the domains of life. Specifically, it is found that the escape process\nof proteins follows the diffusion mechanism given by a simple diffusion model\nand the median escape time positively correlates with the number of hydrophobic\nresidues and the net charge of a protein for all the exit tunnels considered.\nThese properties hold for twelve distinct proteins considered in two slightly\ndifferent and improved G\\=o-like models.

In particular, the relatively strong\nhydrophobicity of the E. coli's tunnel and the unusually high number of\nnegatively charged amino acids on the tunnel's surface of H. marismortui lead\nto substantially slower escapes of proteins at these tunnels than at those of\nS. cerevisisae and H. sapiens.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-04-02T13:40:58Z"}

However, most existing hybrid frameworks rely on\nexplicit recurrent formulations, which suffer from numerical instability and\nerror accumulation during long-horizon forecasting. In this work, we introduce\nIm-PiNDiff, a novel implicit physics-integrated neural differentiable solver\nfor stable and accurate modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. Inspired by deep\nequilibrium models, Im-PiNDiff advances the state using implicit fixed-point\nlayers, enabling robust long-term simulation while remaining fully end-to-end\ndifferentiable. To enable scalable training, we introduce a hybrid gradient\npropagation strategy that integrates adjoint-state methods with reverse-mode\nautomatic differentiation. This approach eliminates the need to store\nintermediate solver states and decouples memory complexity from the number of\nsolver iterations, significantly reducing training overhead. We further\nincorporate checkpointing techniques to manage memory in long-horizon rollouts.\nNumerical experiments on various spatiotemporal PDE systems, including\nadvection-diffusion processes, Burgers' dynamics, and multi-physics chemical\nvapor infiltration processes, demonstrate that Im-PiNDiff achieves superior\npredictive performance, enhanced numerical stability, and substantial\nreductions in memory and runtime cost relative to explicit and naive implicit\nbaselines.

Despite\nprevious works endeavoring to address the fully-supervised single-view or\ncross-view dense video captioning, they lapse in the proposed unsupervised task\ndue to the significant inter-view gap caused by temporal misalignment and\nirrelevant object interference. Hence, we propose a Gaze Consensus-guided\nEgo-Exo Adaptation Network (GCEAN) that injects the gaze information into the\nlearned representations for the fine-grained alignment between the Ego and Exo\nviews. Specifically, the Score-based Adversarial Learning Module (SALM)\nincorporates a discriminative scoring network to learn unified view-invariant\nrepresentations for bridging distinct views from a global level. Then, the Gaze\nConsensus Construction Module (GCCM) utilizes gaze representations to\nprogressively calibrate the learned global view-invariant representations for\nextracting the video temporal contexts based on focusing regions. Moreover, the\ngaze consensus is constructed via hierarchical gaze-guided consistency losses\nto spatially and temporally align the source and target views. To support our\nresearch, we propose a new EgoMe-UEA-DVC benchmark and experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method, which outperforms many related methods by a\nlarge margin.

One\npopular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism\nknown as a dispute game for block proposals.

However, limited attention has been given to the\ninterpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In\naddition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their\nown homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered,\nand an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering\n(IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is\nfully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples\nare grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors\nof all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the\nclusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making\nprocess of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices\nare introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by\ncapturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different\nstyles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data\nrepresentation capability. After determining the antecedents of all the fuzzy\nrules, the optimization problem of IS-TSK-FC can be iteratively solved in an\nalternation manner. The effectiveness of IS-TSK-FC as an interpretable\nclustering tool is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets with unknown implicit/explicit styles.

Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task\nidentification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks.

However,\nexisting FM based methodologies neglect the negative impact of weakly\ncorrelated sample pairs and fail to account for the key distinctions among\nremote sensing texts, leading to biased and superficial exploration of sample\npairs. To address these challenges, we propose an approach named iEBAKER (an\nImproved Eliminate Before Align strategy with Keyword Explicit Reasoning\nframework) for RSITR. Specifically, we propose an innovative Eliminate Before\nAlign (EBA) strategy to filter out the weakly correlated sample pairs, thereby\nmitigating their deviations from optimal embedding space during\nalignment.Further, two specific schemes are introduced from the perspective of\nwhether local similarity and global similarity affect each other.

The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation\ndominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As\na result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric\nfields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature\nproblem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB\nphase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated\nwhen the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar\nfield is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to\nthe cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction\nproblem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned\nproblems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc","published":"2025-04-08T09:18:30Z"}

PME, rooted in principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), not only identifies a reduced set of critical modes\nbut also re-parameterizes the original design space, enabling direct and\ninterpretable manipulations of shape modifications within the reduced space.\nAlongside the \"physics-informed\" version (PI-PME), which enriches geometry with\nlow-fidelity distributed and lumped physical quantities, a \"physics-driven\"\nvariant (PD-PME) is introduced that focuses exclusively on physical parameters.\nBoth formulations employ PCA to capture the principal modes of variability yet\ndiffer in their balance between geometric and physical information, through the\nad-hoc definition of a weighted inner product. Through test cases involving the\nRAE-2822 airfoil, a bio-inspired underwater glider, a naval propeller, and the\nDTMB-5415 destroyer-type vessel, it is shown how the resulting frameworks\nprovide a first-level assessment of design variability, offer interpretability\nregarding which original variables most strongly affect performance, and\nefficiently bridge geometric and physical parameters.

The INS reveals\ntwo distinct spin-wave excitations below TN : one around 5.6 meV and the other\nat 10 to 15 meV. The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high\nmomentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and\nspin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a\nlinear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits\nspin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and\nnext-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other\nruthenate trimers in this series.

Our\ncontributions include: (1) the introduction of modular KAN-based architectures\ntailored for tabular data analysis, (2) the development of a transfer learning\nframework for KAN models, enabling effective knowledge transfer between\ndomains, (3) the development of model-specific interpretability for tabular\ndata learning, reducing reliance on post hoc and model-agnostic analysis, and\n(4) comprehensive evaluation of vanilla supervised learning across binary and\nmulti-class classification tasks. Through extensive benchmarking on diverse\npublic datasets, TabKAN demonstrates superior performance in supervised\nlearning while significantly outperforming classical and Transformer-based\nmodels in transfer learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the advantage of\nKAN-based architectures in efficiently transferring knowledge across domains,\nbridging the gap between traditional machine learning and deep learning for\nstructured data.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T03:46:10Z"}

However, acquiring accurate target sensing\nparameter information becomes challenging due to fractional delay and Doppler\nshift occurrence, as well as effects introduced by the coexistence of\nnear-field (NF) and far-field (FF) targets associated with large-scale antenna\nsystems.

While there has been\nadvances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they\nonly provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still\nindispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can\ncreate a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models\nwith automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global\nmodels can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning.\nWe formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the\nmerging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server\nbroadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs\nto send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of\nperiodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global\nmodel, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data\ndistribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds\ncaused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID\nsettings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in\nwhich FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including\nclustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T10:44:14Z"}

Therefore,\ninter-cell interference (ICI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are crucial\nissues that must be managed efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. In\nradio frequency (RF) networks, rate splitting (RS) is proposed as a\ntransmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously following a certain\nstrategy. It was shown that RS provides high data rates compared to orthogonal\nand non-orthogonal interference management schemes.

The cause of such outbursts is\nbelieved to be thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disc. However, some\nof these transient sources show unusually long outbursts. For example, EXO\n0748-676 remained in outburst for at least 23 years before entering a\nquiescence, only to re-emerge 16 years later. We aim to investigate if such\nlong outbursts could be due to the usual disc instability, or if any other\nmechanism is required. In order to address this question, we systematically\ncompare various properties of long outburst and short outburst NS LMXBs. For\nthis, we analyze the long-term X-ray light curves of many short orbital period\n(hours) NS LMXBs, examining the outburst duration and the inferred accretion\nrate, and estimate the accretion disc mass. Our study shows that long outburst\nsources are well-separated from the short outburst ones in parameter spaces\ninvolving accretion rate, disc mass, outburst duration, etc. in four ways.

However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the\nsubtlety of actions. To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised\nMAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled. We first evaluate\ntraditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these\nmethods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error\naccumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the\ncommon practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as\npseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which\nexplicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the\noffline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.\nMoreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically\nfilter noisy labels of different classes. We then build a memory-based\nprototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and\nused to guide the subsequent model training phase.

Eye trackers within HMDs provide a special opportunity for such\nsetups as it is possible to facilitate gaze-based research and interaction.\nHowever, estimating users' gaze information often requires raw eye images and\nvideos that contain iris textures, which are considered a gold standard\nbiometric for user authentication, and this raises privacy concerns. Previous\nresearch in the eye-tracking community focused on obfuscating iris textures\nwhile keeping utility tasks such as gaze estimation accurate. Despite these\nattempts, there is no comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art\napproaches. Considering all, in this paper, we benchmark blurring, noising,\ndownsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer to obfuscate user\nidentity, and compare their impact on image quality, privacy, utility, and risk\nof imposter attack on two datasets. We use eye segmentation and gaze estimation\nas utility tasks, and reduction in iris recognition accuracy as a measure of\nprivacy protection, and false acceptance rate to estimate risk of attack. Our\nexperiments show that canonical image processing methods like blurring and\nnoising cause a marginal impact on deep learning-based tasks. While\ndownsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer are effective in\nhiding user identifiers, iris style transfer, with higher computation cost,\noutperforms others in both utility tasks, and is more resilient against spoof\nattacks. Our analyses indicate that there is no universal optimal approach to\nbalance privacy, utility, and computation burden. Therefore, we recommend\npractitioners consider the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and\npossible combinations of those to reach an optimal privacy-utility trade-off.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-14T14:29:38Z"}

To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability.

Herein, we introduce LightFormer, a lightweight decoder\nfor time-critical tasks that involve unstructured targets, such as disaster\nassessment, unmanned aerial vehicle search-and-rescue, and cultural heritage\nmonitoring. LightFormer employs a feature-fusion and refinement module built on\nchannel processing and a learnable gating mechanism to aggregate multi-scale,\nmulti-range information efficiently, which drastically curtails model\ncomplexity.

While this can be\nacceptable for use cases where specific user templates are not predetermined,\nit represents a missed opportunity to enhance security in scenarios where\nintegrating PAD with the fingerprint verification system could significantly\nleverage users' templates, which are the real target of a potential\npresentation attack. This does not mean that a PAD should be specifically\ndesigned for such users; that would imply the availability of many enrolled\nusers' PAI and, consequently, complexity, time, and cost increase. On the\ncontrary, we propose to equip a basic PAD, designed according to the state of\nthe art, with an innovative add-on module called the Closeness Binary Code (CC)\nmodule. The term \"closeness\" refers to a peculiar property of the bona\nfide-related features: in an Euclidean feature space, genuine fingerprints tend\nto cluster in a specific pattern. First, samples from the same finger are close\nto each other, then samples from other fingers of the same user and finally,\nsamples from fingers of other users. This property is statistically verified in\nour previous publication, and further confirmed in this paper. It is\nindependent of the user population and the feature set class, which can be\nhandcrafted or deep network-based (embeddings). Therefore, the add-on can be\ndesigned without the need for the targeted user samples; moreover, it exploits\nher/his samples' \"closeness\" property during the verification stage.

This study evaluates the transition to a\nbetter-quality paint and its implications for the wall's long-term\npreservation. The rapid fading of the initial materials required an\nunsustainable repainting rate, burdening volunteers. Lifetime simulations based\non a collections demography framework suggest that repainting efforts must\ncontinue at a rate of some hundreds of hearts per week to maintain a stable\npercentage of hearts in good condition. This finding highlights the need for a\nsustainable management strategy that includes regular maintenance or further\nreduction of the fading rate.\n  Methodologically, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using a\ncollections demography approach, supported by citizen science and social media\ndata, to inform heritage management decisions. An agent-based simulation is\nused to propagate the multiple uncertainties measured. The methodology provides\na robust basis for modeling and decision-making, even in a case like this,\nwhere reliance on publicly available images and volunteer-collected data\nintroduces variability. Future studies could improve data within a citizen\nscience framework by inviting public submissions, using on-site calibration\ncharts, and increasing volunteer involvement for longitudinal data collection.\nThis research illustrates the flexibility of the collections demography\nframework, firstly by showing its applicability to an outdoor monument, which\nis very different from the published case studies, and secondly by\ndemonstrating how it can work even with low-quality data.","main_category":"cs.CY","categories":"cs.CY","published":"2025-04-15T13:51:14Z"}

While recent\nmethods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on\ngeometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from\nthe point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation\nfor 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images,\nleading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for\nestimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method\ncombines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified\nnetwork to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets,\nand NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted\nclass based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part.\nFinally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to\nrecover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we\nintroduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date,\nfeaturing photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real\nsensors.

Inversions were performed for each\nsnapshot to determine mean density and acoustic radius, tracking their temporal\nevolution and estimating systematic uncertainty due to magnetic activity.

To this end, it is crucial to identify a preferably small subset\nof features from a presumably large set that can be used to explain a solution.\nIn mathematical optimization, feature selection has received little attention\nyet.

Built upon the classical Encoder-\nDistortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking\nmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark\nextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,\nallowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A\nlocalization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark\nregions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and\nimproving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask\ninto the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in\ndesignated local regions for enhanced robustness.
