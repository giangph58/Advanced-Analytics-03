This work systematically explores\nthe duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles -- Carroll and\nGalilean -- within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical\nactions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of\nmotion and demonstrate that static fractons exhibit duality with\nelectric-sector of Carroll particles, while mobile fracton dipoles correspond\nto both electric and magnetic sectors of Galilean particles. The algebraic\nunderpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses,\nrevealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean\nalgebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a geometric\nframework for fracton gravity, linking it to non-Lorentzian spacetime\ngeometries. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and\nultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity\nand exotic condensed matter systems.","main_category":"hep-th","categories":"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el,gr-qc","published":"2025-03-27T16:24:08Z"}

In\norder to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the\nconstruction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods\nfor constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks:\nthey are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison\nof the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in\norder to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-03-27T16:33:52Z"}

Nevertheless, the applicability of the\nQUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the\nexponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of\nthe quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects.\nThis exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting\nfluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical\nefficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the\nQUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent\nnon-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing\nenvironment.

An equilibrium networking formalism which\nutilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can\nbind and unbind from one another. Here, \\textit{networking} refers to the\nintroduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not\nnecessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By\ncombining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a\nweighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The\nnetworking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the\nLangevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible\nconfigurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple\nexample of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another\ndemonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in\na collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the\ndynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average\nnumber of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for\neach type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is\nintroduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above\na minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate\nthat this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied\nto a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical\npredictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.","main_category":"cond-mat.soft","categories":"cond-mat.soft","published":"2025-03-31T10:25:26Z"}

We find LISA\nwill detect MBH mergers in diverse host galaxies, including lower-mass and\nsatellite galaxies. These hosts are $\\sim 50$ times more star-forming than\ntypical galaxies of the same mass, forming a tight power-law in SFR--$M_{\\rm\ngal}$ space: ${\\rm SFR} = 10^{-8} M_{\\rm\ngal}^{0.9}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, independent of redshift.

We develop enhanced analyses for quantum simulation of Schr\\\"odinger\noperators with black-box potential via the pseudo-spectral method, providing\nexplicit resource estimates independent of wavefunction assumptions. These\nbounds are applied to assess the complexity of optimization through QHD. Our\nfindings pertain to unconstrained convex optimization in $d$ dimensions. In\ncontinuous time, we demonstrate that QHD, with suitable parameters, can achieve\narbitrarily fast convergence rates. The optimization speed limit arises solely\nfrom the discretization of the dynamics, mirroring a property of the classical\ndynamics underlying QHD. Considering this cost, we show that a $G$-Lipschitz\nconvex function can be optimized to an error of $\\epsilon$ with\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{1.5}G^2 R^2/\\epsilon^2)$ queries. Moreover, under\nreasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation,\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(d/\\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary.

By employing a gating network to route input\ntokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the\ncorresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is\nchallenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation,\nwhich leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and\ninsufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by\nnumerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level.\nPrevious works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized\nby the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to\nstatic execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at\nruntime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a\nhigher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration\nand specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others\n(collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific\nsubset of experts (specialized).

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency.

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic\nsegmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions,\na comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision\nmodels under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills\nthis gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial\nrobustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to\nassess the impact of localized corruptions.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01887v1","title":"Dual mechanism of Anti-Seizure Medications in controlling seizure\n  activity","summary":"Background: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can reduce seizure duration, but\ntheir precise modes of action are unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether\nASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a\nshorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity\npatterns.\n  Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from\n28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure\noccurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns\n(states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these\nto different ASM levels.\n  Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency\n(r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p <\n0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct\nmechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:\n  Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering\nunmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these\n'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).\n  Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without\ntaper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224%\nlonger durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p\n< 0.001).\n  Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress\nspecific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and\n(ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight\nthe complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized\ndosing strategies for epilepsy management. These findings may also have\nimplications in understanding the effects of ASMs on cognition and mood.","main_category":"q-bio.NC","categories":"q-bio.NC","published":"2025-04-02T16:44:51Z"}

We extend history-based\nrecursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting\nPINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii)\nmulti-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation\nparameters (PMR-PINN).

Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce\nand interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using\nrealistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the\nhost galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis,\nand simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the\nBPASS code using three different kick prescriptions.

Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit\ncompared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing\ndifferent kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement\nwhen including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%,\nwhile lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets.

For early-type hosts,\nthe predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch\nthreshold applied.

In this paper, we ask:\nHow can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most\nfacial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake\ngenerators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting\ninconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach\" the detector to\nlearn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to\nelaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and\ngeneral artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize\ndeepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face\nInconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from\nthe challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing\ninconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform\nsurrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by\nthe generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization\nstems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or\nboth of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level\npseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA\nand USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we\nemploy a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module\nthat uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the\nFIA.

However, our study reveals a\nsurprising contradiction to this prevailing perspective. Through extensive\nexperiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based\nin-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning\nvariants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales\nand benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected\nphenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical\nexplanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality\ndriving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning\nfalters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from\ndemonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual\ndistance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers\ndespite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative\nunderperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process,\neven as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes.

This scatter decreases as the timescale\nover which SFRs are averaged increases, declining to a non-negligible ~0.15 -\n0.25 dex at 2 Gyr, underscoring the importance of long-timescale SFH diversity\nto the SFMS scatter. Furthermore, galaxies currently above (below) the SFMS\ntend to have been above (below) the SFMS for at least ~1 Gyr, providing\nevidence that individual galaxies may follow different median tracks through\nSFR$-\\mathrm{M}_*$ space.

Perhaps the most studied defect in a vdW material is the negatively\ncharged boron vacancy center ($V^{-}_{B}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).\nHowever, many of the $V^{-}_{B}$ electronic and spin transition rates and\nbranching ratios are not fully known.

In this paper, we address this\nproblem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish\nthemselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited\nfleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the\nfleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and\nin turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each\narea. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand\ndevelopment. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time\nfulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach.

The additional energy loss due to NMM\ncan significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the\nMESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in\nlow-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He\ncore mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical\n$Z = 1 Z_{\\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$, and $\\mu_v = 3 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\\sim 5\\%$, and the TRGB\nluminosity increases by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However,\ncontrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs\nearlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the\nadditional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core,\nreleases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the\nhydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass\nfaster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak\nluminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and\nsub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency.\nWe found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash\ncan induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot\nregion into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in\nNMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter\nthe surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment\neffect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW\nmixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to\neffectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-08T04:33:18Z"}

By performing transient\nreflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the\ngate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally\ndistinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we\nfind that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron\nextraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises\nfrom interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the\nexcess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence\ngenerates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the\nconduction band offset with external electric field.

Although\nthis standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental\ndata, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics,\npostulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e.,\nindividual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers\nthis contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical\nquestion rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical\nstrongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on\none-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation\nof STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a\ntheoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going\nbeyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show\nwhy, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with\nexperimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and\nTersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate\ninterpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe\nthe process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of\nmany-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states.

For a periodic\nsystem consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\\mathbf\nr}_j$ where $j=1,2,\\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density\n$\\rho({\\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived\nelectrostatic energy can be expressed as, \\[ {\\mathcal U} = \\sum_{i<j}^N\nq_iq_j\\nu({\\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \\sum_{j=1}^N q_j \\int_V d{\\mathbf\nr}_0\\,\\rho({\\mathbf r}_0) \\nu({\\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_V d{\\mathbf\nr}_0 \\int_V d{\\mathbf r}_1\\,\\rho({\\mathbf r}_0)\\rho({\\mathbf r}_1) \\nu({\\mathbf\nr}_{01}), \\] where ${\\mathbf r}_{ij}={\\mathbf r}_i - {\\mathbf r}_j$ is the\nrelative vector and $\\nu({\\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise\ninteraction. The charge density $\\rho({\\mathbf r})$ is free of\nDelta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit\ndiscontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated\nsystem by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\\lvert {\\mathbf r} \\rvert$ or\nother modified Coulomb interactions with $\\nu({\\mathbf r})$. For a particular\nsystem of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the\nimplementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of\nthe background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent\npotentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.","main_category":"physics.comp-ph","categories":"physics.comp-ph,physics.chem-ph,physics.plasm-ph","published":"2025-04-08T13:27:26Z"}

Additionally, unimodular waveforms are preferred due to hardware\nlimitations. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular\nwaveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift\nregion, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with\nexisting methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane\nby using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization\nproblem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts\nobserved in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous\nrather than discrete. The problem of interest is formulated as an optimization\nproblem with infinite constraints along with unimodular constraints. To the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been studied yet. We\npropose to reformulate a non-convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) to a\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) with a finite number of constraints and a\nrank-one constraint, which is then solved by the sequential rank-one constraint\nrelaxation (SROCR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing methods in achieving a lower PSL of AF over a\ncontinuous Doppler frequency shift region of interest. Moreover, the designed\nwaveform can effectively prevent false alarms when detecting a target with an\narbitrary velocity.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-08T13:37:22Z"}

In a way, such methods can\nresemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally\nassuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating\nPreferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing\npromising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method\nmimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences\nrather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such,\nPIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially\ntaking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness\npressure.

Simple\ntime-series statistics such as variance or autocorrelation can be taken as\nproxies for the phenomenon, making their increase a useful early warning signal\n(EWS) for catastrophic regime shifts. However, the modelling basis justifying\nthe use of these EWSs is usually a finite-dimensional stochastic ordinary\ndifferential equation, where a mathematical proof for the aptness is possible.\nOnly recently has the phenomenon of CSD been proven to exist in\ninfinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), which\nare more appropriate to model real-world spatial systems. In this context, we\nprovide an essential extension of the results for SPDEs under a specific noise\nforcing, often referred to as red noise. This type of time-correlated noise is\nomnipresent in many physical systems, such as climate and ecology. We approach\nthe question with a mathematical proof and a numerical analysis for the\nlinearised problem. We find that also under red noise forcing, the aptness of\nEWSs persists, supporting their employment in a wide range of applications.\nHowever, we also find that false or muted warnings are possible if the noise\ncorrelations are non-stationary. We thereby extend a previously known\ncomplication with respect to red noise and EWSs from finite-dimensional\ndynamics to the more complex and realistic setting of SPDEs.","main_category":"math.PR","categories":"math.PR,math.DS","published":"2025-04-08T16:41:34Z"}

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.

MPNs\nenhance dynamic adaptability and resource management, while NDTs enable\nreal-time simulation, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making.\nTheir integration into 3GPP Release 20 will be instrumental in shaping a\nflexible and future-proof mobile ecosystem. These innovations exemplify how\nresearch-driven solutions can align with 6G standardization objectives. By\napplying the proposed methodology, we aim to establish a systematic pathway for\ntransitioning research into impactful 3GPP contributions, ultimately driving\nthe evolution of next-generation networks.","main_category":"cs.NI","categories":"cs.NI,cs.ET","published":"2025-04-09T08:39:38Z"}

G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a\nhigh-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of\nthe few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on\nscales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric\nobservations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete\nthe study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming\nregion, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope $850\n\\mu$m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial\nresolution of $\\sim$0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field\nin the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC\nfrom $\\sim$50,000 au to $\\sim$260 au scales. The large-scale ($\\sim$5 pc)\norientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent\nwith that observed at the core ($\\sim$4,000 au) and circumstellar ($\\sim$260\nau) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these\ndifferent scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster,\nwhose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the\ngravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic\nfield strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the\nDavis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04--0.09 mG.

Since outdoor environments represent the primary application\nscenario for mobile communications, this paper presents the first comprehensive\nreview and summary of multi-scenario and multi-frequency channel\ncharacteristics based on extensive outdoor new mid-band channel measurement\ndata, including UMa, UMi, and O2I. Specifically, a survey of the progress of\nthe channel characteristics is presented, such as path loss, delay spread,\nangular spread, channel sparsity, capacity and near-field spatial\nnon-stationary characteristics. Then, considering that satellite communication\nwill be an important component of future communication systems, we examine the\nimpact of clutter loss in air-ground communications. Our analysis of the\nfrequency dependence of mid-band clutter loss suggests that its impact is not\nsignificant. Additionally, given that penetration loss is frequency-dependent,\nwe summarize its variation within the FR3 band.

It is expected that these states are related to\nMajorana bound states (MBSs) in longer chains and that the tunable nature of\nthis setup makes it a promising platform to study MBSs. However, realistic\nsystems can only host highly, but not perfectly, localized near-zero-energy\nstates, called imperfect PMMs. It has been shown that these imperfect PMMs can\nevolve into trivial states unrelated to MBSs when the chain is extended. Such\nstates are called false PMMs, whereas PMMs that evolve into MBSs in long chains\nare called true PMMs. Here, using a microscopic model of QD-superconductor\narrays, we consider properties of false PMMs and the circumstances under which\nthey appear. In two-site systems, we find that the origin of many false PMMs\ncan be related to zero-energy states occurring in the absence of\nsuperconductivity and we use this analytic understanding to characterize the\nfalse PMMs that are typical for different regions of parameter space. In\nthree-site systems, we show that false PMMs can occur via the same mechanism as\nfor two-site systems, but we also find them in regions of parameter space where\nthey are not predicted to exist, thus hinting that the physics of false PMMs\ncan be richer in longer chains.

This gap in understanding stems largely from the lack of\ntheoretical tools for analyzing their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. To address\nthis challenge, we develop a system of approximate master equations that\ncapture the behavior of local search algorithms in constraint satisfaction\nproblems. Our framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with the phase\ndiagrams of two paradigmatic algorithms: Focused Metropolis Search (FMS) and\ngreedy-WalkSAT (G-WalkSAT) for random 3-SAT. The equations not only confirm the\nnumerical observation that G-WalkSAT's algorithmic threshold is nearly\nparameter-independent, but also successfully predict FMS's threshold beyond the\nclustering transition. We also exploit these equations in a decimation scheme,\ndemonstrating that the computed marginals encode valuable information about the\nlocal structure of the solution space explored by stochastic algorithms.\nNotably, our decimation approach achieves a threshold that surpasses the\nclustering transition, outperforming conventional methods like Belief\nPropagation-guided decimation.

DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a\nlower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value\nsuggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where\ndomain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is\npresent. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the\nregions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature\nextraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove\nthe low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific\ninformation such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However,\nsince low-frequency components also contain important information such as\ncolor, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from\n0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential\ninformation. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features.

An in-context\ntrained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to\nidentify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based\nattention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid\ncell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching\nresults in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate\ncontrol between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in\nstate-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with\ndiverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative\nmetrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency,\nvisual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain\ntraining-free, image-based text-to-video generation.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-09T13:11:09Z"}

Due to the introduction of the quantum parameter $\\xi$, the BH equation\nof state splits into two branches. One branch reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS\ncase as $\\xi\\to0$, with its phase transition pressure lower than the critical\npressure; another branch's phase transition pressure is greater than the\ncritical pressure.

Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying\nthe edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different\nforgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included\nin the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we\npresent an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL).

We prove that any such\nmetric $g$ forces the universal cover $(\\tM, \\tg)$ to split isometrically as a\nRiemannian product $(\\Hyp, g_0) \\times (\\R, c^2 du^2)$, where $(\\Hyp, g_0)$ is\nthe hyperbolic plane equipped with a complete $\\pi_1(\\Sigma)$-invariant metric\nand $c>0$ is a constant. This affirmatively resolves the question and extends\nrigidity theorems known for flat tori and manifolds of non-positive curvature.\nWe present two proofs: the main proof relies on the analysis of Busemann\nfunctions associated with the lifted $S^1$-action, while an alternative proof\nutilizes Jacobi field analysis along the flow lines of the corresponding\nKilling field. Both approaches show that the absence of conjugate points\ncompels the horizontal distribution orthogonal to the Killing field flow to be\nparallel and integrable, leading to a global isometric splitting via the de\nRham theorem. Several geometric and dynamical consequences follow from this\nrigid structure.","main_category":"math.DG","categories":"math.DG","published":"2025-04-10T10:05:48Z"}

Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force\nexerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag\nforce can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron\nliquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in\nthe bilayer.

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during\ngraph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on\nthese new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm\nis effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In\nthis paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient\ndescent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph\nconvolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood\naggregation on interaction graphs.

The ability to accurately transmit and receive data is the basis for\nhigh-speed communications and precise sensing, where a fundamental requirement\nis an accurate in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) modulation. For sensing,\nimperfections in IQ modulation lead to two critical issues in the\nrange-Doppler-map (RDM) in form of an increased noise floor and the presence of\nghost objects, degrading the accuracy and reliability of the information in the\nRDM.

We propose two scenarios for\nthis problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for\ncrowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill\ntemporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario,\nrecruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing\ncapacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a\nlong-term employee acquisition strategy.

Our main results are threefold: First, by\nimposing physically realistic boundary conditions and viscosity constraints, we\nprove that the solutions of the system smust necessarily take the following\nsteady-state form $(\\rho,u,v,w,p)=(\\rho_s,0,v_s,0, p_s)$. These solutions are\ncharacterized by both geostrophic balance, given by $fv_s-\\frac{\\partial\np_s}{\\partial x}=\\rho_s\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x}$ and hydrostatic\nbalance, expressed as $-\\frac{\\partial p_s}{\\partial z}=\\rho_s\\frac{\\partial\n\\Psi}{\\partial z}$. Second, we establish that any steady-state solution\nsatisfying the conditions $\\nabla \\rho_s=\\delta (x,z)\\nabla \\Psi$ with\n$v_s(x,z)=a_0x+a_1$ is linearly unstable when the conditions\n$\\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}>0$ and $(f+\\alpha_0)\\leq 0$ are simultaneously\nsatisfied. This instability under the condition $\\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}>0$\ncorresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Third, although the\ninherent Rayleigh-Taylor instability could potentially amplify the velocity\naround unstable steady-state solutions (heavier density over lighter one), we\nrigorously demonstrate that for any sufficiently smooth initial data, the\nsolutions of the system asymptotically converge to a neighborhood of a\nsteady-state solution in which both the zonal and vertical velocity components\nvanish. Finally, under a moderate additional assumption, we demonstrate that\nthe system converges to a specific steady-state solution. In this state, the\ndensity profile is given by $\\rho=-\\gamma \\Psi+\\beta$, where $\\gamma$ and\n$\\beta$ are positive constants, and the meridional velocity $v$ depends solely\nand linearly on $x$ variable.","main_category":"math.AP","categories":"math.AP","published":"2025-04-15T03:10:27Z"}

Recent advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for causal discovery by providing\ndomain expert knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can\neffectively process observational data for causal discovery. In this work, we\nexplore the potential of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery by integrating\nobservational data for LLM-based reasoning. Specifically, we examine whether\nLLMs can effectively utilize observational data through two prompting\nstrategies: pairwise prompting and breadth first search (BFS)-based prompting.\nIn both approaches, we incorporate the observational data directly into the\nprompt to assess LLMs' ability to infer causal relationships from such data.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets show that incorporating observational data\nenhances causal discovery, boosting F1 scores by up to 0.11 point using both\npairwise and BFS LLM-based prompting, while outperforming traditional\nstatistical causal discovery baseline by up to 0.52 points. Our findings\nhighlight the potential and limitations of LLMs for data-driven causal\ndiscovery, demonstrating their ability to move beyond textual metadata and\neffectively interpret and utilize observational data for more informed causal\nreasoning.

Despite decades of work yielding efficient algorithmic\n(AL) solutions and, more recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, a clear\ncomparative understanding is elusive. This gap stems from the absence of a\nunified evaluation framework, standardized datasets, and accessible ground\ntruths, all of which hinder systematic analysis and fair benchmarking. To\novercome these barriers, we introduce BEACON: a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to rigorously evaluate both AL and ML-based subgraph counting methods.\nBEACON provides a standardized dataset with verified ground truths, an\nintegrated evaluation environment, and a public leaderboard, enabling\nreproducible and transparent comparisons across diverse approaches. Our\nextensive experiments reveal that while AL methods excel in efficiently\ncounting subgraphs on very large graphs, they struggle with complex patterns\n(e.g., those exceeding six nodes). In contrast, ML methods are capable of\nhandling larger patterns but demand massive graph data inputs and often yield\nsuboptimal accuracy on small, dense graphs. These insights not only highlight\nthe unique strengths and limitations of each approach but also pave the way for\nfuture advancements in subgraph counting techniques.

Methods and Materials: We used the RADCURE dataset,\nconsisting of 3,346 patients with H&N cancer treated with definitive\n(chemo)radiotherapy. A probabilistic BN was constructed to model dependencies\namong clinical, anatomical, and treatment variables. The Markov Blanket (MB) of\ntwo-year survival (SVy2) was extracted and used to train a logistic regression\nmodel. After excluding incomplete cases, a temporal split yielded a train/test\n(2,174/820) dataset using 2007 as the cutoff year. Model performance was\nassessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC), C-index, and Kaplan-Meier (KM)\nsurvival stratification. Model fit was further evaluated using a log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) test. Causal inference was performed using do-calculus\ninterventions on MB variables. Results: The MB of SVy2 included 6 clinically\nrelevant features: ECOG performance status, T-stage, HPV status, disease site,\nthe primary gross tumor volume (GTVp), and treatment modality. The model\nachieved an AUC of 0.65 and C-index of 0.78 on the test dataset, significantly\nstratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups (log-rank p < 0.01).

In diffusion-based T2V models, the attention mechanism is a\ncritical component. However, it remains unclear what intermediate features are\nlearned and how attention blocks in T2V models affect various aspects of video\nsynthesis, such as image quality and temporal consistency. In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth perturbation analysis of the spatial and temporal attention\nblocks of T2V models using an information-theoretic approach. Our results\nindicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing\nand layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and\nthe aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy\nattention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas\nlow-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame\nstructure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video\nquality and enable text-guided video editing. These methods rely entirely on\nlightweight manipulation of the attention matrices in T2V models. The efficacy\nand effectiveness of our methods are further validated through experimental\nevaluation across multiple datasets.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-16T12:37:08Z"}

Against nine\nstate-of-the-art methods on the HarmBench dataset with twelve LLMs (ten\nopen-source, two closed-source), RainbowPlus achieves an average ASR of 81.1%,\nsurpassing AutoDAN-Turbo by 3.9%, and is 9 times faster (1.45 vs. 13.50 hours).\nOur open-source implementation fosters further advancements in LLM safety,\noffering a scalable tool for vulnerability assessment.

By testing two different prompts and based on a customised error\ntypology, we compare ChatGPT annotations with human expert evaluations of\ntranslations produced by DeepL and ChatGPT itself.

In this paper, we introduce a simple nonlinear mapping to\ndetermine PID gains from three auxiliary parameters.

Using\nX-ray, ultraviolet and radio microwave data we found that the pre-flare energy\nrelease site was compact and localized in the vicinity of TC interaction of\nmagnetic structures near the polarity inversion line. The analysis indicates\nthat a pre-flare current sheet (CS) could be in this region. Good\ncorrespondence between the location of the pre-flare and flare emission sources\nvisible at the very beginning of the impulsive phase is shown. We found\nrelationship between dynamics of the energy release in the pre-flare CS and\nformation of the future flare eruptive structure. The growth of the magnetic\nflux rope was associated with activation of plasma emissions, flows and an\nincrease of UV radiation fluxes from the region where the pre-flare CS was\nlocated. The eruptive flux rope gradually grew due to feeding by magnetized\nplasma ejected from the reconnecting pre-flare CS. Finally, it is shown that\nthe most probable trigger of the eruption was a local fast microflare-like\nmagnetic reconnection in the pre-flare CS. Some local instability in the\npre-flare sheet could lead to a transition from the slow to fast reconnection\nregime. As a result, an ejection from the sheet was initiated and the eruptive\nflux rope lost its stability.

While inversion\ntypically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of\nthe dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of\ninterest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses\nsignificant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on\nmultiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single\nviewpoint.

We use\nthis theory to prove data-leak-free execution of core cryptographic routines\ncompiled from Bedrock2 C to RISC-V machine code, showing that the smooth\nspecification and proof experience omnisemantics provides for nondeterminism\nextends to constant-time properties in the same setting. We also study variants\nof the key program-compiler contract, highlighting pitfalls of tempting\nsimplifications and subtle consequences of how inputs to nondeterministic\nchoices are constrained. Our results are backed by modular program-logic and\ncompiler-correctness theorems, and they integrate into a neat end-to-end\ntheorem in the Coq proof assistant.","main_category":"cs.PL","categories":"cs.PL","published":"2025-04-22T03:12:31Z"}

Existing methods primarily\ntransfer traditional AF methods to encrypted tunnels directly, ignoring the\ncore obfuscation and re-encapsulation mechanism of encrypted tunnels, thus\nresulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose DecETT, a\ndual decouple-based semantic enhancement method for accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels. Specifically, DecETT improves AF under encrypted tunnels from two\nperspectives: app-specific feature enhancement and irrelevant tunnel feature\ndecoupling.Considering the obfuscated app-specific information in encrypted\ntunnel traffic, DecETT introduces TLS traffic with stronger app-specific\ninformation as a semantic anchor to guide and enhance the fingerprint\ngeneration for tunnel traffic. Furthermore, to address the app-irrelevant\ntunnel feature introduced by the re-encapsulation mechanism, DecETT is designed\nwith a dual decouple-based fingerprint enhancement module, which decouples the\ntunnel feature and app semantic feature from tunnel traffic separately, thereby\nminimizing the impact of tunnel features on accurate app fingerprint\nextraction. Evaluation under five prevalent encrypted tunnels indicates that\nDecETT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate AF under encrypted\ntunnels, and further demonstrates its superiority under tunnels with more\ncomplicated obfuscation. \\textit{Project page:\n\\href{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}{https://github.com/DecETT/DecETT}}","main_category":"cs.CR","categories":"cs.CR","published":"2025-04-22T03:34:22Z"}

In this\nreport, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a\nwide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on\ntemporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos\ncorresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent\nediting. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong\ntemporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain\nqueries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also\npresent the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video\nduration: significantly longer than existing temporal retrival datasets, 2)\nAudio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query\nlengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually\nannotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation\nover multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading\nproprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task,\nindicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-22T08:04:45Z"}

This variability is explained by radiative transfer\nand magnetic properties of the molecule. To investigate this phenomenon, a 3D\nmaser simulation is employed to study the SiO masers based on Zeeman splitting.\nWe demonstrate that the magnetic field direction affects maser polarization\nwithin small tubular domains with isotropic pumping, and yields results that\nare similar to those obtained from 1D modelling. This work also studies larger\nclouds with different shapes. We use finite-element domains with internal node\ndistributions to represent the maser-supporting clouds.

When the observer's view of the domain\nchanges, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and\nthe projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of\nsight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization.\nTherefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's\nmajor axis orientation and magnetic field direction.

While considerable\nliterature studies how humans trust AI agents, it is much less understood how\nLLM-based agents develop effective trust in humans. LLM-based agents likely\nrely on some sort of implicit effective trust in trust-related contexts (e.g.,\nevaluating individual loan applications) to assist and affect decision making.\nUsing established behavioral theories, we develop an approach that studies\nwhether LLMs trust depends on the three major trustworthiness dimensions:\ncompetence, benevolence and integrity of the human subject.

This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two\nsignificant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental\ncombustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation\nand analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs\naffect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models?\nTo this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and\nderived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an\neffective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for\nRCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM\ntests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM\nautoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression\ntemperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber.\nFurthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can\nbe introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming\nideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical\nkinetic models.

One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI)\ntechnology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this\nchallenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active\nelements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles,\nconsidering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The\nrelationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking\ninto account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form\ndistribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear\napproximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form\nexpressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit\ntheorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are\nvalidated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the\nrandom fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance\nof UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should\nutilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As\na result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS\nsystems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in\nUAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the\noptimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-23T10:59:03Z"}

To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses\ndrive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish\nbetween compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical\nshortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot\ndistinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and\ncrack-parallel stresses that do not.\n  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our\nearlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel\nstresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic\nformulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past\neach other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces\ncontact under normal compressive loads.

People tend to show a higher preparedness level for the second TC but\nare more sensitive to the increasing forecast wind speed of the first TC. We\nalso find that the counties showing high preparedness levels for the first TC\nconsistently show high preparedness levels for the subsequent one. Power\noutages induced by the first TC significantly increase preparedness for the\nsubsequent TC (e.g., approximately 13% pct for mobility needs preparedness and\n24% for structural reinforcement preparedness when increasing one-unit\ncustomers out). We identified spatial dependency in preparedness across\ncounties. Power outage experiences in first TCs show statistically significant\nspillover effects on neighboring counties' preparedness levels for second TCs.\nThroughout sequential TCs, people with access and functional needs consistently\nshow lower preparedness levels.","main_category":"physics.soc-ph","categories":"physics.soc-ph","published":"2025-04-23T16:54:22Z"}

Gonzalez gave a classification of almost contact\nmetric manifolds into $2^{12}$ classes, based on the behaviour of the covariant\nderivative $\\nabla^g\\Phi$ of the fundamental $2$-form $\\Phi$. This large number\nmakes it difficult to deal with this class of manifolds. We propose a new\napproach to almost contact metric manifolds by introducing two intrinsic\nendomorphisms $S$ and $h$, which bear their name from the fact that they are,\nbasically, the entities appearing in the intrinsic torsion. We present a new\nclassification scheme for them by providing a simple flowchart based on\nalgebraic conditions involving $S$ and $h$, which then naturally leads to a\nregrouping of the Chinea-Gonzalez classes, and, in each step, to a further\nrefinement, eventually ending in the single classes. This method allows a more\nnatural exposition and derivation of both known and new results, like a new\ncharacterization of almost contact metric manifolds admitting a characteristic\nconnection in terms of intrinsic endomorphisms.

We try and understand what Bunyakovsky did, why he did it, why\nothers did not follow the same path, and explore some of the mathematical\n(re)interpretations of his inequalities. This is achieved by treating the texts\nas discourses that provide motivation and proofs by their very discursive\nstructure, in addition to what meets the eye at first reading. Bunyakovsky\npaper is an outgrowth of the mathematical theory of mean-values in Cauchy's\nwork (1821), but viewed from the point of view of Probability and Statistics.\nLiouville (1836) gave a result that implies Bunyakovsky's inequality, but did\nnot identify it as significant because his interests lay elsewhere. Grassmann\n(1862) stated the inequality in abstract form but did not prove it for reasons\nthat can be identified. Finally, by relating the result to quadratic binary\nforms, Schwarz (1885) opened the way to a geometric interpretation of the\ninequality that became important in the theory of integral equations. His\nargument is the source of one of the proofs most commonly taught nowadays. At\nabout the same time, the Rogers-H{\\\"o}lder inequality suggested generalizations\nof Cauchy's and Bunyakovsky's results in an entirely different direction.

Our study aims to investigate\nthe intrinsic polarization due to the rotational distortion of WR winds\nconsidering multiple scattering of photons and compare it to a\nsingle-scattering model, where we use an analytical expression of the\npolarization. We study the polarization signatures resulting from the prolate\nstructure of rotating winds of two WR stars using a 3D Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer code Hyperion. We estimated the intrinsic polarization resulting from\nmultiple scattering in WR winds for different rotational velocities,\ninclination angles, and mass-loss rates.

With detections of carbon- and\noxygen-bearing species such as CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O, a central\nquestion is whether the atmospheric C/O ratio, commonly used to trace formation\nlocation in giant planets, can serve a similar diagnostic role for\nsub-Neptunes. We use the global chemical equilibrium framework of Schlichting &\nYoung (2022) to quantify how magma ocean-atmosphere interactions affect the\natmospheric C/O ratio. We find that the resulting C/O ratios range from several\norders of magnitude below solar to a few times solar. The atmospheric C/O ratio\nin sub-Neptunes is therefore not inherited from the protoplanetary disk, but\ninstead emerges from chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the\nunderlying magma ocean. Planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and thermal\nstate all strongly influence the atmospheric C/O ratio. In addition, carbon\npartitioning into the metal phase typically reduces the atmospheric C/O ratio\nsubstantially, particularly for atmospheric mass fractions less than a few\npercent. Finally, we couple the deep equilibrium compositions to 1D atmospheric\nmodels that self-consistently solve for the pressure-temperature structure and\nchemical composition, including photochemistry. We find that the C/O ratio\nvaries with altitude under low vertical mixing conditions (K$_\\text{zz}=10^4$\ncm$^2$s$^{-1}$), but remains constant under strong mixing (K$_\\text{zz}=10^7$\ncm$^2$s$^{-1}$). Our results imply that observed C/O ratios of sub-Neptunes can\nbe used to probe their interiors. Specifically, C/O ratios much lower than host\nstar values would imply an underlying magma ocean with iron metal having\nsequestered significant amounts of carbon.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP","published":"2025-04-29T05:53:42Z"}

A\nfundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user\npreferences from conversations. User preferences can be multifaceted and\ncomplex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with\naccess to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify\ntheir true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user\nexperience.\n  To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated\nuser, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user\nprovides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better\ncapture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by\ngenerative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the\nsimulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained\nfeedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained\nfeedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified\ninto an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified\nsimulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated\nuser, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted.\nFurthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw\ninspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning\ntasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we\npropose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation\nresults derived from interaction.

However, recent\nstudies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial\nattacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\ndegree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is\nadopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of\ngraph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and\ndebiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CR","published":"2025-04-29T15:19:05Z"}

This\nrelation exhibits small scatter, thus providing key constraints for models of\ngalaxy formation and evolution -- allowing us to map the distribution of dark\nmatter in galaxies -- as well as models of modified dynamics. However, it has\nonly been extensively studied in the very local Universe with largely\nheterogeneous samples. We present a new measurement of the RAR, utilising a\nhomogeneous, unbiased sample of H{\\sc i}-selected galaxies. We introduce a\nnovel approach of measuring resolved stellar masses using spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting across 10 photometric bands to determine the\nresolved mass-to-light ratio, which we show is essential for measuring the\nacceleration due to baryons in the low-acceleration regime.

Because high noise levels are associated\nwith recovering large-scale image structures and low noise levels with\nrecovering details, this configuration can result in low-quality and blurry\nimages. However, it should be possible to improve details while spending fewer\nsteps recovering structures because the latent code should already contain\nstructural information. Based on this insight, we propose a new DAE training\nmethod that improves the quality of reconstructed images. We divide training\ninto two phases. In the first phase, the DAE is trained as a vanilla\nautoencoder by always setting the noise level to the highest, forcing the\nencoder and decoder to populate the latent code with structural information. In\nthe second phase, we incorporate a noise schedule that spends more time in the\nlow-noise region, allowing the DAE to learn how to perfect the details. Our\nmethod results in images that have accurate high-level structures and low-level\ndetails while still preserving useful properties of the latent codes.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-30T07:00:33Z"}

It uses an\ninfinitary language that allows for countable conjunctions and disjunctions. It\nis based on a set of nine syntactic rules of inductive inference, and contains\nclassical first-order logic as a special case. We also provide natural,\nprobabilistic semantics, and prove both $\\sigma$-compactness and completeness.\n  We show that the whole of measure-theoretic probability theory is embedded in\nthis system of inductive logic. The semantic models of inductive logic are\nprobability measures on sets of structures. (Structures are the semantic models\nof finitary, deductive logic.) Moreover, any probability space, together with a\nset of its random variables, can be mapped to such a model in a way that gives\neach outcome, event, and random variable a logical interpretation. This\nembedding, however, is proper. There are scenarios that are expressible in this\nsystem of logic which cannot be formulated in a measure-theoretic probability\nmodel.\n  The principle of indifference is an idea originating with Laplace. It says,\nroughly, that if we are \"equally ignorant\" about two possibilities, then we\nshould assign them the same probability. The principle of indifference has no\nrigorous formulation in probability. It exists only as a heuristic. Moreover,\nits use has a problematic history and is prone to apparent paradoxes. Within\ninductive logic, however, we formulate it rigorously and illustrate its use\nthrough a number of examples.\n  Many of the ideas in inductive logic have counterparts in measure theory. The\nprinciple of indifference, however, does not. Its formulation requires the\nstructure of inductive logic, both its syntactic structure and the semantic\nstructures embedded in its models. As such, it exemplifies the fact that\ninductive logic is a strictly broader theory of probability than any that is\nbased on measure theory alone.","main_category":"math.PR","categories":"math.PR,math.LO","published":"2025-04-30T11:16:21Z"}

In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses\nimplicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.\nHowever, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified\nbackdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic\ngradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a\nsample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training\nsets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the\npredictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust\nprediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become\ninapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To\nconquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification\nmethod, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve\ncertification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Quantization effectively compresses these models,\nreducing storage size and energy cost. However, in modern depthwise-separable\narchitectures, the computational cost is distributed unevenly across its\ncomponents, with pointwise operations being the most expensive. By applying a\ngeneral quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing\nquantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To\nthis end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern\ndepthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct\nbit-widths. Specifically, pointwise convolutions are quantized to ternary\nweights, while the remaining modules use 8-bit weights, which is achieved\nthrough a simple quantization-aware training procedure. Additionally, by\nquantizing activations to 8-bit, our method transforms pointwise convolutions\nwith ternary weights into int8 additions, which enjoy broad support across\nhardware platforms and effectively eliminates the need for expensive\nmultiplications. Applying PROM to MobileNetV2 reduces the model's energy cost\nby more than an order of magnitude (23.9x) and its storage size by 2.7x\ncompared to the float16 baseline while retaining similar classification\nperformance on ImageNet. Our method advances the Pareto frontier for energy\nconsumption vs. top-1 accuracy for quantized convolutional models on ImageNet.\nPROM addresses the challenges of quantizing depthwise-separable convolutional\nnetworks to both ternary and 8-bit weights, offering a simple way to reduce\nenergy cost and storage size.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-05-06T07:32:24Z"}

Frequency\nconversion is usually achieved by quasi-phase matching (QPM) via electric-field\npoling. However, this scheme shows very high sensitivity to the dimensions of\nthe waveguide, poling period and duty cycle, resulting in a lack of\nrepeatability of the phase matched wavelength and efficiency, which in turn\nlimits the spread of TFLN frequency converters in complex circuits and hinders\nwafer-scale production.

These\nconstraints arise due to the presence of bright objects in space that may\ndamage sensitive payloads onboard the spacecraft, and the risk that actuator\nsaturations may compromise closed-loop system stability. Furthermore,\nspacecraft attitude dynamics are typically affected by parametric\nuncertainties, external disturbances, and system nonlinearities, which cannot\nbe neglected. In this article, the problem of spacecraft reorientation under\npointing and actuation constraints is addressed using a strategy that combines\nArtificial Potential Field (APF) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC).

In this paper, we attribute the\nlimited generalization ability to two key factors: covariate shift, which\narises from external data collection variations, and semantic shift, which\nresults from substantial differences in emerging attack types. To address both\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach for learning unknown spoof prompts,\nrelying solely on real face images from a single source domain. Our method\ngenerates textual prompts for real faces and potential unknown spoof attacks by\nleveraging the general knowledge embedded in vision-language models, thereby\nenhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen target domains.\nSpecifically, we introduce a diverse spoof prompt optimization framework to\nlearn effective prompts. This framework constrains unknown spoof prompts within\na relaxed prior knowledge space while maximizing their distance from real face\nimages. Moreover, it enforces semantic independence among different spoof\nprompts to capture a broad range of spoof patterns.

In this paper we measure the bias\nparameters and other EFT coefficients from samples of two types of star-forming\ngalaxies in the state-of-the-art MilleniumTNG and Astrid hydrodynamical\nsimulations.

The electronics used in extreme edge applications\nmust be power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low\ncost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather\nthan silicon-based electronics, will be capable of meeting these qualities. For\nthis purpose, we propose a methodology to generate RISPs (RISC-V instruction\nsubset processors) customised to extreme edge applications and to implement\nthem as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology is unique in\nthe sense that verification is an integral part of design. The RISP methodology\ntreats each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional,\npre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by\nstitching together the hardware blocks of the instructions required by an\napplication or a set of applications in a specific domain. This approach\nsignificantly reduces the processor verification and its time-to-market. We\ngenerate RISPs using this methodology for three extreme edge applications, and\nembedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite, synthesize them as\nFlexICs, and compare their power, performance and area to the baselines. Our\nresults show that RISPs generated using this methodology achieve, on average,\n30\\% reductions in power and area compared to a RISC-V processor supporting the\nfull instruction set when synthesized, and are nearly 30 times more energy\nefficient with respect to Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor.\nIn addition, the full physical implementation of RISPs show up to 21% and 26%\nless area and power than Serv.","main_category":"cs.AR","categories":"cs.AR,cs.ET","published":"2025-05-07T17:03:06Z"}

As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not\nonly dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also\nrespond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic\ninteraction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the\nmodel we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,\ncoherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the\nsubjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated\ninteraction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human\ncommunication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model\noutperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more\npowerful support for effective communication.","main_category":"cs.GR","categories":"cs.GR,cs.CV,cs.SD,eess.AS","published":"2025-05-08T07:00:58Z"}

However, CD of chiral\nnatural materials is inherently constrained owing to molecular symmetry and\nthermodynamic stability. Recently, artificially engineered metasurfaces\nincorporating chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BICs) have emerged\nas a promising solution, which enables near-unity CD responses. However, their\ncurrent designs heavily rely on complex three-dimensional geometries, posing\nsignificant challenges for integration with planar on-chip platforms. To\naddress the stringent challenges, we demonstrate a truly planar metasurface\nthat achieves giant intrinsic chiral responses by utilizing a chiral Q-BIC\ndominated by out-of-plane toroidal dipoles (Tz). With deep-subwavelength\n({\\lambda}/20) thickness, our metasurface exhibits outstanding intrinsic CD\nvalues in both simulations (>0.90) and experiments (~0.80). Moreover, in\ncontrast to previous electric or magnetic chiral Q-BICs, the toroidal Q-BIC\nproduces a rapidly switching CD response - transitioning sharply between\npositive and negative giant CD values within ~0.2 GHz, and the switching is\nhighly sensitive to small oblique incidence of opposite angles. Therefore, our\nscheme provides a planar platform for studying chiral light-matter interactions\ninvolving toroidal dipoles, important for future development of polarization-\nand angle-sensitive photonic and optoelectronic devices.","main_category":"physics.optics","categories":"physics.optics","published":"2025-05-08T07:07:31Z"}

Advanced bundle\nrecommendation models usually learn bundle representations from multiple views\n(e.g., interaction view) at both the bundle and item levels. Consequently, the\ncold-start problem for bundles is more challenging than that for traditional\nitems due to the dual-level multi-view complexity. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Mixture of Diffusion Experts (MoDiffE) framework, which employs a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy for cold-start bundle recommendation and follows\nthree steps:(1) Divide: The bundle cold-start problem is divided into\nindependent but similar sub-problems sequentially by level and view, which can\nbe summarized as the poor representation of feature-missing bundles in\nprior-embedding models. (2) Conquer: Beyond prior-embedding models that\nfundamentally provide the embedded representations, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based method to solve all sub-problems in a unified way, which\ndirectly generates diffusion representations using diffusion models without\ndepending on specific features. (3) Combine: A cold-aware hierarchical Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) is employed to combine results of the sub-problems for final\nrecommendations, where the two models for each view serve as experts and are\nadaptively fused for different bundles in a multi-layer manner. Additionally,\nMoDiffE adopts a multi-stage decoupled training pipeline and introduces a\ncold-start gating augmentation method to enable the training of gating for cold\nbundles. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that MoDiffE significantly outperforms existing solutions in\nhandling cold-start bundle recommendation.

The first obstacle\nwhen trying to establish such an alignment is that a performance realizes one\n(out of many) structural versions of the score that can plausibly result from\ninstructions such as repeats, variations, and navigation markers like 'dal\nsegno/da capo al coda'. A score needs to be unfolded, that is, its repeats and\nnavigation markers need to be explicitly written out to create a single\ntimeline without jumps matching the performance, before alignment algorithms\ncan be applied. In the curation of large performance corpora this process is\ncarried out manually, as no tools are available to infer the repeat structure\nof the performance. To ease this process, we develop a method to automatically\ninfer the repeat structure of a MIDI performance, given a symbolically encoded\nscore including repeat and navigation markers. The intuition guiding our design\nis: 1) local alignment of every contiguous section of the score with a section\nof a performance containing the same material should receive high alignment\ngain, whereas local alignment with any other performance section should accrue\na low or zero gain.

The fundamental distinction\nbetween these approaches lies in the duration prediction strategy employed for\npredictable-length sequences. The NAR methods ensure stability in speech\ngeneration by explicitly and independently modeling the duration of each\nphonetic unit. Conversely, AR methods employ an autoregressive paradigm to\npredict the compressed speech token by implicitly modeling duration with Markov\nproperties.

This question found only negative answers: there is no\nfinite axiomatisation for the calculus of relations and many of its fragments,\nas shown later by several no-go theorems. In this paper we show that -- by\nmoving from traditional syntax (cartesian) to a diagrammatic one (monoidal) --\nit is possible to have complete axiomatisations for the full calculus. The\nno-go theorems are circumvented by the fact that our calculus, named the\ncalculus of neo-Peircean relations, is more expressive than the calculus of\nrelations and, actually, as expressive as first-order logic.

All the films, irrespective of\ntheir disorder, exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and significant drop in\nresistivity, crossover from asymmetric to symmetric magnetoresistance, and a\nsharp increase in MR around 300 K, confirming the occurrence of a\nthermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation. Detailed analysis of\nresistivity data indicates that for TS200 and TS350 films, a SGS based two\nchannel model describes the conductivity in the martensite phase, whereas\nTS450, TS500, and TS550 films, exhibit a usual metallic behavior with a\nresistivity minimum at low temperatures.

Our analysis differs\nfrom earlier, related, studies by treating the case where the dilaton's\ncouplings to matter are large enough to require screening to avoid unacceptable\ndilaton-mediated forces in the solar system. We use a recently proposed\nscreening mechanism that exploits the interplay between\nstronger-than-gravitational axion-matter couplings with the 2-derivative\naxion-dilaton interactions to suppress the couplings of the dilaton to bulk\nmatter.
