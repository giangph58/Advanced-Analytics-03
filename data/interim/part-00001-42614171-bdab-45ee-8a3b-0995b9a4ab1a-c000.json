However, existing\ncell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary\ndomain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources\n(i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance.\nAlthough incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often\nexacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts. In this work, we\nintroduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model\n(AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these\nobstacles through two key innovations. First, we propose a Conditional Gradient\nReversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features\nfrom diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while\npreserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset. Second, we\naddress SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution\nDecoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in\norder to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology\nimages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM\nfor multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation.\nWe validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating\nconsistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-03-27T16:59:39Z"}

We say that a series is commutative if the\nvalue in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input.\nThe commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite\npresentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it\nis commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has\nnot been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.\n  We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that\nconstitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's\nvarieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series,\nintroduced by Sch\\\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective\n(pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.\n  In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of\nformal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata,\nshuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these\nmodels recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their\ncommutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it\nremarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such\ndisparate computation models.\n  Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of\nformal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power\nseries for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential\nequations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks\nto this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive\nsequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are\neffective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.","main_category":"cs.FL","categories":"cs.FL,cs.DM,cs.LO","published":"2025-03-27T17:01:19Z"}

Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature\nin the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected\nregions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the\ntime-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources\ncould be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two\nmethods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio\ninterferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nimaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct\nthree-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the\nvisibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by\ncross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed\nvisibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the\nvisibility equation in the near field. We also develop a full polarization\nsimulation framework for RFI and demonstrate the methods on simulated\nobservations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced\nby these algorithms are investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms\nare applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral,\nand temporal characterization of two local RFI sources.

This enhancement arises\nfrom the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional\nplane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion\ndriven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous\nmeridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings.

Therefore, they need to\nconstantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A\nparticular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers\ncontinuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods\nneed constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby\nlimiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning\nmethods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML)\npractices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining\nprior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is\nstill scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual\ngraph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into\nreplay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within\nthe graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental\nevaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the\neffect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that\ncontinual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of\nextreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key\nchallenges and propose directions for future research.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-03-31T16:06:47Z"}

Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and\nsound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional\ndiffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a\nfeature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds.

Models predict that quasi-spherical winds, expelled by the\nblack hole during active accretion phases, have a key role in shaping galaxy\nevolution by regulating star formation, the distribution of metals over\nkiloparsec scales, and by sweeping ambient gas to the outskirts and beyond of\ngalaxies. Nonetheless, the mechanism driving these outflows and the amount of\nenergy exchanged between the wind and the galaxy's interstellar medium remain\nunclear. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the kinematical properties of\nwinds in a sample of nearby active galaxies using the novel kinematic tool\nMOKA3D, which takes into account the clumpy nature of the ISM. We find\nremarkable similarities among the properties of the outflows in all the\ngalaxies examined. In particular, we provide the first evidence that outflows\nexhibit a regular trend in radial velocity, initially constant or slightly\ndecreasing, followed by rapid acceleration starting at approximately 1 kpc from\nthe nucleus, despite the seemingly complex kinematics observed. The observed\nbehavior aligns with our current theoretical understanding of Active Galactic\nNuclei outflows, where a momentum-driven phase transitions to an\nenergy-conserving phase just beyond approximately 1 kpc. The constant velocity\nof the momentum-driven wind is then rapidly accelerated following the\ninefficient Compton cooling of post-shock material and the transition to energy\nconservation.

However, most of these results rely on the assumption that\nthe principal has an unlimited budget for incentivizing agents, an assumption\nthat is often unrealistic in practice. This motivates the study of the optimal\ncontract problem under budget constraints. We study multi-agent contracts with\nbudget constraints under both binary and combinatorial actions. For binary\nactions, our contribution is threefold. First, we generalize all previously\nknown approximation guarantees on the principal's revenue to budgeted settings.\nSecond, through the lens of budget constraints, we uncover insightful\nconnections between the standard objective of the principal's revenue and other\nobjectives. We identify a broad class of objectives, which we term BEST\nobjectives, including reward, social welfare, and revenue, and show that they\nare all equivalent (up to a constant factor), leading to approximation\nguarantees for all BEST objectives. Third, we introduce the price of frugality,\nwhich quantifies the loss due to budget constraints, and establish near-tight\nbounds on this measure, providing deeper insights into the tradeoffs between\nbudgets and incentives. For combinatorial actions, we establish a strong\nnegative result. Specifically, we show that in a budgeted setting with\nsubmodular rewards, no finite approximation is possible to any BEST objective.\nThis stands in contrast to the unbudgeted setting with submodular rewards,\nwhere a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation is known for revenue. On\nthe positive side, for gross substitutes rewards, we recover our binary-actions\nresults, obtaining a constant-factor approximation for all BEST objectives.","main_category":"cs.GT","categories":"cs.GT","published":"2025-04-02T14:32:39Z"}

We find that when the planetary field is\nnot too strong, the planetary magnetosphere is pushing against the CME,\nincreasing its density so the radio burst is visible at higher frequencies.\nWhen the planetary field is very strong, the large magnetosphere does not leave\nroom for the CME shock to evolve so the radio burst is more visible in the\nlower frequencies associated with the weak compression at the flanks of the CME\nshock.

Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has\nbecome an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital\npathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features\nmay not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their\nlack of interpretability limits clinical adoption.\n  In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision\nTransformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)\nto enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction\nusing WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is\nselected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using\nGoogle's pre-trained ViT.

The\napplications in nuclear environments require radiation resistance. The\ncharacteristics of Ge-doped MM fibers are investigated for Radiation Induced\nAttenuation (RIA) in Total Ionizing Dose (TID).\n  Methods: Commercial samples of Ge-doped MM fibers were irradiated in Go-60\ngamma rays at dose rates of 5 to 1.4k Gy(SiO2)/hr. The fiber samples were\npackaged in water tanks maintained at constant temperatures in the range of -15\nto 45 degC. The optical power transmitted through the fibers were recorded in\nirradiation, and in annealing when the source was shielded. The measurements of\nRIA in time are analyzed for dose rate and temperature dependences.\n  Results: Ge-doped fiber samples of OM2 to OM4 grades were investigated for\nattenuation of optical power in radiation ionizing dose. Depending on the\nfabrication technology, two of the fiber types show radiation resistance with\nthe RIAs of 0.2 dB/m and 0.05 dB/m, respectively, for the TID of 300 kGy(SiO2).\nAt low dose rate of 5 Gy/hr, the RIA increases steadily and the annealing of\nlow density ionizing defects does not cause notable deviation.

However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely\nused in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or\ndynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or\nevent-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur,\nenhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse\nlighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these\nadvantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using\nDVS for detecting civil structural defects.Moreover, there is no dedicated\nevent-based dataset tailored for this purpose.

For the field of systems and control, neuromorphic controllers\ncould potentially bring many benefits, but their advancement is hampered by\nlack of systematic analysis and design tools. In this paper, the objective is\nto show that hybrid systems methods can aid in filling this gap. We do this by\nformally analyzing rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum system, which\nwas recently proposed as a prototypical setup.

However, doing\nso requires careful consideration of amplifier saturation as well as the\nvariable light shifts that result. As such, we describe a method to calibrate\nand cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic virtual\nphase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a\nlinear scaling between $\\theta$ and the residual light shift. Once, we have\nconsidered and calibrated these effects, we demonstrate performance improvement\nwith decreasing $\\theta$. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware control to\ntransform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle M{\\o}lmer-S{\\o}rensen\ngate into a phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,physics.atom-ph","published":"2025-04-08T17:59:10Z"}

Specifically, GenSR consists of two main\nmodules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models\ncollaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item\nrepresentations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning\ntogether with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative\nparadigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its\nsuperiority from the mutual information perspective.","main_category":"cs.IR","categories":"cs.IR","published":"2025-04-09T09:15:37Z"}

The core challenge of this task is how to construct\na generalized feature space for novel categories with limited data on the basis\nof the base category space, which could adapt the learned detection model to\nunknown scenarios. However, limited by insufficient samples for novel\ncategories, two issues still exist: (1) the features of the novel category are\neasily implicitly represented by the features of the base category, leading to\ninseparable classifier boundaries, (2) novel categories with fewer data are not\nenough to fully represent the distribution, where the model fine-tuning is\nprone to overfitting. To address these issues, we introduce the side\ninformation to alleviate the negative influences derived from the feature space\nand sample viewpoints and formulate a novel generalized feature representation\nlearning method for FSOD.

In particular, we first introduce a\nMulti-Scale Edge Information Integration (MSEII) module to enhance edge\nperception and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregator (HiFA) to boost multi-scale\nobject detection in the encoder. Then, we adopt self-moving point\nrepresentations for continuous convolution and residual connection to\nefficiently extract irregular features under the scenarios of irregular point\ncloud data. To further mitigate cross-modal conflicts, an Adaptive Feature\nInteractive Fusion (AFIF) module is introduced to integrate visual and radar\nfeatures through geometric alignment and semantic fusion. Extensive experiments\non the WaterScenes dataset demonstrate that WS-DETR achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance, maintaining its superiority even under adverse weather and\nlighting conditions.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-10T04:16:46Z"}

In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that\nmakes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy\n(i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel\npatch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection.

Previous works generated class-agnostic\n\\textbf{\\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed\ncandidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning\n(MIL).

Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is\ncrucial for language models of different sizes and applications. One of the\nmost widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag;\nhowever, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues.\nThese issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading\nprompts or equally correct options. Furthermore, we show that if models are\nevaluated only on answer texts, or with \"Lorem ipsum dolor...\" instead of the\nquestion, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot\nbe attributed merely to contamination. Since benchmark scores are an essential\npart of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these\nvalidity issues can have severe consequences.

Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution\ncompression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can\nbe reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.

In\naddition to the previously described FLD$^{\\rm s}$ model with\nwavelength-averaged opacities, we present a multiband model mFLD$^{\\rm s}$,\nwhere the spectrum of thermal radiation is divided into several frequency\nbands. The model is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme for the\nequations of thermal radiation diffusion, which reduces to a system of linear\nalgebraic equations written in hypermatrix form. A modified Gauss method for\ninverting the sparse hypermatrix of the original system of linear equations is\nproposed.

Improving IMPT delivery efficiency reduces motion-related\nuncertainties, enhances plan robustness, and benefits breath-hold techniques by\nshortening treatment time. Among various factors, energy switching time plays a\ncritical role, making energy layer optimization (ELO) essential. This work\ndevelops an energy layer optimization method based on mixed integer model and\nvariational quantum computing algorithm to enhance the efficiency of IMPT. The\nenergy layer optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, where\ncontinuous variables optimize the dose distribution and binary variables\nindicate energy layer selection. To solve it, iterative convex relaxation\ndecouples the dose-volume constraints, followed by the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) to separate mixed-variable optimization and the\nminimum monitor unit (MMU) constraint. The resulting beam intensity subproblem,\nsubject to MMU, either admits a closed-form solution or is efficiently solvable\nvia conjugate gradient. The binary subproblem is cast as a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, solvable using variational\nquantum computing algorithms.

Most existing\nstudies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational\ncontexts.

By\ncombining optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, we develop a method\nto segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify density gradients.\nOur approach calculates two key metrics: the density gradient coefficient\n($\\alpha$) and the minimum effective distance (LD) at which density reaches a\ntarget threshold. We further employ machine learning techniques, specifically\nK-means clustering, to objectively identify uniform and high-variability\nregions within density gradient plots. We demonstrate that these metrics\nprovide an effective screening tool for public transport analyses by revealing\nthe underlying urban structure. Through comparative analysis of two\nrepresentative cities with contrasting urban morphologies (monocentric vs\npolycentric), we establish relationships between density gradient\ncharacteristics and public transport network topologies. Cities with clear\ndensity peaks in their gradient plots indicate distinct urban centers requiring\ndifferent transport strategies than those with more uniform density\ndistributions.

Reconstructing SoS\nimages from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle\ncomputed-tomography problem, with Variational Networks being a promising\nmodel-based deep learning solution. Some acquired data frames may, however, get\ncorrupted by noise due to, e.g., motion, lack of contact, and acoustic shadows,\nwhich in turn negatively affects the resulting SoS reconstructions.

The\nperiod of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are\nexplained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system,\none intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal).

Existing methods generally train pre-defined\nnetworks or subnetworks with capacities specifically designed for\npre-determined platforms, using compatible learning. Nevertheless, these\nmethods suffer from limited flexibility for multi-platform deployment. For\nexample, when introducing a new platform into the retrieval systems, developers\nhave to train an additional model at an appropriate capacity that is compatible\nwith existing models via backward-compatible learning. In this paper, we\npropose a Prunable Network with self-compatibility, which allows developers to\ngenerate compatible subnetworks at any desired capacity through post-training\npruning. Thus it allows the creation of a sparse subnetwork matching the\nresources of the new platform without additional training. Specifically, we\noptimize both the architecture and weight of subnetworks at different\ncapacities within a dense network in compatible learning. We also design a\nconflict-aware gradient integration scheme to handle the gradient conflicts\nbetween the dense network and subnetworks during compatible learning.

The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from\nthe time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked\nup to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional\nlattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\\alpha}$\nwith the distance $d$, for $\\alpha\\in(0,\\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays\nwith a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\\alpha$. At short\ntimes, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of\n$\\alpha$.

While such capabilities empower various creative\napplications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can\nexploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these\nthreats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial\nperturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization\nmodels. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image\nnature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying\nperturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This\nneglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger\nprivacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on\nprivacy protection against personalization. Specifically, we introduce\nCross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP), a novel framework that enhances\nresistance to personalization by enforcing style consistency across perturbed\nimages. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic ratio adjustment strategy that\nadaptively balances the impact of the consistency loss throughout the attack\niterations. Extensive experiments on the classical CelebHQ and VGGFace2\nbenchmarks show that CAP substantially improves existing methods.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-04-17T08:39:32Z"}

Existing\napproaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate\npipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly\nDetection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating\nlogical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny\nmultimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a\ntwo-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for\nfine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent,\nhuman-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the\ndetection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the\nneed for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the\nMVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller,\nmatches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further\nexcels in producing concise and interpretable rationales.

However, the diverse flight\nactivities associated with the emerging LAE applications in urban scenarios\nconfront complex physical environments, which urgently necessitates ubiquitous\nand reliable communication to guarantee the operation safety of the\nlow-altitude aircraft. As one of promising technologies for the sixth\ngeneration (6G) mobile networks, channel knowledge map (CKM) enables the\nenvironment-aware communication by constructing a site-specific dataset,\nthereby providing a priori on-site information for the aircraft to obtain the\nchannel state information (CSI) at arbitrary locations with much reduced online\noverhead.

For the critique generation\npart, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with\na broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first\nwrite a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a\nstep-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared\nwith those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many\ncases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results\nsuggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style\nbut also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided.

The aim of this study is to\nrefine the understanding of TOI-270 d and highlight considerations for JWST\ndata analysis.

Methods: We reduce one JWST NIRSpec G395H\nand one NIRISS SOSS GR700XD transit dataset using the Eureka! pipeline and a\ncustom MCMC-based light curve fitting algorithm at the instruments' native\nresolutions. The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR\nretrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions.\nResults: Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at\nthe red end of the NIRISS data.
