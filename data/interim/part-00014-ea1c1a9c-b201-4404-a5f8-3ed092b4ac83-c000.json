While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely\ncompensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult\nto tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and\nimplement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent\nexchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge.\nWe show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element\nwithout knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array.\nWe uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be\nlinked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate\nthe methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology\nshould be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor\nplatforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is\npresent or can be engineered.

Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair\npotentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i\nB_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \\neq k$),\nwhere these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group\n$D_{2h}$.

Slow\nconvergence limiting the use to small networks, and difficulty to train through\ngradient-descent methods because of the recurrent dynamics have hindered\nresearch on RNNs, yet their biological plausibility and their capability to\nmodel dynamical systems over simple functions makes then interesting for\ncomputational researchers.\n  Reservoir Computing emerges as a solution to these problems that RNNs\ntraditionally face. Promising to be both theoretically sound and\ncomputationally fast, Reservoir Computing has already been applied successfully\nto numerous fields: natural language processing, computational biology and\nneuroscience, robotics, even physics. This survey will explore the history and\nappeal of both traditional feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, before\ndescribing the theory and models of this new reservoir computing paradigm.\nFinally recent papers using reservoir computing in a variety of scientific\nfields will be reviewed.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-03T14:34:51Z"}

These\ndynamics have been thoroughly investigated in previous studies when the\ncritical point is crossed during the quench; here, we quench the system from\ndeep in the paramagnetic phase to just above the critical field so that the\nsystem remains in the gapped phase throughout the quench duration. On linearly\nquenching the infinitely large system, we find that the behavior of mean\nlongitudinal defect density and mean transverse magnetization at the end of the\nquench falls into three distinct scaling regimes as the quench time is\nincreased. For sufficiently small quench times, these observables remain\nroughly constant, but for larger quench times, a crossover occurs from the\nKibble-Zurek scaling law to the quadratic quench rate law when the Kibble-Zurek\ntime is of the order of relaxation time at the final quench field.

One\npopular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism\nknown as a dispute game for block proposals. In these systems, validators can\nchallenge blocks that they believe contain errors, and a successful challenge\nresults in the transfer of a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward.

Our analysis demonstrates that under current designs, the\ncompetitive pressure from validators may be insufficient to deter malicious\nbehavior.

PME, rooted in principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), not only identifies a reduced set of critical modes\nbut also re-parameterizes the original design space, enabling direct and\ninterpretable manipulations of shape modifications within the reduced space.\nAlongside the \"physics-informed\" version (PI-PME), which enriches geometry with\nlow-fidelity distributed and lumped physical quantities, a \"physics-driven\"\nvariant (PD-PME) is introduced that focuses exclusively on physical parameters.\nBoth formulations employ PCA to capture the principal modes of variability yet\ndiffer in their balance between geometric and physical information, through the\nad-hoc definition of a weighted inner product. Through test cases involving the\nRAE-2822 airfoil, a bio-inspired underwater glider, a naval propeller, and the\nDTMB-5415 destroyer-type vessel, it is shown how the resulting frameworks\nprovide a first-level assessment of design variability, offer interpretability\nregarding which original variables most strongly affect performance, and\nefficiently bridge geometric and physical parameters. Furthermore, lumped\nphysical parameters can serve as a low-fidelity foundation for multi-fidelity\noptimization, directly leveraging the linear re-parameterization to drive the\nreduced design variables. Meanwhile, distributed physical parameters enable the\nconstruction of machine-learning-based reduced-order models to infer integral\nquantities of interest. By allowing the user to embed these insights early in\nthe design process, PI-PME and PD-PME facilitate more robust, cost-effective\nexploration, paving the way for subsequent high-fidelity optimization.","main_category":"math.OC","categories":"math.OC","published":"2025-04-08T09:43:41Z"}

In this framework, the machine learning algorithm is guided by\nthe underlying physical laws, enabling the accurate extraction of the inverse\nscattering potential from the elastic scattering data. Methodology: As a\nreference potential, a combination of three smoothly joined Morse functions has\nbeen utilized, characterized by ten model parameters.

However, the emerging OWC networks require\na high number of optical access points (APs), each AP corresponding to an\noptical cell, to provide uniform coverage for multiple users. Therefore,\ninter-cell interference (ICI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are crucial\nissues that must be managed efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. In\nradio frequency (RF) networks, rate splitting (RS) is proposed as a\ntransmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously following a certain\nstrategy. It was shown that RS provides high data rates compared to orthogonal\nand non-orthogonal interference management schemes. Considering the high\ndensity of OWC networks, the application of RS within each optical cell might\nnot be practical due to severe ICI. In this paper, a new strategy is derived\nreferred to as blind interference alignment-rate splitting (BIA-RS) to fully\ncoordinate the transmission among the optical APs, while determining the\nprecoding matrices of multiple groups of users formed beforehand. Therefore, RS\ncan be implemented within each group to manage MUI. The proposed BIA-RS scheme\nrequires two layers of power allocation to achieve high performance.

The cause of such outbursts is\nbelieved to be thermal-viscous instability in the accretion disc. However, some\nof these transient sources show unusually long outbursts. For example, EXO\n0748-676 remained in outburst for at least 23 years before entering a\nquiescence, only to re-emerge 16 years later. We aim to investigate if such\nlong outbursts could be due to the usual disc instability, or if any other\nmechanism is required. In order to address this question, we systematically\ncompare various properties of long outburst and short outburst NS LMXBs. For\nthis, we analyze the long-term X-ray light curves of many short orbital period\n(hours) NS LMXBs, examining the outburst duration and the inferred accretion\nrate, and estimate the accretion disc mass. Our study shows that long outburst\nsources are well-separated from the short outburst ones in parameter spaces\ninvolving accretion rate, disc mass, outburst duration, etc. in four ways. This\nimplies that the thermal-viscous instability in the disc cannot explain the\nlong outbursts, but could explain the short ones. Moreover, we discuss that\nboth donor star related and disc related models have difficulties in explaining\nlong outbursts. Our finding will be crucial to understanding the accretion\nprocess of transiently accreting neutron stars and black holes.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-10T10:09:32Z"}

We first evaluate\ntraditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these\nmethods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error\naccumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the\ncommon practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as\npseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which\nexplicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the\noffline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.\nMoreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically\nfilter noisy labels of different classes.

Here, we present\nDynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM\nwith a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or\nre-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and\nreuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving\ninsights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance\nsubstantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth\nlabels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than\ndoubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across\nquestions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to\n99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks\nprone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o\nand Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated\ncode, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic\nchallenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks.\nClaude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro\nproblems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise,\ntransferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or\nstatic retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly,\nwithout modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC\nas a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the\ndivide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven\nlearning characteristic of human cognition.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.CL","published":"2025-04-10T17:57:33Z"}

The separate design of modules in\nAI-based CSI feedback architectures under traditional modular communication\nframeworks, including channel estimation (CE), CSI compression and feedback,\nleads to sub-optimal performance.

The non-sinusoidal sawtooth-like satellite\nwakes and azimuthally more localized vertical walls observed by Cassini are\nsimultaneously reproduced in the detailed structures and spatial scales. Both\nof them periodically vary due to the satellite excursions between the apocenter\nand the pericenter.

This does not mean that a PAD should be specifically\ndesigned for such users; that would imply the availability of many enrolled\nusers' PAI and, consequently, complexity, time, and cost increase. On the\ncontrary, we propose to equip a basic PAD, designed according to the state of\nthe art, with an innovative add-on module called the Closeness Binary Code (CC)\nmodule. The term \"closeness\" refers to a peculiar property of the bona\nfide-related features: in an Euclidean feature space, genuine fingerprints tend\nto cluster in a specific pattern.

Due to the\ninherent decoding ambiguity in DAC, the number of candidate paths grows\nexponentially with the increase in source length. To select the correct\ndecoding path from the set of candidates, DAC decoders utilize the Maximum A\nPosteriori (MAP) metric to rank the decoding sequences, outputting the path\nwith the highest MAP metric as the decoding result of the decoder.

Current research\npredominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D\nreconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the\nclinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to\nsupport real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG)\npresents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile\nsolution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent\nadvances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation\nfrom neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that\ntranslates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural\ndecoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an\nEEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large\nlanguage model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs,\nand leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize\nthe final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures\nsalient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.Our\ncode is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.","main_category":"cs.GR","categories":"cs.GR,cs.HC,eess.SP","published":"2025-04-16T10:16:03Z"}

Model-based approaches are\nparticularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and\ngeneralizability.

In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel\nmodel-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback\nfrom value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is\nlearned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned\ndirectly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform\ncomprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can\nlearn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing\nmethods. It offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into\nexisting model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model\naccuracy.

Built upon the classical Encoder-\nDistortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking\nmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark\nextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,\nallowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A\nlocalization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark\nregions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and\nimproving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask\ninto the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in\ndesignated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark\nextraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and\nmulti-watermark embedding.

We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY\nguidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces.\nLUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy\ndemonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training.

As a result,\nspecial residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep\nlearning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ\na denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the\ndata-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer\nlearning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1)\npre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the\ncomputer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the\npre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are\nupsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow\nstructures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser\neffectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion\nmodel reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV\nbaseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits\nenhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer\nlearning.

Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity\ntax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.\nAnalogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side\naccuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item\nfairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized\nusing the notion of elasticity.

By using replicator\ndynamics in an infinite well-mixed population we reveal that state-based\nfeedback plays a crucial role in alleviating the cooperative dilemma by\nenhancing and sustaining cooperation compared to the feedback-free case.\nMoreover, when the feedback strength is sufficiently strong or the baseline\nmultiplication factor is sufficiently high, the system with local\nstate-feedback provides full cooperation, hence supporting the ``think\nglobally, act locally'' principle. Besides, we show that the second-order\nfree-rider problem can be partially mitigated under certain conditions when the\nstate-feedback is employed.

While deep learning approaches have significantly improved\nperformance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their\ndeployment in real-time edge applications.

As a result, they are usually weak against unknown\ndistortions that are not used in their training pipeline. In this paper, we\npropose a novel watermarking framework to resist unknown distortions, namely\nAdversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW).

Standard deep\nlearning models often struggle with these challenges because their\narchitectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing\non general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

These mechanisms can be\nbroadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal\nshifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to\nreduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid\ndisparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel\ndisplacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform\nimplicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby\ncapturing a broader range of disparity information.

Can alternative reasoning paths yield different\nresults? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps,\ntermed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings.

The first strategy involves fusing audio and visual features at the\nbottleneck layer of the encoder, followed by processing the fused features\nthrough the decoder. However, when there is a significant disparity between the\ntwo modalities, this approach may lead to the loss of critical information. The\nsecond strategy avoids direct fusion and instead relies on the decoder to\nhandle the interaction between audio and visual features.

This paper develops a new\nmethod, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which\nprovides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events\nand which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main\nhypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto\nscale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the\ndistributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the\n$L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets\nlarge. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling\nof the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of\nthe angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to\nAitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a\nWasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new\nvalues. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives\nsimulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance\ncompared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of\ncapturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in\ngenerating accurate new extremes of the data distribution.

In the simulation results, double peaked profiles/profiles with two\nvalleys are observed at the divertor targets which can be explained by the\nparallel drift velocities These drifts move particles from the outboard towards\nthe inboard side and, in that way, also increase the ionization sources at the\ninboard side. It is shown that Ne+ leaks towards the core making it difficult\nto perform experiments which contain as much neon as in the SOLPS-ITER\nsimulations. In fact, the level of neon in the experiments is limited by the HL\nbacktransition which takes place if higher order states of neon ionize in the\ncore and cause in that way too much core radiation.

Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach,\nwhere agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations. However, IL\ncommonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks. Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL)\nachieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive\nfeedback from human teachers.

It can\nsystematically explore the execution paths of the tested program. But it\nsuffers from an inherent limitation: path explosion. Path explosion occurs when\nsymbolic execution encounters an overwhelming number (exponential to the\nprogram size) of paths that need to be symbolically reasoned. It severely\nimpacts the scalability and performance of symbolic execution. To tackle this\nproblem, previous works leverage various heuristics to prioritize paths for\nsymbolic execution. They rank the exponential number of paths using static\nrules or heuristics and explore the paths with the highest rank. However, in\npractice, these works often fail to generalize to diverse programs. In this\nwork, we propose a novel and effective path prioritization technique with path\ncover, named Empc. Our key insight is that not all paths need to be\nsymbolically reasoned. Unlike traditional path prioritization, our approach\nleverages a small subset of paths as a minimum path cover (MPC) that can cover\nall code regions of the tested programs. To encourage diversity in path\nprioritization, we compute multiple MPCs. We then guide the search for symbolic\nexecution on the small number of paths inside multiple MPCs rather than the\nexponential number of paths. We implement our technique Empc based on KLEE. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of Empc to investigate its performance in\ncode coverage, bug findings, and runtime overhead. The evaluation shows that\nEmpc can cover 19.6% more basic blocks than KLEE's best search strategy and\n24.4% more lines compared to the state-of-the-art work cgs.

In this\nresearch note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes\noscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism\nbetween them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and\nthreshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold\nunits model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate\ninformation exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between\nthese two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical\nsystems that admit Lyapunov functions.

The resulting dynamical systems\ncan be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model,\nwhich also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible.\nNotably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction\nto the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed\neither as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for\nfine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization\nof this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.","main_category":"q-bio.NC","categories":"q-bio.NC,cs.AI,cs.LG","published":"2025-05-06T15:54:52Z"}

This is primarily due to an overreliance on forgery artifacts and a\nlimited understanding of real faces. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel approach RealID to enhance generalization by learning a comprehensive\nconcept of real faces while assessing the probabilities of belonging to the\nreal and fake classes independently. RealID comprises two key modules: the Real\nConcept Capture Module (RealC2) and the Independent Dual-Decision Classifier\n(IDC). With the assistance of a MultiReal Memory, RealC2 maintains various\nprototypes for real faces, allowing the model to capture a comprehensive\nconcept of real class. Meanwhile, IDC redefines the classification strategy by\nmaking independent decisions based on the concept of the real class and the\npresence of forgery artifacts. Through the combined effect of the above\nmodules, the influence of forgery-irrelevant patterns is alleviated, and\nextensive experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate that RealID\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 1.74%\nimprovement in average accuracy.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-07T14:31:04Z"}

In this paper, we\nintroduce the concept of $p$-complete square-free word-representable graph\n$G(V,E)$. A word $w$ defined over alphabet $V$ is called $p$-complete\nsquare-free word if there does not exist any subset $S\\subseteq \\Sigma$ such\nthat the word $w_{S}$ contains a square $XX$ where $|X| \\ge p$ and $1\\le p \\le\n|w|/2$. A word-representable graph is considered $p$-complete square-free\nword-representable if there exists a $p$-complete square-free word-representant\nof that graph. This pattern is significant as it proves the existence of\npatterns that do not depend on graph labelling and cannot be avoided by certain\nclasses of word-representable graphs. The class of word-representable graphs\nincludes both $p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs and\nnon-$p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs. Additionally, this\nconcept generalises the square pattern found in the words. A word-representable\ngraph is $p$-complete square-free uniform word-representable if its\n$p$-complete square-free word-representant is a uniform word. We analyse the\nproperties of $p$-complete square-free uniform words and find that the graphs\nrepresented by these words avoid having $K_p$ (the complete graph on $p$\nvertices) as an induced subgraph. We provide classifications for small values\nof $p$: for $p=1$, only complete graphs and for $p=2$, only complete and\nedgeless graphs satisfy the condition. We find that $K_3$-free circle graphs\nare 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable. Furthermore, we\nestablish that only graphs with representation number at most 3 can be\n3-complete square-free uniform word-representable and provide a constructive\nmethod to generate such graphs.","main_category":"cs.DM","categories":"cs.DM,math.CO","published":"2025-05-08T10:21:12Z"}

In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates\nmodel performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen\nclasses (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to\nhandle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has\nspurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified\nevaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or\nnew domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2).\nWhat's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric\nshould be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3).
