This capability enables us to\npredict events, plan action and navigate environments, all of which rely on a\ncomposite sense of objecthood. Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully. Finally, we explore novel evaluation approaches that align with the\nintegrated vision of objecthood outlined in this paper. These methods are\npromising candidates for advancing from isolated object capabilities toward\ngeneral-purpose AI with genuine object understanding in real-world contexts.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.LG","published":"2025-03-27T16:35:02Z"}

The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their\npositions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could\nsignificantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this\npotential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional,\ncomplex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within\na rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and\ncrescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its\nplacement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant\nfrequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of\ninternal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node\ngeneration. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect\nratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the\nchannel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor,\nwhich is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic\nenergy per cycle. We show that additional nodes emerge in the presence of a\nscatterer, but they come at the cost of reduced acoustic pressure and energy in\nthe channel. In summary, this study provides information on generating complex\nnodes in a standing wave acoustic cavity at the fundamental frequency, which\nhas numerous applications for particle manipulation in acoustofluidic devices.","main_category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":"physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-03-27T17:24:41Z"}

Unlike\nthe extensively studied image domain, limited research has explored the threat\nof backdoor attacks on the reconstruction of symbols in semantic communication\n(SemCom) systems. Previous work has investigated such backdoor attacks at the\ninput level, but these approaches are infeasible in applications with strict\ninput control. In this paper, we propose a novel attack paradigm, termed\nChannel-Triggered Backdoor Attack (CT-BA), where the backdoor trigger is a\nspecific wireless channel. This attack leverages fundamental physical layer\ncharacteristics, making it more covert and potentially more threatening\ncompared to previous input-level attacks. Specifically, we utilize channel gain\nwith different fading distributions or channel noise with different power\nspectral densities as potential triggers. This approach establishes\nunprecedented attack flexibility as the adversary can select backdoor triggers\nfrom both fading characteristics and noise variations in diverse channel\nenvironments. Moreover, during the testing phase, CT-BA enables automatic\ntrigger activation through natural channel variations without requiring active\nadversary participation.

Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are observed to undergo powerful\naccretion events known as FU Orionis outbursts (FUors). Such events of episodic\naccretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation,\nwherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding\ncentrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are\ncrucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away\nfrom the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of\nmagnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust\ncontained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the\nthin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a\nrealistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the\nlocal thermal ionization fraction.

This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental\nprocesses such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into\nalready occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of\nlight scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\\rm\nf}$, where $N_{\\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.\nHere, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a\nquasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak\ninteractions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have\na dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)\nbeyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can\ncompletely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive\nones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly\ntuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of\nmagnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics.

However, as\nnondominated solutions of a multi-objective optimisation problem can be\nenormous or infinitely many, it is desirable to provide the decision-maker with\nonly a small, representative portion of all the nondominated solutions in the\narchive, thus entailing a truncation operation. Then, an important issue is\nwhen to truncate the archive. This can be done once a new solution generated, a\nbatch of new solutions generated, or even using an unbounded archive to keep\nall nondominated solutions generated and truncate it later. Intuitively, the\nlast approach may lead to a better result since we have all the information in\nhand before performing the truncation.

To\ntackle this challenge, we develop the topological prior (TP), a new prior\nconstructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent\npairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions\nunder reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure\nand discontinuities of the function. The TP prior, however, only exists in a\ndiscretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior\nmeasure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a TP-Gaussian\nhybrid prior, where the TP component detects sharp discontinuities in the\nfunction, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring\na well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed TP prior\ndemonstrates effects similar to the classical total variation (TV) prior but\noffers greater flexibility and broader applicability due to three key\nadvantages. First, it is defined on a general topological space, making it\neasily adaptable to a wider range of applications. Second, the persistent\ndistance captures richer topological information compared to the discrete TV\nprior. Third, it incorporates more adjustable parameters, providing enhanced\nflexibility to achieve robust numerical results.

Numerous studies advocate for the necessity of fast decoders\nto fully harness the capabilities of QLDPC codes, thus driving the focus\ntowards designing low-complexity iterative decoders. However, empirical\ninvestigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having\na high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper\nis to analyze the decoding failures of the \\emph{hypergraph-product} and\n\\emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these\nfailures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of\nthese codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1)\nstabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers,\nand (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes\nutilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes.\nThe dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a\nstraightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent\nthese trapping sets. Moreover, this work proposes a systematic methodology for\ndesigning decoders that can circumvent classical trapping sets in both\nhypergraph product and lifted product codes, from decoders capable of avoiding\ntheir trapping set in the parent classical LDPC code. When decoders that can\navoid stabilizer-induced trapping sets are run in parallel with those that can\nmitigate the effect of classical TS, the logical error rate improves\nsignificantly in the error-floor region.","main_category":"cs.IT","categories":"cs.IT,math.IT,quant-ph","published":"2025-04-02T13:37:29Z"}

For example, this issue\noften limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to\ntrain multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive\nrollout of a single-step model.

Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars.

Gen-C bypasses the labor-intensive and challenging\ntask of collecting and annotating real crowd video data by leveraging a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate a limited set of crowd scenarios, which are\nsubsequently expanded and generalized through simulations to construct\ntime-expanded graphs that model the actions and interactions of virtual agents.\nOur method employs two Variational Graph Auto-Encoders guided by a condition\nprior network: one dedicated to learning a latent space for graph structures\n(agent interactions) and the other for node features (agent actions and\nnavigation). This setup enables the flexible generation of dynamic crowd\ninteractions. The trained model can be conditioned on natural language,\nempowering users to synthesize novel crowd behaviors from text descriptions. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two scenarios, a University\nCampus and a Train Station, showcasing its potential for populating diverse\nvirtual environments with agents exhibiting varied and dynamic behaviors that\nreflect complex interactions and high-level decision-making patterns.","main_category":"cs.GR","categories":"cs.GR,cs.LG","published":"2025-04-02T17:33:53Z"}

Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical,\nas solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control\nover model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling\noffer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON\nlacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative\nAgent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate\nevaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is\ndesigned and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from\nreward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics\non Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms\nbaselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and\nwithout LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics.

However, optimizing directly such a\nrate-distortion trade-off requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding,\nand feature evaluation for each coding parameter, which is computationally\nimpractical. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make\nthe distortion term computable using block-based encoders.

To address this, we propose the\nperturbative variational quantum eigensolver (PT-VQE). In PT-VQE, VQE is used\nto capture key correlations within a carefully selected active space, while\nperturbation theory efficiently incorporates interactions in the remaining\nspace, without requiring additional qubits or circuit depth. When the\nVQE-optimized state closely approximates the true ground state in the active\nspace, excitations cannot act solely in the active space, since their\ncontributions to perturbative correction are negligible. This reduces the\nhighest-order required RDM from 4-RDM to 3-RDM, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs.

In the present\narticle, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and\nwas already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical\ncontradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost\nentirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may\nsurprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much\nof which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out\nsupposed internal contradictions. Like the first paradox, this one arises from\nthe premise of a universe entirely filled with polyhedra. However, in this\ncase, the contradiction stems from the absence of void outside it. In the first\nsection, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect\nmathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and\nhollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support\nthe necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect\nmathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot\nmove at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction\nin Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier\napparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living\nbeing, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and\nreforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues\nconcerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of\nobservations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between\nintelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of\nPlato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal'\ninterpretation.

The two popular\nframeworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard\nmodel effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory\n(HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new\nphysics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken\nsymmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a\nsinglet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase\neffective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate\nfields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear\nrealization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our\napproach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level,\nwe compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector\nboson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung\nprocess at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT\nreproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the\nregions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the\nelectroweak scale. Therefore, the bEFT serves as a useful framework that can\ncompensate for the shortcomings in both the SMEFT and the HEFT when dealing\nwith UV models that involve Higgs mixing or new particles with a mass close to\nthe electroweak scale.","main_category":"hep-ph","categories":"hep-ph","published":"2025-04-03T13:42:49Z"}

However, current OOD detection methods often suffer from\nrestrictive distributional assumptions, limited scalability, and a lack of\ninterpretability. To address these challenges, we propose STOOD-X, a two-stage\nmethodology that combines a Statistical nonparametric Test for OOD Detection\nwith eXplainability enhancements.

The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting\n(SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. Here, we\nshow that the LC order fundamentally changes the nature of the pairing\ninstability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological\nsuperconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In a single-orbital model on\nthe kagome lattice near van Hove filling, the LC CDW is a Chern metal,\nrealizable in concrete models, with a partially filled Chern band hosting three\nChern Fermi pockets (CFPs). We show that Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on\nthe CFPs is described by three SC components coupled by complex Josephson\ncouplings due to LC.

Existed methods for shifting the\nfrequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect,\nhowever, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz,\nfurthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of\na photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the\nfrequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is\nusually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between\nthese methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter\nbased on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a\nfrequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap.

Traditional\nfederated edge computing (EC) methods require frequent central communication,\nconsuming substantial energy and struggling with resource heterogeneity across\ndevices, networks, and data.

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle\nmultiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential.\nHowever, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather\nconditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world\ndegradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with\ndegradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed\nDA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive\ndegradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration.\nSpecifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware\nrepresentations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space.\nBy aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each\nprompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The\nlearned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed\nweather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple\nweather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather\ndegradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a\ndynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of\nrestoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion\nmodel to restore diverse degradations adaptively.

Planetesimal growth has been investigated\nusing this assumption, and the oligarchic growth model is widely accepted.\nHowever, recent simulations of gas and dust evolution have shown that\nplanetesimals form only in radially limited locations -- such as at gas\npressure bumps and snowlines -- and are concentrated in ring-like regions. When\nplanetesimals are distributed in a ring-like region, scattered ones leak from\nthe ring edge, resulting in planetesimal diffusion. To investigate protoplanet\ngrowth in expanding planetesimal rings, we perform a series of $\\textit{\nN}$-body simulations. In all the simulations, protoplanet growth is well\nexplained by oligarchic growth, while the ring width expands due to\nplanetesimal scattering by the protoplanets. Massive protoplanets tend to form\nnear the ring center, and protoplanets that form far from the ring center are\nless massive than those in the center. The scaled orbital separations depend on\nneither the initial ring width nor on the total mass, and they are consistent\nwith estimates based on the oligarchic growth model and the diffused\nplanetesimal distribution.

Economic Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of\nenergy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while\nensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading\namong hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases\ncomputational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales.\nAdditionally, current distributed control techniques require global\nrecomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework\nthat enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join\nor leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is\nrestricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem\nis formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading\ncommitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and\ncost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both\nlevels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational\nfeasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play\nprocedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster\nlevels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and\nenables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-04-08T16:21:23Z"}

Given a complete graph $G=(V,E)$ and $\\ell$ layers of input\ninformation, where the input of each layer consists of a nonnegative weight and\na labeling of the edges with either + or -, this problem seeks to compute for\neach layer a partition of $V$ such that the partition for any non-top layer\nsubdivides the partition in the upper-layer and the weighted number of\ndisagreements over the layers is minimized.\n  Hierarchical correlation clustering is a natural formulation of the classic\nproblem of fitting distances by ultrametrics, which is further known as\nnumerical taxonomy in the literature. While single-layer correlation clustering\nreceived wide attention since it was introduced and major progress evolved in\nthe past three years, few is known for this problem in the hierarchical\nsetting. The lack of understanding and adequate tools is reflected in the large\napproximation ratio known for this problem originating from 2021.\n  In this work we make both conceptual and technical contributions towards the\nhierarchical clustering problem.

However, it suffers from large\nstorage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the\nhash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it\nespecially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D\nreconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose\nGSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during\ntraining, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such\nGaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training,\nwe improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the\nart.

This paper addresses this\nshortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to\nassess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our\nprotocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to\ncreate rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities\nof the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and\nnearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised\nmodel that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf\nfeatures are used in a linear probing setup.

We have observed this\nissue is exacerbated in high-contented workloads at Tencent, where lock\ncontention can severely degrade system performance. While existing\noptimizations demonstrate some effectiveness in high-contention scenarios,\ntheir performance remains insufficient, as they suffer from lock contention and\nwaiting in hotspot access.\n  This paper presents optimizations in lock management implemented in Tencent's\ndatabase, TXSQL, with a particular focus on high-contention scenarios.

Abbasi et al. presented a unified\napproach to obtain EPASes (i.e., $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximations running in time\nFPT in $k$ and $\\epsilon$) for $k$-Clustering in metrics of bounded scatter\ndimension. However, a seemingly inherent limitation of their approach was that\nit could only handle clustering objectives where each point was assigned to the\nclosest chosen center. They explicitly asked, if there exist EPASes for\nconstrained $k$-Clustering in metrics of bounded scatter dimension.\n  We present a unified framework which yields EPASes capacitated and fair\n$k$-Median/Means in metrics of bounded algorithmic scatter dimension. Our\nframework exploits coresets for such constrained clustering problems in a novel\nmanner, and notably requires only coresets of size $(k\\log n/\\epsilon)^{O(1)}$,\nwhich are usually constuctible even in general metrics.

To achieve this, a promising direction is to conduct\nspeech-text joint modeling. However, recent SLM still lag behind text LLM due\nto the modality mismatch. One significant mismatch can be the sequence lengths\nbetween speech and text tokens.

This forcing is subject to large uncertainties as cloud\nadjustments have not only complex dependence on background conditions, but also\ntemporal fluctuations, especially those driven by diel variations in solar\nheating. However, direct observations of such diel changes are still limited.\nHere, we present observational evidence of substantial diel changes in the\ncloud adjustments to aerosols within ship tracks, linear lines of polluted\nclouds captured in satellite images. We developed a novel method to\nautomatically determine the age of each ship-track segment and analyze cloud\nadjustments to aerosols. We show that more aged polluted clouds with extended\nnighttime exposure exhibit higher increases in cloud fraction. By contrast,\nliquid water path adjustments follow a non-monotonic pattern: they generally\ndecrease with time before reversing trend in clouds formed at nighttime. Most\nof these diel contrasts are statistically significant and likely stem from\ndifferences in solar heating and cloud precipitation. The increase in cloud\nfraction adjustment suggests a larger aerosol effective radiative forcing, -0.1\nto -0.4 W per meter squared, than the estimate without considering temporal\nvariations, while the temporal changes in liquid water path adjustments may\npartially offset it. These findings underscore the importance of diel\nvariations in aerosol cloud interactions.

UniCAIM features simultaneous\nsupport for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM\nmode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for\ndynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain\nCIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity\nscore, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the\ncurrent-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset\nof selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that\nleverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage\nof the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental\nresults, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP)\nby 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit\nlevel, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the\napplication level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM\ninference.","main_category":"cs.AR","categories":"cs.AR","published":"2025-04-10T06:13:30Z"}
{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07483v1","title":"Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation","summary":"Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for\nwhich automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger\nprograms. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program\ntest suites.","main_category":"cs.PL","categories":"cs.PL,cs.SE","published":"2025-04-10T06:25:17Z"}

Properly\nidentifying these subspaces is critical for unsupervised tasks such as outlier\ndetection or clustering, where misrepresenting the underlying data structure\ncan hinder the performance.

In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a\nretrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve\nsupportive codes for real-world code generation. Beginning with the\nrequirement, CodeRAG first constructs a requirement graph for the current\nrepository, and retrieves sub- and similar- requirement nodes of the target\nrequirement on the graph. Meanwhile, it models the repository into a DS-code\ngraph.

Classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), low-mass PMS stars\nactively accreting from a disc, hold a well-described magnetospheric accretion\nmodel. Their strong, inclined dipole magnetic fields truncate the disc at a few\nstellar radii, channelling material along magnetic field lines to fall onto the\nstellar surface near the dipole pole. However, this paradigm assumes the\npresence of a single star, and a complete description of the accretion process\nin multiple systems remains to be achieved. Building on our previous work on DQ\nTau and AK Sco, we aim to describe the accretion processes in cTTS binaries,\naccounting for the influence of stellar magnetic fields. Specifically, we\nsought to explore how the magnetospheric accretion model of cTTSs can be\napplied to V4046 Sgr, a spectroscopic binary composed of equal-mass and coeval\ncTTSs in a circular orbit with synchronous rotation, surrounded by a\ncircumbinary disc. We analysed a time series of ESPaDOnS spectra covering\nseveral orbital cycles. A variability analysis was performed on the radial\nvelocities and on the Balmer, He I D3, and Ca II emission lines, which are\nassociated with the accretion process. We identified the secondary as the\nsystem's main accretor, operating in an unstable regime. Additionally, we\ndetected an accretion funnel flow connecting the dipole pole of the primary\nstar with a nearby bulk of gas. We concluded that the two components exhibit\ndissimilar accretion patterns. The primary operates in an \"ordered chaotic\"\nregime, where accretion funnel flows and accretion tongues coexist. Conversely,\nthe secondary appears to be in a chaotic regime, with accretion tongues\ndominating.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-04-14T13:33:44Z"}

Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE\nsystem via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the\ntask of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function\n$f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which\nrequires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and\nnecessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that\nencodes $f(x)$. This construction can be highly complex, even for simple\nfunctions like $f(x) = x$. An important exception arises for the specific case\nof $f(x) = sin^2(mx+c)$, which can be encoded more efficiently using a set of\n$Ry$ rotation gates. To address these challenges, we expand the driving\nfunction $f(x)$ as a Fourier series and propose the Quantum Fourier ODE Solver.\nThis approach not only simplifies the construction of the oracle R but also\nremoves the restriction that $f(x)$ must lie within [0,1]. The proposed method\nwas evaluated by solving several representative linear and nonlinear PDEs,\nincluding the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations.

Prior works formulate the\ntraffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire\nsequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full\nsequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted\nnext-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned\nmodel struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large\nnumber of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome\nthese, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves\nreactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging\nscenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core\nof the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking\ntraining strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental\nupdates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario\ngeneration, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers\n540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in,\nsudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while\npreserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in\ndisplacement error.

A penalty-based successive convex approximation method\nis developed for iteratively optimizing the finite-size weighting vectors. To\nfurther reduce the computational complexity, we propose a two-stage source\ncurrent patterns design scheme. Specifically, the information-bearing and AN\npatterns are first designed using the maximal ration transmission and\nzero-forcing transmission, respectively. Then, the remaining power allocation\nis addressed via the one-dimensional search method. Numerical results unveil\nthat 1) the CAPA brings in significant secrecy rate gain compared to the\nconventional discrete multiple-input multiple-output; 2) the proposed channel\nsubspace-based algorithm outperforms the conventional Fourier-based approach,\nwhile sustaining much lower computational complexity; and 3) the two-stage\nZF-MRT approach has negligible performance loss for the large transmit power\nregime.","main_category":"eess.SP","categories":"eess.SP","published":"2025-04-15T12:02:03Z"}

To address this, we propose a diffusion model\n(DM)-based approach for SAR-to-RGB translation, generating synthetic optical\nimages from SAR inputs. We explore three different setups: two using Standard\nDiffusion, which reconstruct S2 images by adding and removing noise (one\nwithout and one with class conditioning), and one using Cold Diffusion, which\nblends S2 with S1 before removing the SAR signal. We evaluate the generated\nimages in downstream tasks, including land cover classification and cloud\nremoval. While generated images may not perfectly replicate real S2 data, they\nstill provide valuable information.

On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-4o,\nGemini-1.Pro, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions\nmore than 30% of the time. Even advanced medical agentic methods do not prevent\nLLMs from ignoring false presuppositions.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11375v1","title":"Ring Artifacts Correction Based on Global-Local Features Interaction\n  Guidance in the Projection Domain","summary":"Ring artifacts are common artifacts in CT imaging, typically caused by\ninconsistent responses of detector units to X-rays, resulting in stripe\nartifacts in the projection data. Under circular scanning mode, such artifacts\nmanifest as concentric rings radiating from the center of rotation, severely\ndegrading image quality. In the Radon transform domain, even if the object's\ndensity function is piecewise discontinuous in certain regions, the projection\nimages remain nearly continuous in the angular direction, making the ideal\nprojections exhibit a smooth global low-frequency characteristic. In practical\nscanning, the local disturbances of the same detector unit at different\nscanning angles lead to a prominent high-frequency locality of stripe\nartifacts. Existing studies generally model ring artifacts disturbances as\nfixed additive errors, which overlooks the dynamic variation of detector\nresponses during practical scanning. However, the degree of detector response\ninconsistency is a function of the projection values, as revealed in our\nexperiments, thereby requiring consideration of the interaction between global\nand local features in the process of stripe artifacts extraction and\ncorrection. Therefore, we propose a CT ring artifacts correction method based\non global and local features in the projection domain. We employ the VSS block\nand Dense block to respectively correct the low-frequency sub-band, which\ncapture the global correlations of the projection, and the high-frequency\nsub-band, which contain local stripe artifacts after wavelet decomposition.\nSpecifically, the accuracy of artifacts correction is enhanced by the\ninteraction guidance between global and local features. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both quantitative\nmetrics and visual quality, verifying its robustness and practical\napplicability.","main_category":"eess.IV","categories":"eess.IV,I.4.5","published":"2025-04-15T16:42:23Z"}

Traditional CCA methods, based on sample covariance matrices,\nstruggle in high-dimensional settings, particularly when data exhibit\nheavy-tailed distributions. To address this, we introduce the spatial-sign\ncovariance matrix as a robust estimator, combined with a sparsity-inducing\npenalty to efficiently estimate canonical correlations. Theoretical analysis\nshows that our method is consistent and robust under mild conditions,\nconverging at an optimal rate even in the presence of heavy tails. Simulation\nstudies demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing sparse CCA methods,\nparticularly under heavy-tailed distributions. A real-world application further\nconfirms the method's robustness and efficiency in practice. Our work provides\na novel solution for high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis, offering\nsignificant advantages over traditional methods in terms of both stability and\nperformance.","main_category":"stat.ME","categories":"stat.ME","published":"2025-04-17T15:25:51Z"}

Estimating galaxy physical properties using CatBoost\n  chained regressors with attention","summary":"Euclid will image ~14000 deg^2 of the extragalactic sky at visible and NIR\nwavelengths, providing a dataset of unprecedented size and richness that will\nfacilitate a multitude of studies into the evolution of galaxies. In the vast\nmajority of cases the main source of information will come from broad-band\nimages and data products thereof. Therefore, there is a pressing need to\nidentify or develop scalable yet reliable methodologies to estimate the\nredshift and physical properties of galaxies using broad-band photometry from\nEuclid, optionally including ground-based optical photometry also. To address\nthis need, we present a novel method to estimate the redshift, stellar mass,\nstar-formation rate, specific star-formation rate, E(B-V), and age of galaxies,\nusing mock Euclid and ground-based photometry. The main novelty of our\nproperty-estimation pipeline is its use of the CatBoost implementation of\ngradient-boosted regression-trees, together with chained regression and an\nintelligent, automatic optimization of the training data. The pipeline also\nincludes a computationally-efficient method to estimate prediction\nuncertainties, and, in the absence of ground-truth labels, provides accurate\npredictions for metrics of model performance up to z~2. We apply our pipeline\nto several datasets consisting of mock Euclid broad-band photometry and mock\nground-based ugriz photometry, to evaluate the performance of our methodology\nfor estimating the redshift and physical properties of galaxies detected in the\nEuclid Wide Survey. The quality of our photometric redshift and physical\nproperty estimates are highly competitive overall, validating our modeling\napproach. We find that the inclusion of ground-based optical photometry\nsignificantly improves the quality of the property estimation, highlighting the\nimportance of combining Euclid data with ancillary ground-based optical data.\n(Abridged)","main_category":"astro-ph.GA","categories":"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM","published":"2025-04-17T15:28:36Z"}

Additional\nchallenges arise due to the fact that smart glasses are worn in arbitrary\nenvironments while their wearer moves and performs everyday activities.

As such, amateur\nusers can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's\nwork and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright\ninfringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually\nimperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles\n(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in\nthe artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model\nhas been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model\nretraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.\n  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the\ntext-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to\nidentify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of\nspecific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,\nArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style\nrepresentations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,\nArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.\nThe experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that\nArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying\nArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights\ninto the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario.

Although single-pattern structured\nlight enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging\nto recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the\nentanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design\na spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and\nuniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the\nsame time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear\npolarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region,\nwhich separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We\nachieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn\nsequence.
