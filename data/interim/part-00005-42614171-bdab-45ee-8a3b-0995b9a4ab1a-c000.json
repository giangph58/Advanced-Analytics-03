Here, we propose using\ncircularly polarized light to tune the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. Using the real-space\nretarded Green's functions approach, our results show that while the Heisenberg\nand Ising exchanges dominate, a notable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nalso plays a key role. Furthermore, the inherent strength of altermagnetism\nimprints chirp-like signatures into the magnetic responses, which can be\ndynamically tuned via light. We mainly demonstrate that gate-induced Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is essential in response to light -- light selectively and\nanisotropically adjusts the DM interaction without affecting the other\nexchanges. Our findings further indicate that rotating the altermagnet by\n$45^\\circ$ relative to the light's polarization direction generates a\nDirac-like dispersion and different DM interactions. We finally extract\ncritical thresholds where light reverses DM interactions along one axis or\nbalances both in-plane components.

Accurate identification and measurement of key\ncharacteristics of wheat heads are essential for breeders to select varieties\nfor cross-breeding, with the goal of developing nutrient-dense, resilient, and\nsustainable cultivars. Traditionally, these measurements are performed\nmanually, which is both time-consuming and inefficient. Advances in digital\ntechnologies have paved the way for automating this process. However, field\nconditions pose significant challenges, such as occlusions of leaves,\noverlapping wheat heads, varying lighting conditions, and motion blur. In this\npaper, we propose a novel data augmentation technique, BBoxCut, which uses\nrandom localized masking to simulate occlusions caused by leaves and\nneighboring wheat heads. We evaluated our approach using three state-of-the-art\nobject detectors and observed mean average precision (mAP) gains of 2.76, 3.26,\nand 1.9 for Faster R-CNN, FCOS, and DETR, respectively. Our augmentation\ntechnique led to significant improvements both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.

WSOL only requires low-cost image-class\nannotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier, which is\nimportant in histology image analysis. Standard WSOL methods rely on class\nactivation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according\nto a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant\nprogress, they still face several limitations with histology images.\nSingle-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the\nlimited visual ROI saliency in histology images and the limited localization\ncues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between\nclassification and localization tasks.

We show that the\nimplicit electric field conjugation algorithm can be used to reduce the stellar\ncoupling through the PLN by orders of magnitude while maintaining the majority\nof the off-axis light, leading to deeper null depths (~10^{-4}) and thus higher\nsensitivity to potential planet signals. We discuss a theory for the tradeoff\nwe observed between the different ports, where iEFC improves the nulls of some\nports at the expense of others, and show that targeting one port alone can lead\nto deeper starlight rejection through that port than when targeting all ports\nat once. We also observe different levels of stability depending on the port\nand discuss the implications for practically implementing this technique for\nscience observations.","main_category":"astro-ph.IM","categories":"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.EP","published":"2025-03-31T16:38:18Z"}

Among the interesting\nphenomena is the commonly observed dual-band emission, which has often been\ninterpreted by adopting the phenomenological model that explains the dual-band\nemission (``ultraviolet band'' and ``visible band'') in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$\n($L$ = Sc, Y, Lu). However, the model for Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series itself\nhas not been well understood theoretically. In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify\nthe underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped\n$L$PO$_{4}$ series. We demonstrate that the dual-band arises from two\nexcited-state equilibrium structures, one exhibits a relatively small\ndistortion with respect to the ground-state equilibrium structure, while the\nother displays a significantly larger distortion, characteristic of an\n``off-center'' configuration. The deviations from the ground-state\nconfiguration are dominated by two distinct vibrational modes, $b_2$ and $e$\nmodes, involving the Jahn-Teller effect and the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect,\nrespectively. Furthermore, charge transition levels and energy barriers\ncalculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method have\naided in understanding the relaxation between the two excited-state\nconfigurations and the property changes across the Sc, Y, and Lu series.

However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural\nnetworks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in\nerroneous or malicious outputs. While existing efforts utilize adversarial\nfine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance\ndegradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel\nadversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For\nthe first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization\nproblem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs\non clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for\nadversarial examples.

While conventional\ncaptioning models exhibit high performance on established metrics such as BLEU,\nCIDEr, and SPICE, the capability of captions to distinguish the target image\nfrom other similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions,\na few pioneers employed contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth\ncaptions. However, these approaches often overlook the relationships among\nobjects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same\nalbum or fine-grained events). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to\nenhance the distinctiveness of image captions, namely Group-based Differential\nDistinctive Captioning Method, which visually compares each image with other\nimages in one similar group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In\nparticular, we introduce a Group-based Differential Memory Attention (GDMA)\nmodule, designed to identify and emphasize object features in an image that are\nuniquely distinguishable within its image group, i.e., those exhibiting low\nsimilarity with objects in other images. This mechanism ensures that such\nunique object features are prioritized during caption generation for the image,\nthereby enhancing the distinctiveness of the resulting captions. To further\nrefine this process, we select distinctive words from the ground-truth captions\nto guide both the language decoder and the GDMA module. Additionally, we\npropose a new evaluation metric, the Distinctive Word Rate (DisWordRate), to\nquantitatively assess caption distinctiveness. Quantitative results indicate\nthat the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of several\nbaseline models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinctiveness\nwhile not excessively sacrificing accuracy...","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.MM","published":"2025-04-03T11:19:51Z"}

Each normal metal has two\nterminals, and when a bias is applied at one terminal while keeping the other\nthree grounded, valley polarization arises due to transverse momentum matching\nbetween graphene and the normal metal. The valley polarization is maximized\nwhen the Fermi wave vector of the normal metal is approximately half the\nseparation between the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in graphene. We analyze the\ndependence of conductance and valley polarization on system parameters such as\nthe width and length of the graphene sheet, as well as the chemical potentials\nof graphene and the normal metal. The conductance through graphene increases\nwith its width, while an increase in length initially reduces the conductance\nbefore leading to oscillatory behavior due to Fabry-P\\'erot interference.

In a previous\nwork, we modelled this evolving escape, alongside one of its observable\ntracers, the helium triplet transit signature at 1083nm. Using hydrodynamic and\nray-tracing models, we demonstrated that atmospheric escape and the\ncorresponding He 1083nm signature are stronger at younger ages, for a\n0.3$~M_\\text{J}$ gas-giant.

However, its real-world application often fails due to a\nlack of user acceptance and trust. A possible remedy is to provide managers\nwith the possibility of altering the RL policy by incorporating human expert\nknowledge. In this study, we analyze the benefits and caveats of including\nhuman knowledge via action masking. While action masking has so far been used\nto exclude invalid actions, its ability to integrate human expertise remains\nunderexplored. Human knowledge is often encapsulated in heuristics, which\nsuggest reasonable, near-optimal actions in certain situations. Enforcing such\nactions should hence increase trust among the human workforce to rely on the\nmodel's decisions. Yet, a strict enforcement of heuristic actions may also\nrestrict the policy from exploring superior actions, thereby leading to overall\nlower performance. We analyze the effects of action masking based on three\nproblems with different characteristics, namely, paint shop scheduling, peak\nload management, and inventory management. Our findings demonstrate that\nincorporating human knowledge through action masking can achieve substantial\nimprovements over policies trained without action masking. In addition, we find\nthat action masking is crucial for learning effective policies in constrained\naction spaces, where certain actions can only be performed a limited number of\ntimes. Finally, we highlight the potential for suboptimal outcomes when action\nmasks are overly restrictive.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,math.OC","published":"2025-04-03T15:00:04Z"}

This phenomenon plays a crucial role in a\nvariety of plasma technologies, including Hall thrusters, where azimuthal\ninstabilities significantly influence electron confinement and, hence, device\nperformance. While the impact of prominent plasma instabilities, such as the\nelectron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream\ninstability (MTSI) on cross-field transport of electron species is well\nrecognized and widely studied, strategies for actively manipulating these\ndynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the effect of\ntargeted wave excitation on instability evolution and electron transport using\none- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of representative plasma\ndischarge configurations. A time-varying electric field is applied axially to\nmodulate the spectral energy distribution of the instabilities across a range\nof forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Our results reveal that the so-called\n\"unsteady forcing\" can both suppress and amplify instability modes depending on\nexcitation parameters.

Our findings highlight a complex interplay between\nelectrical parameters of the bare thin films and stability of the devices\n(p-i-n diodes) after thermal stress. FA-CsSnI3 showed beneficial results for\nstabilization under elevated temperatures with improved non-ideality factor in\ndiode structures, enhanced shunt properties and reduced trapping. The\nphoto-induced voltage relaxation spectroscopy performed for MA-CsSnI3 showed\nrelevant traps concentration of 1016 cm-3 with activation energy of 0.52\neV(210K) likely attributed to Sn atom defect. The obtained results are deeply\nanalyzed and discussed.","main_category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph","published":"2025-04-07T08:02:17Z"}

Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on\nthe measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental\ncharacteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an\nAttentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial\nadjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring\nfingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar\nenvironmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor\nrequired for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation\nstrategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which\nenables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from\nunlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation\nthrough environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework\nthrough a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature\ndiscrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively.

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between\nthe two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced\nin a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the\ndrive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more\nrobust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do\nnot significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains\nrobust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is\nsufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the\nbit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By\nconsidering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system\ndo not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to\nthe system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough\nexcitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise.

However, current benchmarks do not fully\naddress these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural\nimages, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we\nintroduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for\nbenchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs\nin document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human\ninteraction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as\na benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four\ndiverse datasets.

This paper introduces SmartBugBert, a novel approach that\ncombines BERT-based deep learning with control flow graph (CFG) analysis to\ndetect vulnerabilities directly from bytecode. Our method first decompiles\nsmart contract bytecode into optimized opcode sequences, extracts semantic\nfeatures using TF-IDF, constructs control flow graphs to capture execution\nlogic, and isolates vulnerable CFG fragments for targeted analysis. By\nintegrating both semantic and structural information through a fine-tuned BERT\nmodel and LightGBM classifier, our approach effectively identifies four\ncritical vulnerability types: transaction-ordering, access control,\nself-destruct, and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. Experimental\nevaluation on 6,157 Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that SmartBugBert\nachieves 90.62% precision, 91.76% recall, and 91.19% F1-score, significantly\noutperforming existing detection methods.

Since self-attention\nmechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to\nkey objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture,\nscale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain\nadaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with\ndynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in\ntransferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask\nTransformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic\nsegmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial\ntransferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive\nCluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images\ninto structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized\ntransferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA)\nmodule that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs'\nattention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low\ntransferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across\n20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2%\nMIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-08T07:53:51Z"}

In many CCPs, one optimizes an objective under\na probabilistic constraint continuously parameterized by a random vector $\\xi$.\nIn this work, we study the specific case where the constraint is quasi-convex\nwith $\\xi$. Moreover, the support of vector $\\xi$ is a collection of $N$\nscenarios in dimension $p=2$ or $p=3$. In general, even when both the\nconstraint and the objective are convex in the decision variable, the feasible\nregion of a CCP is nonconvex, turning it into a difficult problem. However,\nunder mild assumptions, many CCPs can be recast as big-$M$ mixed-integer convex\nprograms (MICP). Unfortunately, the difficulty of these MICPs explodes with the\nnumber of scenarios, restricting the instances practically solvable in decent\ntime. To cut down the effective number of scenarios considered in MICP\nreformulations and accelerate their solving, we propose and test presolve\ntechniques based on computational geometry. Our techniques produce certificates\nto discard or select a priori some scenarios before solving a regular MICP.\nMoreover, the information aggregated during presolve leverages the possibility\nto strengthen big-$M$ constants.

However, distinguishing\nviral sequences from the vast background of cellular organism-derived reads in\nmetagenomic data remains a significant challenge. While several learning-based\ntools, such as VirSorter2 and geNomad, have shown promise in identifying viral\ncontigs, they often experience varying degrees of false positive rates due to\nnoise in sequencing and assembly, shared genes between viruses and their hosts,\nand the formation of proviruses within host genomes.

Among various guidance strategies presented in literature,\nlook-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant\nattention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low\ncross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded\nlateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes\nproblematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce\nhigher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high\nvariation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of\nlook-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance\nstrategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized\n$L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference\npath in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the\nvehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of\ncorrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to\ngenerate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root\nmean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance\nstrategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the\nconventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and\nmeasures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration\nrequirements.","main_category":"cs.RO","categories":"cs.RO,cs.SY,eess.SY","published":"2025-04-08T12:31:19Z"}

This is based on extending the information bottleneck principle,\noriginally developed for communication and machine learning applications, to\ndecision problems via the Chernoff information, with the ultimate goal of\nquantitatively optimizing the trade-off between covertness and sensing ability.\nIn this context we show how quantum resources, namely entangled photonic probes\npaired with photon counting, greatly outperform classical coherent transmitters\nin target detection and ranging, while also maintaining a chosen level of\ncovertness. Our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum\nsensing in LiDAR systems to enhance the covert performance.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph,physics.optics","published":"2025-04-08T17:05:41Z"}

Going beyond final accuracy,\nwe propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output\nfrom language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks:\nunderstanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow\nfrom them. The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with\nthe goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs\nunderstand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can\nthey infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? Since existing benchmarks\nmay be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency\non novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems.

In general, PA jumps can arise from the superposition of two\nelectromagnetic waves, either coherently or incoherently, as the dominance of\nthe two orthogonal modes switches. In the coherent case, PA jumps occur when\nlinear polarization reaches a minimum and circular polarization peaks, with the\ntotal polarization degree conserved.

Many previous SPH porous\nflow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid\ninterface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid\nand solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows\nus to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account\nand results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can\nsimulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid\nand solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit\nforces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces. These\nwe solve as a linear system and strongly couple with fluid viscosity and solid\nelasticity. We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely\ndrag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic\nbehavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening,\nwe propose an extension to the elasticity model. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nour model with various simulations that showcase the different aspects of\nporous flow behavior. To summarize, our system of strongly coupled non-pressure\nforces and enforced incompressibility across overlapping phases allows us to\nnaturally model and stably simulate complex porous interactions.","main_category":"cs.GR","categories":"cs.GR,physics.flu-dyn","published":"2025-04-10T13:30:22Z"}

To mitigate such biases, prior studies have\nattempted to project model embeddings into unbiased spaces during inference.\nHowever, these approaches have shown limited effectiveness due to their weak\nalignment with downstream social biases. Inspired by the observation that\nconcept cognition in LLMs is primarily represented through a linear associative\nmemory mechanism, where key-value mapping occurs in the MLP layers, we posited\nthat biased concepts and social groups are similarly encoded as entity (key)\nand information (value) pairs, which can be manipulated to promote fairer\nassociations. To this end, we propose Fairness Mediator (FairMed), a bias\nmitigation framework that neutralizes stereotype associations. Our framework\ncomprises two main components: a stereotype association prober and an\nadversarial debiasing neutralizer. The prober captures stereotype associations\nencoded within MLP layer activations by employing prompts centered around\nbiased concepts to detect the emission probabilities for social groups.\nSubsequently, the adversarial debiasing neutralizer intervenes in MLP\nactivations during inference to equalize the association probabilities among\ndifferent social groups. Extensive experiments across nine protected attributes\nshow that FairMed significantly outperforms SOTA methods in effectiveness.\nCompared to the most effective baseline, FairMed presents competitive\nefficiency by cutting mitigation overhead by hundreds of minutes.

The influence of an exomoon on the polarization phase curve of an\nexoplanet-exomoon system is dependent on the lunar polarization phase curve.\nObservations of full eclipses and occultations of the exomoon allow the\ndetermination of separate polarization phase curves for the two bodies.\nInformation about the lunar orbital inclination can be obtained with\npolarimetric observations of shadows or transits. Measuring the influence of\nlarge satellites not only on the total flux, but also on the polarization of\nthe reflected stellar radiation during mutual events thus facilitates the\nprediction of future mutual events and the verification of exomoon candidates.","main_category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":"astro-ph.EP","published":"2025-04-14T11:34:10Z"}

One major source of our questions is manually translated\nlogical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination.\nExperiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive\ndomain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks\nlike MMMU, enabling us to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning.\nEvaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\nconsistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong\nperformance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to\nsuccess on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks.

The diffusion behavior of lithium ions in\nthe contained polycrystalline solid-state electrolyte is crucial for battery\nfunction. While atomistic studies indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) and\ngrain size significantly impact diffusivity, the corresponding effects are\neither neglected in simulations on larger scales or considered only under\nstrong assumptions such as isotropy. Our approach considers the fully resolved\ncrystalline structure with a parametrization aligned with the atomistic\nperspective to describe diffusion along and across GBs. The approach is\nembedded into a finite element simulation using a novel collapsed interface\nelement based on an analytical description in thickness direction. Results are\ngoverned by different and potentially anisotropic diffusion coefficients in\nbulk and GB domains. The mesoscale response is derived using linear\ncomputational homogenization to capture large-scale effects. The novel\ncollapsed interface description allows for a reconstruction of the 3D transport\nbehavior within the GB domain without resolving it and is able to capture the\nrelevant transport mechanisms such as channeling effects and concentration\njumps. Grain size and GB volume fraction are expressed in terms of an affine\nparameter dependence and can be altered without any changes to geometry or\nmesh.

Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social\ninfluences from observed social networks.

The removal of these redundant social relations is\ncrucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth.

However, these methods usually adopt the\nstandard full fine-tuning paradigm, which requires the optimization of\nconsiderable backbone parameters, causing extensive computational and storage\nrequirements. In this work, we propose an efficient prompt-tuning framework\ntailored for multi-modal object re-identification, dubbed DMPT, which freezes\nthe main backbone and only optimizes several newly added decoupled\nmodality-aware parameters. Specifically, we explicitly decouple the visual\nprompts into modality-specific prompts which leverage prior modality knowledge\nfrom a powerful text encoder and modality-independent semantic prompts which\nextract semantic information from multi-modal inputs, such as visible,\nnear-infrared, and thermal-infrared. Built upon the extracted features, we\nfurther design a Prompt Inverse Bind (PromptIBind) strategy that employs bind\nprompts as a medium to connect the semantic prompt tokens of different\nmodalities and facilitates the exchange of complementary multi-modal\ninformation, boosting final re-identification results.

The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and\ntextual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR\nexhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to\ndisproportionately emphasize either the reference image features\n(visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant\nfusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation\noften fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the\nuser in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a\nnovel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key\ninnovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP\nencoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images,\nsynthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion\nmodel. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced\nintents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune\nall encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the\ntarget image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual\nrepresentations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the\ncomposed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR\ndatasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-15T09:14:04Z"}

However, rather being limited to a standard sensitivity\nanalysis, the explanation provided by our method relies on the solution of an\ninverse Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem, offering a structured and more\ncontrol-relevant perspective. Numerical examples demonstrate that the inferred\ncost function consistently provides a deeper understanding of the controller's\ndecision-making process, shedding light on otherwise counterintuitive or\nunexpected phenomena.","main_category":"eess.SY","categories":"eess.SY,cs.SY","published":"2025-04-15T17:56:24Z"}

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11973v1","title":"Probing the cold nature of dark matter","summary":"A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological\nobservations. However, there are indications that cold dark matter may\nencounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly\nat galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models\nincorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale\nproblems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark\nmatter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning\ninto the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly\nincreases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold\ndark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\\rm de}$),\nand dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of\nstate ($w_{\\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark\nenergy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze\ninteracting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these\nscenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their\ncombination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our\nanalyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot\nbe excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets,\nthere is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more\nthan 95\\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of\nstate lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This\nstudy suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter\ncomponent should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological\nimplications, as reflected in the present work.","main_category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc","published":"2025-04-16T11:10:56Z"}

To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we\nintroduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and\naccuracy by projecting VQE optimizations on to a reduced-dimensional subspace,\nfollowed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz\ninto a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary\nsubspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the\nparameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this\nhierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace\nonly. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space\nreconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These\nreconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the\ncost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC) leading to a\n\"plummeting effect\" in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minima\nwithout utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical\nsimulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our\nmethod can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the\nminima. Additionally, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a\nnovel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for\naccelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms. Our\nmethod shows heuristic evidences of alleviating the effects of local traps,\nfacilitating convergence toward a more optimal minimum.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-04-17T17:07:09Z"}

By\nstatistically comparing observations with modeled spectra, we derive physical\nparameters to constrain these mechanisms. Results: Our analysis reveals a\npopulation of 49 extremely low dust attenuation galaxies (GELDAs), consistent\nwith $A_{FUV} = 0.0$ within $2\\sigma$ and $M_{\\star} < 10^9 M_\\odot$. The\nstacked spectrum of GELDAs shows a very blue UV slope $\\beta_{FUV} = -2.451 \\pm\n0.066$ and a Balmer decrement H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta = 2.932 \\pm 0.660$, consistent\nwith no dust and Case B recombination with minimal underlying absorption.\nNotably, GELDAs are more prevalent at $z > 8.8$ (83.3\\%) than at lower\nredshifts (26.3\\%), suggesting they could dominate in the early Universe.\n  Using a far-infrared dust spectrum from the ALPINE sample, we study\n$M_{dust}$ vs. $M_{\\star}$ trends.

Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,\nwe investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept\nblending.

To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a\nhigh-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according\nto the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in\ncomprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while\nfalling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating\nour IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the\ncreative quality of VLMs outputs.
