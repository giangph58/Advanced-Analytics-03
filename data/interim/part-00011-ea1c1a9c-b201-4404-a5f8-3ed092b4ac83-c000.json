The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their\npositions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could\nsignificantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this\npotential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional,\ncomplex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within\na rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and\ncrescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its\nplacement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant\nfrequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of\ninternal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node\ngeneration. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect\nratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the\nchannel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor,\nwhich is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic\nenergy per cycle.

Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are observed to undergo powerful\naccretion events known as FU Orionis outbursts (FUors). Such events of episodic\naccretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation,\nwherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding\ncentrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are\ncrucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away\nfrom the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of\nmagnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust\ncontained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the\nthin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a\nrealistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the\nlocal thermal ionization fraction.

The simulated disk\ndisplays outbursting behavior in the early stages, with the duration and\nfrequency of the bursts, their rise times, and brightness amplitudes resembling\nthe observations of FUors. We find that during the outbursts, the winds are\nover an order of magnitude more dusty, as compared to in quiescence.

Given the stacked structure of neural\nnetworks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below,\nthis approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features\nlive on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are\nexpected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning\nmethod named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards\npropagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching\nmethods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We\nbelieve this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of\ngradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical\nrepresentations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the\nrepresentation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target,\nlearning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\nimage classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable\nlearning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and\ncomputationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free\nmethods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm,\nNoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more\nefficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other\ncharacteristics of the learning process.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-03-31T17:08:57Z"}

To\ntackle this challenge, we develop the topological prior (TP), a new prior\nconstructed using persistent homology. The proposed prior utilizes persistent\npairs to characterize and record the topological variations of the functions\nunder reconstruction, thereby encoding prior information about the structure\nand discontinuities of the function. The TP prior, however, only exists in a\ndiscretized formulation, which leads to the absence of a well-defined posterior\nmeasure in function spaces. To resolve this issue, we propose a TP-Gaussian\nhybrid prior, where the TP component detects sharp discontinuities in the\nfunction, while the Gaussian distribution acts as a reference measure, ensuring\na well-defined posterior measure in the function space. The proposed TP prior\ndemonstrates effects similar to the classical total variation (TV) prior but\noffers greater flexibility and broader applicability due to three key\nadvantages. First, it is defined on a general topological space, making it\neasily adaptable to a wider range of applications. Second, the persistent\ndistance captures richer topological information compared to the discrete TV\nprior.

Our approach involves a comprehensive\nanalysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and\nutterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of\nstate-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature\nextraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion\ntechniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM)\npredictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron\nclassifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity\nprediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification\n(considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that\nutterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for\ntext and audio modalities.

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02374v1","title":"On an Unnoticed Geometrical Paradox in Plato's Timaeus' Cosmology","summary":"In a previous article, we discussed a paradox in Timaeus' cosmology: that\nthere is no void inside the universe, even though it is entirely filled with\npolyhedra-a mathematical impossibility (Brisson-Ofman 2025). In the present\narticle, we examine another paradox. While the first paradox is well known and\nwas already highlighted by Aristotle as a fundamental mathematical\ncontradiction undermining Plato's cosmology, this new paradox has gone almost\nentirely unnoticed by commentators, both ancient and modern. This oversight may\nsurprise scholars, given the extensive body of work on Timaeus' universe, much\nof which emphasizes discrepancies with astronomical observations or points out\nsupposed internal contradictions. Like the first paradox, this one arises from\nthe premise of a universe entirely filled with polyhedra. However, in this\ncase, the contradiction stems from the absence of void outside it. In the first\nsection, we demonstrate that the shape of the universe cannot be a perfect\nmathematical sphere: that is, its boundary is not smooth but exhibits bumps and\nhollows. Next, we present conceptual arguments from Plato's text that support\nthe necessity of such 'defects' in the universe's shape compared to a perfect\nmathematical sphere. In the third section, we argue that such a universe cannot\nmove at all. Finally, we propose a solution to this mathematical contradiction\nin Timaeus' construction, drawing on the same ideas used to address the earlier\napparent contradiction: the unique feature of Timaeus' universe as a living\nbeing, whose parts are continuously moving, changing, decomposing, and\nreforming. While this problem does not depend on the various schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, it is related to some important issues\nconcerning Plato's philosophy. These issues include the importance of\nobservations in science-particularly in astronomy-the relationship between\nintelligible models and their sensible copies, the mythos/ logos approach of\nPlato's cosmology, and the debate over 'metaphorical' vs 'literal'\ninterpretation. Of course, all these questions fall outside the scope of this\narticle and will not be addressed here.","main_category":"math.HO","categories":"math.HO","published":"2025-04-03T08:08:21Z"}

This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and\n$f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of\nassessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard\ngravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the\ngrowth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias.

In this\npaper, we propose adaptive resource allocation strategies for OFDM-ISAC systems\nto achieve optimal trade-offs between diverse sensing requirements and\ncommunication quality-of-service (QoS). We first develop a comprehensive\nresource allocation framework for OFDM-ISAC systems, deriving closed-form\nexpressions for key sensing performance metrics, including delay resolution,\nDoppler resolution, delay-Doppler peak sidelobe level (PSL), and received\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The resolution-oriented algorithm aims to maximize the weighted\ndelay-Doppler resolution while satisfying constraints on PSL, sensing SNR,\ncommunication sum-rate, and transmit power. The sidelobe-oriented algorithm\nfocuses on minimizing delay-Doppler PSL while satisfying resolution, SNR, and\ncommunication constraints. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex\noptimization problems, we develop two adaptive resource allocation algorithms\nbased on Dinkelbach's transform and majorization-minimization (MM).

{"aid":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07031v1","title":"Identifying Key Challenges of Hardness-Based Resampling","summary":"Performance gap across classes remains a persistent challenge in machine\nlearning, often attributed to variations in class hardness. One way to quantify\nclass hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples\nrequired to effectively learn a given class. Sample complexity theory suggests\nthat class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for\ngeneralization. That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to\nachieve generalization. Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising\napproach to mitigate these performance disparities. While resampling has been\nstudied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced\ndatasets remains unexplored.\n  This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because\nit addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance. We begin addressing this\nquestion by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its\neffect on performance disparities. We oversample hard classes and undersample\neasy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity\nrequirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness. We\nestimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness\nestimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios. Using these ratios, we\nperform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets.\n  Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based\nresampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities. To\nexplain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key\nchallenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from\ntraditional data-based imbalance. Our insights help explain why theoretical\nsample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance\ngains and we provide guidelines for future research.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-09T16:45:57Z"}

AV-GAE identifies and exploits structural relationships between\nbenign models and their training data features. By manipulating these\nstructural correlations, the attack maximizes the training loss of the\nfederated learning system, compromising its overall effectiveness.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG","published":"2025-04-14T10:09:38Z"}

The systemic risk of\nsupply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and\ndynamics of supply chain networks (SCN).

In this thesis, we\nintroduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through\nMath-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and\nemploys a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality\nEstimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and\ndeformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently\nenhanced in two phases.

However, existing LBO approaches\noften suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the\nreconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy\nproblem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based\nBayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative\nmodel to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the\nlatent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the\nreconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive\nnormalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate\nsampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each\ntoken based on its importance. Through extensive experiments, our NF-BO method\ndemonstrates superior performance in molecule generation tasks, significantly\noutperforming both traditional and recent LBO approaches.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,cs.AI","published":"2025-04-21T06:36:09Z"}

However, the\nformation mechanisms of these post-peak bumps remain a matter of debate.\nFurthermore, previous studies employing the magnetar-powered model have\ntypically assumed a fixed magnetic inclination angle and neglected the effects\nof magnetar precession. However, recent research has shown that the precession\nof newborn magnetars forming during the collapse of massive stars causes the\nmagnetic inclination angle to evolve over time, thereby influencing magnetic\ndipole radiation. In this paper, therefore, we incorporate the effects of\nmagnetar precession into the magnetar-powered model to develop the precessing\nmagnetar-powered model.

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked\nAutoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is\npretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and\nevaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition,\nand Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that\nintegrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves\npretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch.

For this purpose, modern programming languages provide\nstrongly-consistent shared objects. To account for their many usages, these\nobjects offer a large API.However, in practice, each program calls only a tiny\nfraction of the interface. Leveraging such an observation, we propose to tailor\na shared object for a specific usage. We call this principle adjusted objects.\nAdjusted objects already exist in the wild.

We\npresent the formal foundations of adjusted objects using a new tool to\ncharacterize scalability, the indistinguishability graph.

However, some\nnumerical simulations have shown that the resulting distribution of electrons\nis a combination of a thermal component and a non-thermal power-law component.\nIn this paper, we investigate synchrotron circular polarization using such a\nhybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons\nwithin a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt optical emission. Our\nresults show that compared to the solely nonthermal electron model, the\nsynchrotron circular polarization degree (PD) in the hybrid electron model can\nvary widely in the optical band, depending on different parameters. The lower\nthe electron temperature, the higher the circular PD. The time-averaged\ncircular PD in the hybrid electron model can be higher than $\\sim 1\\%$ when the\nelectron temperature is as low as $\\sim 10^{10}$ K, while in the solely\nnonthermal electron model is usually lower than $\\sim 1\\%$. We further\ncalculate the radiative transfer of the circular and linear polarization in the\noptical band.

To further examine the physical mechanisms of both\nradiation and particle acceleration, we expect that instruments will be capable\nof measuring the circular polarization of GRB prompt optical emission in the\nfuture.","main_category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":"astro-ph.HE","published":"2025-04-28T14:44:29Z"}

However, a generic way to construct multiple mobility edges\n(MME) is still ambiguous and lacking. In this work, we propose a brief scheme\nto engineer both real and complex exact multiple mobility edges exploiting a\nfew coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains. We study the\nextended-localized transitions of coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains\nalong the chain direction. The model combines both the well-established\nquasiperiodicity and a kind of freshly introduced staggered non-reciprocity,\nwhich are aligned in two mutually perpendicular directions, within a unified\nframework. Based on analytical analysis, we predict that when the couplings\nbetween quasiperiodic chains are weak, the system will be in a mixed phase in\nwhich the localized states and extended states coexist and intertwine, thus\nlacking explicit energy separations. However, as the inter-chain couplings\nincrease to certain strength, exact multiple mobility edges emerge. This\nprediction is clearly verified by concrete numerical calculations of the\nFractal Dimension and the scaling index $\\beta$. Moreover, we show that the\ncombination of quasiperiodicity and the staggered non-reciprocity can be\nutilized to design and realize quantum states of various configurations.

Unlike\ntraditional ground-based settings, UAVs capture actions from a wide range of\naltitudes, resulting in considerable appearance discrepancies. We introduce a\nmulti-view formulation tailored to varying UAV altitudes and empirically\nobserve a partial order among views, where recognition accuracy consistently\ndecreases as the altitude increases. This motivates a novel approach that\nexplicitly models the hierarchical structure of UAV views to improve\nrecognition performance across altitudes. To this end, we propose the Partial\nOrder Guided Multi-View Network (POG-MVNet), designed to address drastic view\nvariations by effectively leveraging view-dependent information across\ndifferent altitude levels. The framework comprises three key components: a View\nPartition (VP) module, which uses the head-to-body ratio to group views by\naltitude; an Order-aware Feature Decoupling (OFD) module, which disentangles\naction-relevant and view-specific features under partial order guidance; and an\nAction Partial Order Guide (APOG), which leverages the partial order to\ntransfer informative knowledge from easier views to support learning in more\nchallenging ones. We conduct experiments on Drone-Action, MOD20, and UAV\ndatasets, demonstrating that POG-MVNet significantly outperforms competing\nmethods. For example, POG-MVNet achieves a 4.7% improvement on Drone-Action\ndataset and a 3.5% improvement on UAV dataset compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods ASAT and FAR.

We consider two different equations of\nstate (EOSs), one is the MIT bag model EOS and the other is EOS-A. Our study\nexamines the impact of the pressure anisotropy on the equilibrium structure, as\nwell as on the frequencies and damping times of f-mode oscillations. Our\nresults confirm that the f-mode frequency scales linearly with the square root\nof the average density, with anisotropy influencing both the slope and\nintercept of this relation. The dependence of the f-mode frequency on total\nmass reveals distinct trends based on the relative dominance of tangential and\nradial pressure. When the tangential pressure exceeds the radial pressure, the\nfrequency increases with mass, exhibiting rapid growth for massive quark stars.\nWhen the radial pressure dominates, the frequency increases with mass; however,\nin cases where the radial pressure is significantly greater than the tangential\npressure, the frequency decreases as mass increases. For low-mass quark stars,\nstronger tangential pressure leads to an increase in frequency, while beyond a\nthreshold mass, a further increase in tangential pressure results in a decrease\nin frequency. For the chosen range of anisotropic strengths, the frequency\nvaries between 1.3 kHz and 2.3 kHz for the MIT bag EOS and between 1.8 kHz and\n3.4 kHz for EOS-A. We find that the normalized damping time follows a linear\ntrend with compactness.

Here we investigate SHA\nusing the two-dimensional sine-Gordon (2D-sG) model and microcanonical\ninflection point analysis (MIPA), uncovering two key results. First, we show\nthat the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT\nunder MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous.

In this setup, the learner communicates the\nchosen arm to play to an agent over an erasure channel with probability\n$\\epsilon \\in [0,1)$; if an erasure occurs, the agent continues pulling the\nlast successfully received arm; the learner always observes the reward of the\narm pulled. In past work, we considered the case where the agent cannot convey\nfeedback to the learner, and thus the learner does not know whether the arm\nplayed is the requested or the last successfully received one. In this paper,\nwe instead consider the case where the agent can send feedback to the learner\non whether the arm request was received, and thus the learner exactly knows\nwhich arm was played. Surprisingly, we prove that erasure feedback does not\nimprove the worst-case regret upper bound order over the previously studied\nno-feedback setting. In particular, we prove a regret lower bound of\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{KT} + K / (1 - \\epsilon))$, where $K$ is the number of arms and\n$T$ the time horizon, that matches no-feedback upper bounds up to logarithmic\nfactors. We note however that the availability of feedback enables simpler\nalgorithm designs that may achieve better constants (albeit not better order)\nregret bounds; we design one such algorithm and evaluate its performance\nnumerically.","main_category":"cs.LG","categories":"cs.LG,stat.ML","published":"2025-04-29T16:10:05Z"}

We were able to identify\ndepression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating\ncurve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and\nsuicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852).

It generates extensive video data that requires significant review\ntime, and localizing the capsule after ingestion is a challenge. Techniques\nlike bleeding detection and depth estimation can help with localization of\npathologies, but deep learning models are typically too large to run directly\non the capsule. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) for bleeding segmentation and\ndepth estimation are trained on capsule endoscopic images. For monocular depth\nestimation, we distill a large foundation model into the lean NCA architecture,\nby treating the outputs of the foundation model as pseudo ground truth. We then\nport the trained NCA to the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling efficient image\nprocessing on hardware as small as a camera capsule. NCA are more accurate\n(Dice) than other portable segmentation models, while requiring more than 100x\nfewer parameters stored in memory than other small-scale models. The visual\nresults of NCA depth estimation look convincing, and in some cases beat the\nrealism and detail of the pseudo ground truth. Runtime optimizations on the\nESP32-S3 accelerate the average inference speed significantly, by more than\nfactor 3. With several algorithmic adjustments and distillation, it is possible\nto eNCApsulate NCA models into microcontrollers that fit into wireless capsule\nendoscopes.

However, a\nfundamental issue arises: Individuals typically perceive participation as\nadvantageous only after an institution is established, creating a paradox: How\ncan institutions form if no one will join before a critical mass exists? We\nterm this conundrum the institution bootstrapping problem and propose that\nmisperception, specifically, agents' erroneous belief that an institution\nalready exists, could resolve this paradox. By integrating well-documented\npsychological phenomena, including cognitive biases, probability distortion,\nand perceptual noise, into a game-theoretic framework, we demonstrate how these\nfactors collectively mitigate the bootstrapping problem. Notably, unbiased\nperceptual noise (e.g., noise arising from agents' heterogeneous physical or\nsocial contexts) drastically reduces the critical mass of cooperators required\nfor institutional emergence. This effect intensifies with greater diversity of\nperceptions. We explain this counter-intuitive result through asymmetric\nboundary conditions: proportional underestimation of low-probability sanctions\nproduces distinct outcomes compared to equivalent overestimation. Furthermore,\nthe type of perceptual distortion, proportional versus absolute, yields\nqualitatively different evolutionary pathways. These findings challenge\nconventional assumptions about rationality in institutional design,\nhighlighting how \"noisy\" cognition can paradoxically enhance cooperation.\nFinally, we contextualize these insights within broader discussions of\nmulti-agent system design and collective action.

Among the quantum algorithms, quantum annealing is a\nprime candidate to solve optimisation problems.

In the last few\nyears, asteroseismology has enabled the measurement of strong magnetic fields\n$10^4$--$10^6\\,\\mathrm{G}$ in the cores of dozens of red giants, and is the\nonly known way to directly measure internal stellar magnetic fields. However,\ncurrent data are still interpreted assuming that these fields are too weak or\ntoo axisymmetric to affect the orientation of the pulsations (i.e., make the\npulsations ``oblique''), rendering stronger field strengths beyond the reach of\nexisting asteroseismic searches. We show that, even when an oblique pulsator is\nalso stochastic (such as in a red giant with a strong non-axisymmetric magnetic\nfield), geometric effects will cause the signal to contain frequency components\nwhich remain in perfect relative phase with each other. This perfect phase\nrelationship persists even over timescales in which stochasticity erases\nabsolute phase information. This perfect relative coherence is a distinctive\nobservational signature of oblique pulsation that does not require a model for\nmode frequencies to search for. However, due to its dependence on phase, this\neffect will not be evident in the power spectral density alone, and phase\ninformation should be retained in order to detect it. Coherence-based searches\nfor oblique pulsations may pave the way to measurements of magnetic fields of\ncurrently inaccessible strengths in red giants, as well as some main-sequence\nand compact pulsators.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-05-06T04:27:57Z"}

The task is turn-based,\nmulti-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its\nlong-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated\ndynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play\n(HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates\ncentralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level\nmotion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to\nenable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert\ndemonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level\nstrategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint\nfine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior\nperformance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based\nhierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\\% win rate and a 71.5\\% win rate\nagainst the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team\nbehaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.","main_category":"cs.AI","categories":"cs.AI","published":"2025-05-07T11:04:36Z"}

Exploiting this\ninsight, we propose a novel dehazing framework, WDMamba, which decomposes the\nimage dehazing task into two sequential stages: low-frequency restoration\nfollowed by detail enhancement. This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to\neffectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process,\nresulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency\nrestoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures\nwith linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a\ncoarse restored image. Thereafter, the detail enhancement stage reinstates\nfine-grained information that may have been overlooked during the previous\nphase, culminating in the final dehazed output. Furthermore, to enhance detail\nretention and achieve more natural dehazing, we introduce a self-guided\ncontrastive regularization during network training.

One common practice for this end is\nconstructing a convolutional backbone to enable interactions with skip\nconnections among feature extraction layers. The de facto structure, U-Net-like\nnetworks, has attempted to design skip connections such as nested or full-scale\nones to connect one single encoder and one single decoder to improve its\nrepresentation capacity. Despite being effective, it still does not fully\nexplore interactions with a single encoder and decoder architectures. In this\npaper, we embrace this observation and introduce a simple yet effective\nalternative strategy to enhance the representations for registrations by\nappending one additional decoder. The new decoder is designed to interact with\nboth the original encoder and decoder. In this way, it not only reuses feature\npresentation from corresponding layers in the encoder but also interacts with\nthe original decoder to corporately give more accurate registration results.\nThe new architecture is concise yet generalized, with only one encoder and two\ndecoders forming a ``Tetrahedron'' structure, thereby dubbed Tetrahedron-Net.\nThree instantiations of Tetrahedron-Net are further constructed regarding the\ndifferent structures of the appended decoder. Our extensive experiments prove\nthat superior performance can be obtained on several representative benchmarks\nof medical image registration. Finally, such a ``Tetrahedron'' design can also\nbe easily integrated into popular U-Net-like architectures including\nVoxelMorph, ViT-V-Net, and TransMorph, leading to consistent performance gains.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV,cs.IR","published":"2025-05-07T13:00:49Z"}

For\nsoft robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states are\ninherently infinite-dimensional functions due to the robots' continuous\ndeformability. Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide\ndiscrete measurements. Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a\nboundary observer was introduced, which leverages Cosserat rod theory to\nrecover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the velocity twist at\nthe robot's tip. In this work, we present a novel boundary observer that can\nalso recover infinite-dimensional dynamic states, but instead relies on\nmeasuring the internal wrench at the robot's base. This design exploits the\nduality between the velocity twist at the tip and the internal wrench at the\nbase, with both types of boundary observers being inspired by principles of\nenergy dissipation. Despite the mathematical duality, the proposed approach\noffers a distinct advantage: it requires only a 6-axis force/torque sensor\nembedded at the base, eliminating the need for external sensing systems such as\nmotion capture cameras. Moreover, combining both tip- and base-based techniques\nenhances energy dissipation, accelerates convergence, and improves estimation\naccuracy. We validate the proposed algorithms through both simulation studies\nand experiments based on tendon-driven continuum robots. Our results\ndemonstrate that all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3\nseconds, even with significantly deviated initial conditions. Furthermore, they\nrecover from unknown perturbations and effectively track high-frequency\nvibrations. We also show that combining the dual techniques further improves\nconvergence speed and accuracy.

The Kramers\nions excitations consist of doublets due to the Kramers degeneracy theorem\nwhile the non-Kramers ions excitations are non-degenerated singlets. The\nground-state doublets of all Kramers ions undergo peak splitting and generate\nlow energy excitation peaks ~ 1 meV under the internal magnetic fields from the\nFe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices. The ground-states of non-Kramers ions may\nform pseudo doublets due to the accidental degeneracy of two singlet states, as\nthe case of Ho$^{3+}$ in HoFeO$_3$. Such pseudo-doublet ground states can split\nand produce low energy excitations just like the Kramers ions. However, singlet\nground states of non-Kramers ions without accidental degeneracy, like\nPr$^{3+}$, has no ground state excitation and splitting at zero fields. A\nground-state singlet excitation shows up under non-zero magnetic fields due to\nthe symmetry breaking induced by the magnetic fields. The internal/external\nmagnetic field effects on CF excitations in REFeO$_3$ demonstrate strong\nanisotropies. The local symmetry was confirmed to play the critical role in the\nCF excitation splitting and anisotropic responses to magnetic fields in\nREFeO$_{3}$.

However, as dynamic\nvision sensors, their output is inherently noisy, making efficient denoising\nessential to preserve their ultra-low latency and real-time processing\ncapabilities. Existing event denoising methods struggle with a critical\ndilemma: computationally intensive approaches compromise the sensor's\nhigh-speed advantage, while lightweight methods often lack robustness across\nvarying noise levels. To address this, we propose a novel event denoising\nframework based on State Space Models (SSMs). Our approach represents events as\n4D event clouds and includes a Coarse Feature Extraction (CFE) module that\nextracts embedding features from both geometric and polarity-aware subspaces.\nThe model is further composed of two essential components: A Spatial Mamba\n(S-SSM) that models local geometric structures and a Temporal Mamba (T-SSM)\nthat captures global temporal dynamics, efficiently propagating spatiotemporal\nfeatures across events. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, with 88.89K parameters, 0.0685s per\n100K events inference time, and a 0.982 accuracy score, outperforming\nTransformer-based methods by 2.08% in denoising accuracy and 36X faster.","main_category":"cs.CV","categories":"cs.CV","published":"2025-05-08T16:27:27Z"}

By properly reformulating\ndiscretized DOT problems into a linear SOCP, the proposed method eliminates the\ninterpolation matrices and thus avoids solving a series of cubic equations and\nlinear systems induced by interpolation. Then, by taking advantage of the SOCP\nreformulation, we can solve them efficiently by a computationally highly\neconomical implementation of an inexact decomposition-based proximal augmented\nLagrangian method. Moreover, we have made the proposed approach an open-source\nsoftware package. Numerical experiments on various DOT problems suggest that\nthe proposed approach performs significantly more efficiently than\nstate-of-the-art software packages. In addition, it exhibits prominent\nrobustness to problems with non-negative measures.","main_category":"math.OC","categories":"math.OC","published":"2025-05-08T17:13:41Z"}

While the Markovian approximation simplifies\nthe analysis of noise, it remains computationally demanding, particularly for\nhigh-dimensional systems like quantum memories. In this paper, we present a\nstatistical approach to study the impact of different noise models on\nentanglement in composite quantum systems. By comparing global and local noise\nscenarios, we quantify entanglement degradation using the Positive Partial\nTranspose Time (PPTT) metric, which measures how long entanglement persists\nunder noise. When the sampling of different noise scenarios is performed under\ncontrolled and homogeneous conditions, our analysis reveals that systems\nsubjected to global noise tend to exhibit longer PPTTs, whereas those\ninfluenced by independent local noise models display the shortest entanglement\npersistence. To carry out this analysis, we employ a computational method\nproposed by Cao and Lu, which accelerates the simulation of PPTT distributions\nand enables efficient analysis of systems with dimensions up to $D=8$. Our\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for investigating the\nresilience of quantum systems under Markovian noise.","main_category":"quant-ph","categories":"quant-ph","published":"2025-05-08T17:21:39Z"}

The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and\nEulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations\nthrough which the accuracy of the convective power spectrum can be evaluated.\nThis validation process shows that the power spectrum diverges significantly\nfrom ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic\ndegree $\\ell=15$ - $30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic\nmeasurements. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\\ell<15$)\nis sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data and find\na spectrum that is substantially stronger than previously reported. We discuss\nsome possible differences in methodology that might have led to the initial\nunder-estimation of solar convective power. The new spectra are in line with\nrecent hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection and\nalso consistent with the previous inferences obtained by the ring-diagram\nlocal-helioseismology method.","main_category":"astro-ph.SR","categories":"astro-ph.SR","published":"2025-05-08T17:45:17Z"}

The unconventional skin modes display scale-restricted localization,\ndistinguishing them from the critical NHSE. Upon introducing an external\nmagnetic field coupled to the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional\nskin modes are suppressed, leading to spectral instability and the emergence of\ncritical NHSE with system size-dependent non-Bloch spectra.
