The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\\\\'enyi mutual\\ninformation using as input the correlations computed from the continuous\\nwavelet transform. We show for free massless fermionic and bosonic QFTs that\\nthe emerging metric is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (AdS), and that the\\nparameters fixing the geometry are tunable by changing the chosen wavelet\\nbasis. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be\\nconformal field theories.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:04:54Z\"}"}
