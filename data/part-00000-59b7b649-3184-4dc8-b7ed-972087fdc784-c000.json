In optics, they are key to\\nmanipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from\\nimaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the\\noptimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to\\na purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical\\nnon-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the\\ncontrol and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs\\n-- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence\\nrate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained\\nusing classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state.\\nBeyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential\\nto tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with\\nmulti-spin interactions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:31:18Z\"}"}
