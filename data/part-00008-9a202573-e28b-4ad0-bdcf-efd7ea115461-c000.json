{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07429v1\", \"title\": \"DS-Pnet: FM-Based Positioning via Downsampling\", \"summary\": \"In this paper we present DS-Pnet, a novel framework for FM signal-based\\npositioning that addresses the challenges of high computational complexity and\\nlimited deployment in resource-constrained environments. Two downsampling\\nmethods-IQ signal downsampling and time-frequency representation\\ndownsampling-are proposed to reduce data dimensionality while preserving\\ncritical positioning features. By integrating with the lightweight MobileViT-XS\\nneural network, the framework achieves high positioning accuracy with\\nsignificantly reduced computational demands. Experiments on real-world FM\\nsignal datasets demonstrate that DS-Pnet achieves superior performance in both\\nindoor and outdoor scenarios, with space and time complexity reductions of\\napproximately 87% and 99.5%, respectively, compared to an existing method,\\nFM-Pnet. Despite the high compression, DS-Pnet maintains robust positioning\\naccuracy, offering an optimal balance between efficiency and precision.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T03:49:24Z\"}"}
