Here, we develop a\\ncryogenic-compatible strain-engineering platform based on a\\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp that is not obviously working properly at\\ncryogenic temperature. In-situ three-dimensional (3D) strain control is\\nachieved for quantum dots (QDs) embedded in photonic nanostructures. The\\ncompliant PDMS enables independent tuning of emission energy and elimination of\\nfine structure splitting (FSS) of single QDs, as demonstrated by a 7 meV\\nspectral shift with a near-vanishing FSS in circular Bragg resonators and an\\nunprecedented 15 meV tuning range in the micropillar. The PDMS-based 3D\\nstrain-engineering platform, compatible with diverse photonic structures at\\ncryogenic temperature, provides a powerful and versatile tool for exploring\\nfundamental strain-related physics and advancing integrated photonic quantum\\ntechnology.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T04:00:25Z\"}"}
