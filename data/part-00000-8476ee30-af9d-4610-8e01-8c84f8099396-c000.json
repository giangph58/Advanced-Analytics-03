In fact, they define such\\nan algebra $A(\\\\mathfrak{g})$ for each simple Lie algebra $\\\\mathfrak{g}$, in\\nterms of explicit but ad-hoc formulas.\\n  We discovered that their algebras $A(\\\\mathfrak{g})$ have a natural\\ninterpretation in terms of affine vertex algebras, and their ad-hoc formulas\\ntake an extremely simple form in this new interpretation. It is our hope that\\nthis point of view will lead to a better understanding of this interesting\\nclass of algebras.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.GR,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:56:23Z\"}"}
