{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05644v1\", \"title\": \"iEBAKER: Improved Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval Framework via\\n  Eliminate Before Align and Keyword Explicit Reasoning\", \"summary\": \"Recent studies focus on the Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR),\\nwhich aims at searching for the corresponding targets based on the given query.\\nAmong these efforts, the application of Foundation Models (FMs), such as CLIP,\\nto the domain of remote sensing has yielded encouraging outcomes. However,\\nexisting FM based methodologies neglect the negative impact of weakly\\ncorrelated sample pairs and fail to account for the key distinctions among\\nremote sensing texts, leading to biased and superficial exploration of sample\\npairs. To address these challenges, we propose an approach named iEBAKER (an\\nImproved Eliminate Before Align strategy with Keyword Explicit Reasoning\\nframework) for RSITR. Specifically, we propose an innovative Eliminate Before\\nAlign (EBA) strategy to filter out the weakly correlated sample pairs, thereby\\nmitigating their deviations from optimal embedding space during\\nalignment.Further, two specific schemes are introduced from the perspective of\\nwhether local similarity and global similarity affect each other. On this\\nbasis, we introduce an alternative Sort After Reversed Retrieval (SAR)\\nstrategy, aims at optimizing the similarity matrix via reverse retrieval.\\nAdditionally, we incorporate a Keyword Explicit Reasoning (KER) module to\\nfacilitate the beneficial impact of subtle key concept distinctions. Without\\nbells and whistles, our approach enables a direct transition from FM to RSITR\\ntask, eliminating the need for additional pretraining on remote sensing data.\\nExtensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate\\nthat our proposed iEBAKER method surpasses the state-of-the-art models while\\nrequiring less training data. Our source code will be released at\\nhttps://github.com/zhangy0822/iEBAKER.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:40:19Z\"}"}
