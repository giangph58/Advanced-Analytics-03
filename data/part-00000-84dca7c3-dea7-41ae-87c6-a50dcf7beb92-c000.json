This\\npaper introduces a computationally efficient method to make the LBF estimator\\nrobust, enhancing its resistance to impulsive noise. First, the choice of basis\\nfunctions is optimized based on the knowledge of parameter variation\\nstatistics. Then, the parameter tracking algorithm is made robust using the\\nsequential data trimming technique. Finally, it is demonstrated that the\\nproposed algorithm can undergo online tuning through parallel estimation and\\nleave-one-out cross-validation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T09:37:58Z\"}"}
