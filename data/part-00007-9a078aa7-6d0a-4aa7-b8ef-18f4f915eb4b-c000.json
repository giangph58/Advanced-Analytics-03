The inference relies on time-delay embedding, estimation of\\nthe intrinsic dimension of the observed systems, and their mutual dimension. A\\nkey component of our approach is a new anisotropic training technique applied\\nto Kohonen's self-organizing map, which effectively learns the attractor of the\\ndriven system and separates it into submanifolds corresponding to the\\nself-dynamics and shared dynamics.\\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted simulated\\nexperiments using different chaotic maps in a setup, where two chaotic maps\\nwere driven by a third map with nonlinear coupling. The inferred time series\\nexhibited high correlation with the time series of the actual hidden common\\ndriver, in contrast to the observed systems. The quality of our reconstruction\\nwere compared and shown to be superior to several other methods that are\\nintended to find the common features behind the observed time series, including\\nlinear methods like PCA and ICA as well as nonlinear methods like dynamical\\ncomponent analysis, canonical correlation analysis and even deep canonical\\ncorrelation analysis.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:17:23Z\"}"}
