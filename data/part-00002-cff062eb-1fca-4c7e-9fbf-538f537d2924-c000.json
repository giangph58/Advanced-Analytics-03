In this paper, we use the\\nrestriction of the SRG to particular input spaces to compute\\nfrequency-dependent gain bounds for incrementally stable nonlinear systems.\\nThis leads to a nonlinear (NL) generalization of the Bode diagram, where the\\nsinusoidal, harmonic, and subharmonic inputs are considered separately. When\\napplied to the analysis of the NL loop transfer and sensitivity, we define a\\nnotion of bandwidth for both the open-loop and closed-loop, compatible with the\\nLTI definitions. We illustrate the power of our method on the analysis of a DC\\nmotor with a parasitic nonlinearity, verifying our results in simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T10:41:49Z\"}"}
