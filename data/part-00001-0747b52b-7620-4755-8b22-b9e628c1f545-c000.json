{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06677v1\", \"title\": \"Setup-Invariant Augmented Reality for Teaching by Demonstration with\\n  Surgical Robots\", \"summary\": \"Augmented reality (AR) is an effective tool in robotic surgery education as\\nit combines exploratory learning with three-dimensional guidance. However,\\nexisting AR systems require expert supervision and do not account for\\ndifferences in the mentor and mentee robot configurations. To enable novices to\\ntrain outside the operating room while receiving expert-informed guidance, we\\npresent dV-STEAR: an open-source system that plays back task-aligned expert\\ndemonstrations without assuming identical setup joint positions between expert\\nand novice. Pose estimation was rigorously quantified, showing a registration\\nerror of 3.86 (SD=2.01)mm. In a user study (N=24), dV-STEAR significantly\\nimproved novice performance on tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic\\nSurgery. In a single-handed ring-over-wire task, dV-STEAR increased completion\\nspeed (p=0.03) and reduced collision time (p=0.01) compared to dry-lab training\\nalone. During a pick-and-place task, it improved success rates (p=0.004).\\nAcross both tasks, participants using dV-STEAR exhibited significantly more\\nbalanced hand use and reported lower frustration levels. This work presents a\\nnovel educational tool implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrates\\nits effectiveness in teaching novices, and builds the foundation for further AR\\nintegration into robot-assisted surgery.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.CV,cs.HC,cs.SY,eess.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:34:25Z\"}"}
