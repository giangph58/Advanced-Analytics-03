{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05987v1\", \"title\": \"Learning-enhanced electronic skin for tactile sensing on deformable\\n  surface based on electrical impedance tomography\", \"summary\": \"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)-based tactile sensors offer\\ncost-effective and scalable solutions for robotic sensing, especially promising\\nfor soft robots. However a major issue of EIT-based tactile sensors when\\napplied in highly deformable objects is their performance degradation due to\\nsurface deformations. This limitation stems from their inherent sensitivity to\\nstrain, which is particularly exacerbated in soft bodies, thus requiring\\ndedicated data interpretation to disentangle the parameter being measured and\\nthe signal deriving from shape changes. This has largely limited their\\npractical implementations. This paper presents a machine learning-assisted\\ntactile sensing approach to address this challenge by tracking surface\\ndeformations and segregating this contribution in the signal readout during\\ntactile sensing. We first capture the deformations of the target object,\\nfollowed by tactile reconstruction using a deep learning model specifically\\ndesigned to process and fuse EIT data and deformation information. Validations\\nusing numerical simulations achieved high correlation coefficients (0.9660 -\\n0.9999), peak signal-to-noise ratios (28.7221 - 55.5264 dB) and low relative\\nimage errors (0.0107 - 0.0805). Experimental validations, using a\\nhydrogel-based EIT e-skin under various deformation scenarios, further\\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world settings.\\nThe findings could underpin enhanced tactile interaction in soft and highly\\ndeformable robotic applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:49:54Z\"}"}
