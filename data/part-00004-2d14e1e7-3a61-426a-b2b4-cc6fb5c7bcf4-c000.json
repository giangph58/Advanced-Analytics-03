The description of\\nthe totally geodesic submanifolds of $G_2$ is in terms of (1) principal\\nsubalgebras of $\\\\mathfrak{g}_2$; (2) stabilizers of nonzero points of\\n$\\\\mathbb{R}^7$; (3) stabilizers of associative subalgebras; (4) the set of\\norder two elements in $G_2$ (and its translations). The space $G_2/SO(4)$ is\\nidentified with the set of associative subalgebras of $\\\\mathbb{R}^7$ and its\\nmaximal totally geodesic submanifolds can be described as the associative\\nsubalgebras adapted to a fixed principal subalgebra, the associative\\nsubalgebras orthogonal to a fixed nonzero vector, the associative subalgebras\\ncontaining a fixed nonzero vector, and the associative subalgebras intersecting\\nboth a fixed associative subalgebra and its orthogonal. A second description is\\nincluded in terms of Grassmannians, the advantage of which is that the\\nassociated Lie triple systems are easily described in matrix form.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:28:50Z\"}"}
