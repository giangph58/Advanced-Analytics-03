So far, experimental progress on light-field dressed states\\nhas been mainly focused on the occupied states, however, it is unclear if the\\ntransient photo-excited states above the Fermi energy $E_F$ can also be\\ndressed, leaving the dynamical interplay between photo-excitation and\\nlight-field dressing elusive. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence for\\nlight-field dressing of the transient photo-excited surface states above $E_F$,\\nwhich exhibits distinct dynamics with a delay response as compared to\\nlight-field dressed states below $E_F$. Our work reveals the dual roles of the\\npump pulse in both photo-excitation and light-field dressing, providing a more\\ncomprehensive picture with new insights on the light-induced manipulation of\\ntransient electronic states.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:34:14Z\"}"}
