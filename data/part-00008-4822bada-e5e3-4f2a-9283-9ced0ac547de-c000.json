{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07660v1\", \"title\": \"End-to-End Facial Expression Detection in Long Videos\", \"summary\": \"Facial expression detection involves two interrelated tasks: spotting, which\\nidentifies the onset and offset of expressions, and recognition, which\\nclassifies them into emotional categories. Most existing methods treat these\\ntasks separately using a two-step training pipelines. A spotting model first\\ndetects expression intervals. A recognition model then classifies the detected\\nsegments. However, this sequential approach leads to error propagation,\\ninefficient feature learning, and suboptimal performance due to the lack of\\njoint optimization of the two tasks. We propose FEDN, an end-to-end Facial\\nExpression Detection Network that jointly optimizes spotting and recognition.\\nOur model introduces a novel attention-based feature extraction module,\\nincorporating segment attention and sliding window attention to improve facial\\nfeature learning. By unifying two tasks within a single network, we greatly\\nreduce error propagation and enhance overall performance. Experiments on\\nCASME}^2 and CASME^3 demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for both spotting\\nand detection, underscoring the benefits of joint optimization for robust\\nfacial expression detection in long videos.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:18:46Z\"}"}
