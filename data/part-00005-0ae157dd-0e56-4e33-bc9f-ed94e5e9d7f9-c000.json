{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04807v1\", \"title\": \"Fast gates for bit-flip protected superconducting qubits\", \"summary\": \"Superconducting qubits offer an unprecedentedly high degree of flexibility in\\nterms of circuit encoding and parameter choices. However, in designing the\\nqubit parameters one typically faces the conflicting goals of long coherence\\ntimes and simple control capabilities. Both are determined by the wavefunction\\noverlap of the qubit basis states and the corresponding matrix elements. Here,\\nwe address this problem by introducing a qubit architecture with real-time\\ntunable bit-flip protection. In the first, the `heavy' regime, the energy\\nrelaxation time can be on the order of hours for fluxons located in two\\nnear-degenerate ground states, as recently demonstrated in Ref. [Hassani et\\nal., Nat.~Commun.~14 (2023)]. The second, `light' regime, on the other hand\\nfacilitates high-fidelity control on nanosecond timescales without the need for\\nmicrowave signals. We propose two different tuning mechanisms of the qubit\\npotential and show that base-band flux-pulses of around 10 ns are sufficient to\\nrealize a universal set of high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We expect\\nthat the concept of real-time wavefunction control can also be applied to other\\nhardware-protected qubit designs.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.supr-con\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:03:19Z\"}"}
