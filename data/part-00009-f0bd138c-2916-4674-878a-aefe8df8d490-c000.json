Estimating the error requires classical simulations, which\\nbecome unfeasible in the Quantum Supremacy regime. We leverage Machine Learning\\ndata-driven approaches and Conformal Prediction, a Machine Learning uncertainty\\nquantification tool known for its mild assumptions and finite-sample validity,\\nto find theoretically valid upper bounds of the fidelity between noiseless and\\nnoisy outputs of quantum devices. Under reasonable extrapolation assumptions,\\nthe proposed scheme applies to any Quantum Computing hardware, does not require\\nmodeling the device's noise sources, and can be used when classical simulations\\nare unavailable, e.g. in the Quantum Supremacy regime.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:27:52Z\"}"}
