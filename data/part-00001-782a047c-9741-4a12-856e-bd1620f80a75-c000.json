As the Square\\nKilometre Array (SKA) radio telescopes come fully operational, we anticipate\\nthe generation of hundreds of petabytes of data annually, characterized by\\nunprecedented resolution and detail. In this context, scientific visualization\\nbecomes a critical component, enabling researchers to interpret complex\\ndatasets and extract meaningful insights. The immense volume of data demands\\nnot only suitable tools but also substantial infrastructure and computational\\ncapacity to analyze it effectively. In this work, we will discuss how we are\\naddressing these challenges with the development of our interactive\\nvisualization tool named VisIVO Visual Analytics. The tool is transitioning\\nfrom a local visualizer to a remote visualizer, utilizing a client-server\\narchitecture. This evolution will allow the software to run parallel\\nvisualization pipelines on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, thereby\\nenhancing its capacity to handle extensive datasets efficiently.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:04:53Z\"}"}
