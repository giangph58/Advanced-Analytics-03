{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06173v1\", \"title\": \"Multi-Modality Sensing in mmWave Beamforming for Connected Vehicles\\n  Using Deep Learning\", \"summary\": \"Beamforming techniques are considered as essential parts to compensate severe\\npath losses in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. In particular, these\\ntechniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain\\nsatisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over\\nnarrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined\\nbeam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and\\nbeam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and\\ncommunications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential\\nuse in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\\ncommunications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing\\nout-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor\\ndevices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents\\na deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data\\nfor predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so\\nthat the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The\\nproposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and\\ncommunication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19%\\naccuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to\\nexisting been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time\\noverheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively\\nwhich confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled\\ncommunications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI,cs.AI,cs.ET,cs.LG,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:18:00Z\"}"}
