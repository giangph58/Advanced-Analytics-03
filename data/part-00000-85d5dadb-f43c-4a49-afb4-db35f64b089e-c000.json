{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21667v1\", \"title\": \"The Construction of Asymptotic Bode Plots: A New Direct Method\", \"summary\": \"Bode plots represent an essential tool in control and systems engineering. In\\norder to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the\\nconstruction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods\\nfor constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks:\\nthey are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because\\nthey require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the\\nconsidered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are\\nrequired as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for\\nthe construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the\\nsystematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions\\nand on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to\\nas a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode\\nmagnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring\\nthe detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter\\nfeature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more\\nprecise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when\\ndealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison\\nof the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in\\norder to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:33:52Z\"}"}
