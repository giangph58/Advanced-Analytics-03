{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02609v1\", \"title\": \"One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era\", \"summary\": \"The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the\\nconservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during\\ninflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure\\nfrom this property would require reinterpreting the data. This is why it is\\nimportant to understand how superhorizon perturbations interact with the\\nthermal plasma driving the radiation dominated Universe. We model the plasma by\\nfree photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the\\npower spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations. This correction grows in\\ntime and is not suppressed by any small parameter. While one-loop result is not\\nreliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially\\ninteresting effects that should be investigated further.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:10:50Z\"}"}
