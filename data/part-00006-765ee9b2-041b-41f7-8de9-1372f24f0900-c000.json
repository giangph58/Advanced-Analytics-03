Our simulations show that an average of\\n0.17-0.25 kilonova events can be observed over the entire O4 period of $\\\\sim 2$\\nyears in the most optimistic case we set, while no kilonova can be detected in\\nother cases. We note that it is beneficial for {\\\\it SiTian}'s kilonova\\nsearching by extending the exposure time to gain deeper limiting magnitude\\ndespite the rapid decline of kilonova luminosity.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:16Z\"}"}
