We demonstrate that soliton\\ncrystal states act as strong attractors, where pump depletion and pump phase\\nplay crucial roles in their stabilization by ensuring equal soliton spacing and\\ncoherence. The number of solitons is primarily determined by driving strength.\\nAdditionally, we identify a novel nonlinear state in parametric soliton\\ncrystals in which circulating solitons periodically alternate their intensities\\nand group velocities, a phenomenon we term the soliton-pursuing states.\\nFurthermore, due to the phase-selective nature of the optical parametric\\nprocess, we show how different configurations of soliton phases influence the\\noptical frequency combs, which may enable generating odd harmonic combs.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:32:23Z\"}"}
