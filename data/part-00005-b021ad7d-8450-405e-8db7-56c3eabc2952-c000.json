This study\\nintroduces a stochastic coupled Ekman-Stokes model (SCESM) developed within the\\nphysically consistent Location Uncertainty framework, explicitly incorporating\\nrandom turbulent fluctuations and surface wave effects. The SCESM integrates\\nestablished parameterizations for air-sea fluxes, turbulent viscosity, and\\nStokes drift, and its performance is rigorously assessed through ensemble\\nsimulations against LOTUS observational data. A performance ranking analysis\\nquantifies the impact of different model components, highlighting the critical\\nrole of explicit uncertainty representation in both oceanic and atmospheric\\ndynamics for accurately capturing system variability. Wave-induced mixing terms\\nimprove model performance, while wave-dependent surface roughness enhances\\nair-sea fluxes but reduces the relative influence of wave-driven mixing. This\\nfully coupled stochastic framework provides a foundation for advancing boundary\\nlayer parameterizations in large-scale climate models.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.ao-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:27:09Z\"}"}
