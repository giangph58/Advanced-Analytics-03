{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24300v1\", \"title\": \"Solving the Best Subset Selection Problem via Suboptimal Algorithms\", \"summary\": \"Best subset selection in linear regression is well known to be nonconvex and\\ncomputationally challenging to solve, as the number of possible subsets grows\\nrapidly with increasing dimensionality of the problem. As a result, finding the\\nglobal optimal solution via an exact optimization method for a problem with\\ndimensions of 1000s may take an impractical amount of CPU time. This suggests\\nthe importance of finding suboptimal procedures that can provide good\\napproximate solutions using much less computational effort than exact methods.\\nIn this work, we introduce a new procedure and compare it with other popular\\nsuboptimal algorithms to solve the best subset selection problem. Extensive\\ncomputational experiments using synthetic and real data have been performed.\\nThe results provide insights into the performance of these methods in different\\ndata settings. The new procedure is observed to be a competitive suboptimal\\nalgorithm for solving the best subset selection problem for high-dimensional\\ndata.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ML\", \"categories\": \"stat.ML,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:43:33Z\"}"}
