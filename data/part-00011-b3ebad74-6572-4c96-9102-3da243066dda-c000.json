First, based on\\nthe Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method for finite-dimensional functions, the\\ncorresponding bifurcation function is constructed, and it is proven that the\\nsystem possesses at least one T-periodic solution. Second, a two-timing method\\nis employed to perform perturbation analysis on the original equation. By\\nseparating the fast and slow time scales, an explicit expression for the\\napproximate T-periodic solution is derived. Furthermore, for the stability of\\nthe system under parametric excitation, the bifurcation characteristics near\\nthe first instability tongue are revealed through perturbation expansion and\\neigenvalue analysis. Additionally, the Ince-Strutt stability diagram is plotted\\nto illustrate the stability boundaries.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CA\", \"categories\": \"math.CA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:33:03Z\"}"}
