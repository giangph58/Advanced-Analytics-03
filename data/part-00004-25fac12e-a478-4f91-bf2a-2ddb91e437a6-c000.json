Trade flows\\nform a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and tariffs influence not only market\\noutcomes but also the structure of the global trade network. A numerical\\nexample illustrates how tariffs may eliminate targeted imports, divert trade\\nflows toward third markets, expose domestic firms to intensified foreign\\ncompetition abroad, reduce consumer welfare, and ultimately harm the country\\nimposing the tariff.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:13:26Z\"}"}
