The\\ndynamic programming algorithm gives us a table from which all LCSs can be\\nextracted by traceback. However, the need for quadratic space to hold this\\ntable can be an obstacle when dealing with long strings. A question that\\nnaturally arises in this situation would be whether it is possible to\\nexhaustively search for all LCSs one by one in a time-efficient manner using\\nonly a space linear in the LCS length, where we treat read-only memory for\\nstoring the strings as excluded from the space consumed. As a part of the\\nanswer to this question, we propose an $O(L)$-space algorithm that outputs all\\ndistinct LCSs of the strings one by one each in $O(n^2)$ time, where the\\nstrings are both of length $n$ and $L$ is the LCS length of the strings.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:17:55Z\"}"}
