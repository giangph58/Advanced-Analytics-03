{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01814v1\", \"title\": \"Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz\", \"summary\": \"Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling\\ninteracting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense\\nmatter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions\\nthat have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used\\nansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U\\n\\\\propto n^{\\\\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local\\nenergy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of\\nconfinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities\\nto $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest\\nthat models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more\\nreliable EoS construction.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,astro-ph.HE,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:20:03Z\"}"}
