Cold-atom analog experiments will\\nsoon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially\\nfar-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics.\\nHowever, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early\\nUniverse is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of\\nEuclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries\\ngenerically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment,\\nobscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate\\nthat implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely\\neliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our\\nfindings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the\\nlaboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas,astro-ph.CO,gr-qc,hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:59:59Z\"}"}
