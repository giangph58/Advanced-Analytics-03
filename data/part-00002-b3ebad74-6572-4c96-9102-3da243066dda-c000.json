{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01535v1\", \"title\": \"On Robust Empirical Likelihood for Nonparametric Regression with\\n  Application to Regression Discontinuity Designs\", \"summary\": \"Empirical likelihood serves as a powerful tool for constructing confidence\\nintervals in nonparametric regression and regression discontinuity designs\\n(RDD). The original empirical likelihood framework can be naturally extended to\\nthese settings using local linear smoothers, with Wilks' theorem holding only\\nwhen an undersmoothed bandwidth is selected. However, the generalization of\\nbias-corrected versions of empirical likelihood under more realistic conditions\\nis non-trivial and has remained an open challenge in the literature. This paper\\nprovides a satisfactory solution by proposing a novel approach, referred to as\\nrobust empirical likelihood, designed for nonparametric regression and RDD. The\\ncore idea is to construct robust weights which simultaneously achieve bias\\ncorrection and account for the additional variability introduced by the\\nestimated bias, thereby enabling valid confidence interval construction without\\nextra estimation steps involved. We demonstrate that the Wilks' phenomenon\\nstill holds under weaker conditions in nonparametric regression, sharp and\\nfuzzy RDD settings. Extensive simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of\\nour proposed approach, showing superior performance over existing methods in\\nterms of coverage probabilities and interval lengths. Moreover, the proposed\\nprocedure exhibits robustness to bandwidth selection, making it a flexible and\\nreliable tool for empirical analyses. The practical usefulness is further\\nillustrated through applications to two real datasets.\", \"main_category\": \"math.ST\", \"categories\": \"math.ST,econ.EM,stat.ME,stat.TH\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:22:18Z\"}"}
