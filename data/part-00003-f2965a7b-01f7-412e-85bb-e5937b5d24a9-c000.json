{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01446v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure\\n  Communications\", \"summary\": \"While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned\\nto enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient\\nsecurity design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather\\nchallenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization\\nperspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering\\nfactors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related\\nscenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure\\ncommunications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework.\\nSpecifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network\\n(GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through\\nthe message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through\\nsoft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security\\nbeamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation\\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security\\nperformance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy\\ndetermination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers\\na scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations,\\nestablishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled\\ncommunications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:57:33Z\"}"}
