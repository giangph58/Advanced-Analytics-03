In the limit of resistivity $\\\\varepsilon\\\\rightarrow 0$, we\\nprove the existence of two time scales for the evolution of the magnetic field:\\na fast one for times of order $\\\\log(\\\\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which the resistivity\\nplays no role and the energy is dissipated only via viscosity; and a slow one\\nfor times of order $\\\\varepsilon^{-1}$ characterized by the influence of the\\nresistivity. We show that in this second time scale, as $\\\\varepsilon\\\\rightarrow\\n0$, the modulus of magnetic field approaches a function that depends only on\\ntime. We also prove that, in this regime, the magnetic field\\n$b_\\\\varepsilon(t,x)$ can be approximated as $\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0$ by the\\nsolution of a PDE whose solutions exhibit blow up for some choices of initial\\ndata.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP,math-ph,math.MP,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:15:22Z\"}"}
