Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue typically involve\\ntraining on multiple microphone arrays, which can be costly. To address this\\nchallenge, we focus on uniform circular arrays and propose the use of a spatial\\nfilter bank to extract features that are approximately invariant to geometric\\nparameters. These features are then processed by a two-stage conformer-based\\nmodel (TSCBM) to enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that\\nour proposed method can be trained on a fixed microphone array while\\nmaintaining effective performance across uniform circular arrays with unseen\\ngeometric configurations during applications.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.AS\", \"categories\": \"eess.AS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T06:13:37Z\"}"}
