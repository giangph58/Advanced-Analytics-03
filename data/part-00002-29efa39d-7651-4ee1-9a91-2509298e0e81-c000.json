{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02517v1\", \"title\": \"MultiNeRF: Multiple Watermark Embedding for Neural Radiance Fields\", \"summary\": \"We present MultiNeRF, a 3D watermarking method that embeds multiple uniquely\\nkeyed watermarks within images rendered by a single Neural Radiance Field\\n(NeRF) model, whilst maintaining high visual quality. Our approach extends the\\nTensoRF NeRF model by incorporating a dedicated watermark grid alongside the\\nexisting geometry and appearance grids. This extension ensures higher watermark\\ncapacity without entangling watermark signals with scene content. We propose a\\nFiLM-based conditional modulation mechanism that dynamically activates\\nwatermarks based on input identifiers, allowing multiple independent watermarks\\nto be embedded and extracted without requiring model retraining. MultiNeRF is\\nvalidated on the NeRF-Synthetic and LLFF datasets, with statistically\\nsignificant improvements in robust capacity without compromising rendering\\nquality. By generalizing single-watermark NeRF methods into a flexible\\nmulti-watermarking framework, MultiNeRF provides a scalable solution for 3D\\ncontent. attribution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:06:04Z\"}"}
