In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\\npaired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in\\na coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in\\n[\\\\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.100601}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123,\\n100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical\\nanalysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then\\npropose a new model incorporating four-body interlayer interactions to realize\\nthe BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic\\ndimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal\\nphase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond\\nthe conventional phase transition theory.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:17:51Z\"}"}
