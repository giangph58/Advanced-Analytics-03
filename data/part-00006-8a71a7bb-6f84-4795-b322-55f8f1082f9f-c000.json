{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05191v1\", \"title\": \"Distributed Quantum Advantage in Locally Checkable Labeling Problems\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we present the first known example of a locally checkable\\nlabeling problem (LCL) that admits asymptotic distributed quantum advantage in\\nthe LOCAL model of distributed computing: our problem can be solved in $O(\\\\log\\nn)$ communication rounds in the quantum-LOCAL model, but it requires\\n$\\\\Omega(\\\\log n \\\\cdot \\\\log^{0.99} \\\\log n)$ communication rounds in the classical\\nrandomized-LOCAL model. We also show that distributed quantum advantage cannot\\nbe arbitrarily large: if an LCL problem can be solved in $T(n)$ rounds in the\\nquantum-LOCAL model, it can also be solved in $\\\\tilde O(\\\\sqrt{n T(n)})$ rounds\\nin the classical randomized-LOCAL model. In particular, a problem that is\\nstrictly global classically is also almost-global in quantum-LOCAL. Our second\\nresult also holds for $T(n)$-dependent probability distributions. As a\\ncorollary, if there exists a finitely dependent distribution over valid\\nlabelings of some LCL problem $\\\\Pi$, then the same problem $\\\\Pi$ can also be\\nsolved in $\\\\tilde O(\\\\sqrt{n})$ rounds in the classical randomized-LOCAL and\\ndeterministic-LOCAL models. That is, finitely dependent distributions cannot\\nexist for global LCL problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.CC,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:42:05Z\"}"}
