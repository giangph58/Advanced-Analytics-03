We claim that such a\\nformulation enables the representation of safety-aware dynamical systems,\\nsystems with bounds on disturbances, practical design limits and operational\\nboundaries, etc. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the\\nexistence of solutions to such behavioral inequalities and provide a\\nparametrization of solutions when they exist. Finally, we show the efficacy of\\nthe proposed method in two practical examples.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:43:22Z\"}"}
