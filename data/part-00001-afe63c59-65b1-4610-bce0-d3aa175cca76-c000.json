We prove that there exists a range of multiplicative\\nparameters for which every solution presents quenching, while outside this\\nrange there are both global and quenching solutions. We also characterize in\\nterms of the exponents of the absorption terms when the quenching is\\nsimultaneous or non-simultaneous and obtain the quenching rates.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:11:08Z\"}"}
