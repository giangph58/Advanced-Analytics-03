The goal of this study was to identify\\nfunctional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder\\n(AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed\\nheavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity\\n(rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN)\\nnetworks would reflect self reported recent and lifetime alcohol use,\\nlaboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics\\nrelated to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model\\n(TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized\\npartial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC)\\npatterns and their association with AUD characteristics. We observed three\\nconcurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross\\ncommunication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history\\ndensity of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii)\\nalcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings\\ndemonstrate the utility of combining theory- and data-driven approaches to\\nuncover associations between resting-state functional substrates and\\nAUD-related characteristics that could aid in the identification, development,\\nand testing of novel treatment targets across preclinical and clinical models.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.NC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:42:45Z\"}"}
