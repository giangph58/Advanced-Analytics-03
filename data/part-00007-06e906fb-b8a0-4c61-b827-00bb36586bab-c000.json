{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02734v1\", \"title\": \"Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical\\nstochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored\\nprocesses -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a\\nfixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show\\nthat these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced ``sharpening''\\nphase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak\\nmonitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a\\nclassical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known\\ncharge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show\\nthat although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are\\nin different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles\\nflow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under\\nmonitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian\\nsymmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial\\ndynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for\\nmonitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and\\nallows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of\\nsharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement\\nrecord.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.dis-nn,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:19:18Z\"}"}
