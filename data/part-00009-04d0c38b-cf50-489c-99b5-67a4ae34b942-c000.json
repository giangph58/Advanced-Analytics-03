The bifurcations are analysed\\nusing a finite-dimensional boundary map. We distinguish between two types of\\nbifurcations: topological bifurcations and boundary bifurcations. Topological\\nbifurcations describe discontinuous changes of attractors and boundary\\nbifurcations occur when singularities of an attractor's boundary are created or\\ndestroyed. We identify correspondences between topological and boundary\\nbifurcations of attractors and local and global bifurcations of the boundary\\nmap.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:17:11Z\"}"}
