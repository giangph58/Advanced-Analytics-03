{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06198v1\", \"title\": \"Critical Slowing Down in Bifurcating Stochastic Partial Differential\\n  Equations with Red Noise\", \"summary\": \"The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) has played a key role in the\\nsearch for reliable precursors of catastrophic regime shifts. This is caused by\\nits presence in a generic class of bifurcating dynamical systems. Simple\\ntime-series statistics such as variance or autocorrelation can be taken as\\nproxies for the phenomenon, making their increase a useful early warning signal\\n(EWS) for catastrophic regime shifts. However, the modelling basis justifying\\nthe use of these EWSs is usually a finite-dimensional stochastic ordinary\\ndifferential equation, where a mathematical proof for the aptness is possible.\\nOnly recently has the phenomenon of CSD been proven to exist in\\ninfinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), which\\nare more appropriate to model real-world spatial systems. In this context, we\\nprovide an essential extension of the results for SPDEs under a specific noise\\nforcing, often referred to as red noise. This type of time-correlated noise is\\nomnipresent in many physical systems, such as climate and ecology. We approach\\nthe question with a mathematical proof and a numerical analysis for the\\nlinearised problem. We find that also under red noise forcing, the aptness of\\nEWSs persists, supporting their employment in a wide range of applications.\\nHowever, we also find that false or muted warnings are possible if the noise\\ncorrelations are non-stationary. We thereby extend a previously known\\ncomplication with respect to red noise and EWSs from finite-dimensional\\ndynamics to the more complex and realistic setting of SPDEs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR,math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:41:34Z\"}"}
