This article\\nattempts to predict the structure of the zero-divisor graph of the ring of\\nGaussian integers modulo $2$ to the power $n$ and determine the size, chromatic\\nnumber, clique number, independence number, and matching through associate\\nclasses of divisors of $2^n$ in $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2^n}[i]$. In addition, a few\\ntopological indices of the corresponding zero-divisor graph, are obtained.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AC\", \"categories\": \"math.AC,math.CO,math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:15:59Z\"}"}
