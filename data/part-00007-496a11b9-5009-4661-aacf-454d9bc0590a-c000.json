In\\nground-based spectroscopy, it can be difficult to distinguish the sharp LAE\\npeak from residual sky emission lines using automated methods, leading to\\nmisclassified redshifts. We present a Bayesian spectral component separation\\ntechnique to automatically determine spectroscopic redshifts for LAEs while\\nmarginalizing over sky residuals. We use visually inspected spectra of LAEs\\nobtained using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to create a\\ndata-driven prior and can determine redshift by jointly inferring sky residual,\\nLAE, and residual components for each individual spectrum. We demonstrate this\\nmethod on 910 spectroscopically observed $z = 2-4$ DESI LAE candidate spectra\\nand determine their redshifts with $>$90% accuracy when validated against\\nvisually inspected redshifts. Using the $\\\\Delta \\\\chi^2$ value from our pipeline\\nas a proxy for detection confidence, we then explore potential survey design\\nchoices and implications for targeting LAEs with medium-band photometry. This\\nmethod allows for scalability and accuracy in determining redshifts from DESI\\nspectra, and the results provide recommendations for LAE targeting in\\nanticipation of future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.CO,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:21:20Z\"}"}
