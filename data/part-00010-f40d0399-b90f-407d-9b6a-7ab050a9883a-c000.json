In this paper we obtain a comparison result for\\nthe $p$-Laplace operator in multiply connected domains with Robin boundary\\ncondition on the exterior boundary and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary\\nconditions on the interior one, generalizing the results obtained in \\\\cite{ANT,\\nAGM} to this type of domains. This will be a generalization to Robin boundary\\ncondition of the results obtained in \\\\cite{B, B2}, with an improvement of the\\n$L^2$ comparison in the case $p=2$. As a consequence, we obtain a Bossel-Daners\\nand Saint-Venant type inequalities for multiply connected domains.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:47:15Z\"}"}
