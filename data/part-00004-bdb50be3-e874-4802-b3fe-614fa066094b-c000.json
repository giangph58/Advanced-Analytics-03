{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07943v1\", \"title\": \"HoloPart: Generative 3D Part Amodal Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"3D part amodal segmentation--decomposing a 3D shape into complete,\\nsemantically meaningful parts, even when occluded--is a challenging but crucial\\ntask for 3D content creation and understanding. Existing 3D part segmentation\\nmethods only identify visible surface patches, limiting their utility. Inspired\\nby 2D amodal segmentation, we introduce this novel task to the 3D domain and\\npropose a practical, two-stage approach, addressing the key challenges of\\ninferring occluded 3D geometry, maintaining global shape consistency, and\\nhandling diverse shapes with limited training data. First, we leverage existing\\n3D part segmentation to obtain initial, incomplete part segments. Second, we\\nintroduce HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model, to complete these segments\\ninto full 3D parts. HoloPart utilizes a specialized architecture with local\\nattention to capture fine-grained part geometry and global shape context\\nattention to ensure overall shape consistency. We introduce new benchmarks\\nbased on the ABO and PartObjaverse-Tiny datasets and demonstrate that HoloPart\\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art shape completion methods. By\\nincorporating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, we achieve\\npromising results on 3D part amodal segmentation, opening new avenues for\\napplications in geometry editing, animation, and material assignment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:53:31Z\"}"}
