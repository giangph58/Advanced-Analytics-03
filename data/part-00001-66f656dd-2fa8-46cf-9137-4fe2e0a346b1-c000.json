Our model is posed for several\\nfractional derivative operators. We have conducted a comprehensive foundation\\nanalysis of this model for the different fractional derivatives. Additionally,\\nwe have incorporated a strength parameter that shows the combined impact of\\nnonlinear and linear components within an epidemiological model. We have used\\nthe second derivative of the Lyapunov function to ascertain the detection of\\nwave patterns within the vaccination dynamics.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:04:17Z\"}"}
