A\\nbranching fraction of $(1.08 \\\\pm 0.17) \\\\times 10^{-8}$ is measured, where the\\nuncertainty includes statistical and systematic sources. No evidence of\\nresonant structures is found in the dimuon invariant-mass distribution. All\\nresults are compatible with Standard Model expectations. This represents the\\nrarest decay of a baryon ever observed.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:37:03Z\"}"}
