The field we imaged with 14\\\" (0.6 pc)\\nspatial and 1 km/s spectral resolution contains the Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND)\\naround the central black hole Sgr A*, the neighboring thermal Arched Filaments,\\nthe nonthermal filaments of the Radio Arc, and the three luminous central star\\nclusters. [C II] traces emission from the CND's inner edge to material orbiting\\nat a distance of approximately 6 pc. Its velocity field reveals no sign of\\ninflowing material nor interaction with winds from the Sgr A East supernova\\nremnant. Wide-field imaging of the Sgr A region shows multiple circular\\nsegments, including the thermal Arched Filaments, that are centered on a region\\nthat includes the Quintuplet cluster. We examine the possibility that the\\nArched Filaments and other large-scale arcs trace transient excitation events\\nfrom supernova blast waves. Along the Arched Filaments, comparisons among\\nfar-IR fine structure lines show changes in ionization state over small scales\\nand that high-excitation lines are systematically shifted in position from the\\nother lines. These also point to transient fast winds that shocked on the\\nsurface of the Arches cloud to produce additional local UV radiation to excite\\nthe Arched Filaments on a cloud surface illuminated by UV from hot stars.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:18:59Z\"}"}
