Being able to efficiently implement quantum algorithms\\ninvolving entangling gates and asses their output is mandatory for quantum\\nutility. In a transmon-based 5-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we\\ncompared the performance of quantum circuits involving an increasing level of\\ncomplexity, from single-qubit circuits to maximally entangled Bell circuits.\\nThis comparison highlighted the importance of the readout analysis and helped\\nus optimize the protocol for more advanced quantum algorithms. Here we report\\nthe results obtained from the analysis of the outputs of quantum circuits using\\ntwo readout paradigms, referred to as \\\"multiplied readout probabilities\\\" and\\n\\\"conditional readout probabilities\\\". The first method is suitable for\\nsingle-qubit circuits, while the second is essential for accurately\\ninterpreting the outputs of circuits involving two-qubit gates.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:20:56Z\"}"}
