This post-PPv (pppv) silicate is proposed as\\nthe primary mantle silicate in these massive rocky exoplanets. Understanding\\nthe fundamental properties of pppv, particularly in solid solutions with\\nFe2SiO4, is crucial for insights into the interior dynamics and compositions of\\nsuch planets. In this study, we conduct an ab initio investigation of the\\nproperties of Fe2+-bearing pppv at pressures ranging from 400 GPa to 1 TPa.\\nGiven the localized nature of 3d-electrons in iron, we employ the LDA+Usc\\nmethod alongside conventional DFT functionals to probe the electronic structure\\nof this system. The dependence of the Hubbard parameter U on volume and spin\\nstate is carefully evaluated. Furthermore, we systematically explore the\\neffects of pressure, temperature, and structural variations on the spin state\\nof iron in Fe2+-bearing pppv, providing valuable data to improve mantle\\nmodeling for super-Earth-type exoplanets.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:32:32Z\"}"}
