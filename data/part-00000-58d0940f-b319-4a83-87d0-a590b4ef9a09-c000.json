{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06786v1\", \"title\": \"Axion production from electron-nucleon scattering in chiral effective\\n  theory\", \"summary\": \"In this work we study the axion production from the electron-nucleon\\nscattering, i.e., the $eN\\\\to e N a$ processes, being $N$ the proton and\\nneutron. We simultaneously include three different types of axion interaction\\ncouplings within the chiral effective field theory, namely the\\naxion-nucleon-nucleon couplings $g_{aNN}$, axion-photon-photon coupling\\n$g_{a\\\\gamma\\\\gamma}$ and axion-photon-vector meson resonances couplings $g_{\\\\rho\\na\\\\gamma}$ and $g_{\\\\omega a\\\\gamma}$. Vast inputs from the lattice QCD and hadron\\nphenomenological studies are used to fix the unknown couplings. The relative\\nstrengths of different axion interactions in the $eN\\\\to e N a$ processes are\\nthen revealed. We provide detailed predictions for the differential cross\\nsections with respect to various angles and axion energy, as well as the total\\ncross sections, both for the Kim-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov (KSVZ) and\\nDine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axion models.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:19:20Z\"}"}
