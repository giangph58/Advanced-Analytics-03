{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02475v1\", \"title\": \"Heat Conduction with Phase Change in Permafrost Modules of Vegetation\\n  Models\", \"summary\": \"We consider the problem of heat conduction with phase change, that is\\nessential for permafrost modeling in Land Surface Models and Dynamic Global\\nVegetation Models. These models require minimal computational effort and an\\nextremely robust solver for large-scale, long-term simulations. The weak\\nenthalpy formulation of the Stefan problem is used as the mathematical model\\nand a finite element method is employed for the discretization. Leveraging the\\npiecewise affine structure of the nonlinear time-stepping equation system, we\\ndemonstrate that this system has a unique solution and provide a solver that is\\nguaranteed to find this solution in a finite number of steps from any initial\\nguess. Comparisons with the Neumann analytical solution and tests in the\\nLund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land vegetation model reveal that the new method does\\nnot introduce significantly higher computational costs than the widely used\\nDECP method while providing greater accuracy. In particular, it avoids a known\\nnonphysical artifact in the solution.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:52:35Z\"}"}
