{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06631v1\", \"title\": \"The Method for Storing Patterns in Neural Networks-Memorization and\\n  Recall of QR code Patterns-\", \"summary\": \"In this paper, we propose a mechanism for storing complex patterns within a\\nneural network and subsequently recalling them. This model is based on our work\\npublished in 2018(Inazawa, 2018), which we have refined and extended in this\\nwork. With the recent advancements in deep learning and large language model\\n(LLM)-based AI technologies (generative AI), it can be considered that\\nmethodologies for the learning are becoming increasingly well-established. In\\nthe future, we expect to see further research on memory using models based on\\nTransformers (Vaswani, et. al., 2017, Rae, et. al., 2020), but in this paper we\\npropose a simpler and more powerful model of memory and recall in neural\\nnetworks. The advantage of storing patterns in a neural network lies in its\\nability to recall the original pattern even when an incomplete version is\\npresented. The patterns we have produced for use in this study have been QR\\ncode (DENSO WAVE, 1994), which has become widely used as an information\\ntransmission tool in recent years.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NE\", \"categories\": \"cs.NE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:09:40Z\"}"}
