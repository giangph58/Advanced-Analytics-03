{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06242v1\", \"title\": \"Addressing Relative Degree Issues in Control Barrier Function Synthesis\\n  with Physics-Informed Neural Networks\", \"summary\": \"In robotics, control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filters are commonly\\nused to enforce state constraints. A critical challenge arises when the\\nrelative degree of the CBF varies across the state space. This variability can\\ncreate regions within the safe set where the control input becomes\\nunconstrained. When implemented as a safety filter, this may result in\\nchattering near the safety boundary and ultimately compromise system safety. To\\naddress this issue, we propose a novel approach for CBF synthesis by\\nformulating it as solving a set of boundary value problems. The solutions to\\nthe boundary value problems are determined using physics-informed neural\\nnetworks (PINNs). Our approach ensures that the synthesized CBFs maintain a\\nconstant relative degree across the set of admissible states, thereby\\npreventing unconstrained control scenarios. We illustrate the approach in\\nsimulation and further verify it through real-world quadrotor experiments,\\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in preserving desired system safety properties.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.RO,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:41:43Z\"}"}
