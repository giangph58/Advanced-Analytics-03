Yet, the\\nexact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general\\ngraphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman\\ngenerator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of\\ndistinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase\\nlags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. This reveals a broad class of\\nnetwork motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie\\nsymmetries that generate new constants of motion. Our results provide a\\nrigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics\\non complex networks.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.AO\", \"categories\": \"nlin.AO,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:53:08Z\"}"}
