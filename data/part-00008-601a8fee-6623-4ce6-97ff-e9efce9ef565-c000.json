Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer\\nonly indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many\\ndetections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity\\nexists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave\\nsignature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an\\ninterface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an\\nequation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show\\nthat such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers\\nand possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:22:36Z\"}"}
