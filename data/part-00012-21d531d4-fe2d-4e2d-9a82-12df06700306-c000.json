An analog\\nof this in the quantum situation is highly desirable but has not been found\\nyet. In this paper, we present a general method for the construction of\\npartially compactified quantum cluster algebra structures on quantized\\ncoordinate rings from that of quantum cluster algebra structures on\\nlocalizations. As an application, we construct a partially compactified quantum\\ncluster algebra structure on the quantized coordinate ring of every connected,\\nsimply connected complex simple algebraic group. Along the way, we also prove\\nthat the Berenstein--Zelevinsky seeds on a quantum double Bruhat cell\\nassociated to arbitrary unshuffled signed words can be obtained from each other\\nby successive mutations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.QA\", \"categories\": \"math.QA,math.RA,math.RT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:38:54Z\"}"}
