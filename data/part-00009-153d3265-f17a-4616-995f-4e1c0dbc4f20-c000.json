Therefore, a more flexible approach\\nis to have these biases emerge naturally from the algorithm. We introduce Free\\nRandom Projection, an input mapping grounded in free probability theory that\\nconstructs random orthogonal matrices where hierarchical structure arises\\ninherently. The free random projection integrates seamlessly into existing\\nin-context reinforcement learning frameworks by encoding hierarchical\\norganization within the input space without requiring explicit architectural\\nmodifications. Empirical results on multi-environment benchmarks show that free\\nrandom projection consistently outperforms the standard random projection,\\nleading to improvements in generalization. Furthermore, analyses within\\nlinearly solvable Markov decision processes and investigations of the spectrum\\nof kernel random matrices reveal the theoretical underpinnings of free random\\nprojection's enhanced performance, highlighting its capacity for effective\\nadaptation in hierarchically structured state spaces.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,math.PR,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:38:50Z\"}"}
