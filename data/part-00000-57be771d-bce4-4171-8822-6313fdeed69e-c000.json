Maturity Ratings Affect Fanfiction Style\\n  and Community Engagement\", \"summary\": \"We consider the textual profiles of different fanfiction maturity ratings,\\nhow they vary across fan groups, and how this relates to reader engagement\\nmetrics. Previous studies have shown that fanfiction writing is motivated by a\\ncombination of admiration for and frustration with the fan object. These\\nfindings emerge when looking at fanfiction as a whole, as well as when it is\\ndivided into subgroups, also called fandoms. However, maturity ratings are used\\nto indicate the intended audience of the fanfiction, as well as whether the\\nstory includes mature themes and explicit scenes. Since these ratings can be\\nused to filter readers and writers, they can also be seen as a proxy for\\ndifferent reader/writer motivations and desires. We find that explicit\\nfanfiction in particular has a distinct textual profile when compared to other\\nmaturity ratings. These findings thus nuance our understanding of reader/writer\\nmotivations in fanfiction communities, and also highlights the influence of the\\ncommunity norms and fan behavior more generally on these cultural products.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:20:59Z\"}"}
