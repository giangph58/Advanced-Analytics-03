These results are then used to derive robust\\nversions of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) in large financial\\nmarkets in discrete time, characterizing the absence of arbitrage under\\nKnightian uncertainty. To this end, we consider robust formulations of no\\nasymptotic arbitrage of first kind (NAA1), which is the large market analogue\\nof ``No unbounded profit with bounded risk'' (NUPBR), as well as no asymptotic\\narbitrage of second kind (NAA2). We illustrate our theoretical results with an\\nexample of a sequence of robust binomial models converging to a robust\\nBlack-Scholes model.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:46:05Z\"}"}
