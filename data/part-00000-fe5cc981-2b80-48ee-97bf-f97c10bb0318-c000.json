Many existing\\nmodels do not fully capture the complex, multiscale interactions among neuronal\\nactivity, astrocytic signaling, and vascular dynamics--especially in key\\nbrainstem regions. In this work, we present a 3D-1D-0D multiscale computational\\nframework for modeling the neuro-glial-vascular unit (NGVU) in the dorsal vagal\\ncomplex (DVC). Our approach integrates a quadripartite synapse model--which\\nrepresents the interplay among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes,\\nand vascular smooth muscle cells--with a hierarchical description of vascular\\ndynamics that couples a three-dimensional microcirculatory network with a\\none-dimensional macrocirculatory representation and a zero-dimensional synaptic\\ncomponent. By linking neuronal spiking, astrocytic calcium and gliotransmitter\\nsignaling, and vascular tone regulation, our model reproduces key features of\\nfunctional hyperemia and elucidates the feedback loops that help maintain\\ncerebral blood flow. Simulation results demonstrate that neurotransmitter\\nrelease triggers astrocytic responses that modulate vessel radius to optimize\\noxygen and nutrient delivery. This integrated framework, to our knowledge the\\nfirst model to combine these elements for the NGVU in the DVC, provides a\\nrobust and modular platform for future investigations into the pathophysiology\\nof cerebral blood flow regulation and its role in autonomic control, including\\nthe regulation of stomach function.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.TO\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.TO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:42:18Z\"}"}
