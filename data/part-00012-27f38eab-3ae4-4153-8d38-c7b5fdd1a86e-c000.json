In this paper we explore a new design for, and implementation of, GC\\nin Rust, called Alloy. Unlike previous approaches to GC in Rust, Alloy maps\\nexisting Rust destructors to finalizers: this makes GC in Rust natural to use\\nbut introduces surprising soundness, performance, and ergonomic problems.
