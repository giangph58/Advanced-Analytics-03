{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02248v1\", \"title\": \"CRC-SGAD: Conformal Risk Control for Supervised Graph Anomaly Detection\", \"summary\": \"Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is critical in security-sensitive domains, yet\\nfaces reliability challenges: miscalibrated confidence estimation\\n(underconfidence in normal nodes, overconfidence in anomalies), adversarial\\nvulnerability of derived confidence score under structural perturbations, and\\nlimited efficacy of conventional calibration methods for sparse anomaly\\npatterns. Thus we propose CRC-SGAD, a framework integrating statistical risk\\ncontrol into GAD via two innovations: (1) A Dual-Threshold Conformal Risk\\nControl mechanism that provides theoretically guaranteed bounds for both False\\nNegative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) through providing prediction\\nsets; (2) A Subgraph-aware Spectral Graph Neural Calibrator (SSGNC) that\\noptimizes node representations through adaptive spectral filtering while\\nreducing the size of prediction sets via hybrid loss optimization. Experiments\\non four datasets and five GAD models demonstrate statistically significant\\nimprovements in FNR and FPR control and prediction set size. CRC-SGAD\\nestablishes a paradigm for statistically rigorous anomaly detection in\\ngraph-structured security applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:27:49Z\"}"}
