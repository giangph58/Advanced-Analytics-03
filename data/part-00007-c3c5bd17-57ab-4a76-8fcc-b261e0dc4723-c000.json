This inference is mainly due to our ability to predict and successfully\\nmonitor certain quasi-periodic doubly peaked high brightness flares with a\\nperiod of $\\\\sim$12 years from this blazer. The use of post-Newtonian accurate\\nSMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW\\nemission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the\\nepochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares in our SMBH binary central engine\\ndescription for OJ~287. It was very recently argued that one should include the\\neffects of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes\\naround the primary SMBH, to explain the {\\\\it observed} decay of SMBH binary\\norbit in OJ~287. Invoking binary pulsar timing-based arguments, measurements,\\nand OJ~287's orbital description, we show that observationally relevant SMBH\\nbinary orbital dynamics in OJ~287 are insensitive to dark matter-induced\\ndynamical friction effects. This implies that we could only provide an upper\\nbound on the spike index parameter rather than obtaining an observationally\\nderived value, as argued by \\\\cite{Chan2024}.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.GA,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:26:50Z\"}"}
