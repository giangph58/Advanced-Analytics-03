{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07032v1\", \"title\": \"Restoring the Forecasting Power of Google Trends with Statistical\\n  Preprocessing\", \"summary\": \"Google Trends reports how frequently specific queries are searched on Google\\nover time. It is widely used in research and industry to gain early insights\\ninto public interest. However, its data generation mechanism introduces missing\\nvalues, sampling variability, noise, and trends. These issues arise from\\nprivacy thresholds mapping low search volumes to zeros, daily sampling\\nvariations causing discrepancies across historical downloads, and algorithm\\nupdates altering volume magnitudes over time. Data quality has recently\\ndeteriorated, with more zeros and noise, even for previously stable queries. We\\npropose a comprehensive statistical methodology to preprocess Google Trends\\nsearch information using hierarchical clustering, smoothing splines, and\\ndetrending. We validate our approach by forecasting U.S. influenza\\nhospitalizations with a univariate ARIMAX model. Compared to omitting exogenous\\nvariables, our results show that raw Google Trends data degrades modeling\\nperformance, while preprocessed signals enhance forecast accuracy by 58%\\nnationally and 24% at the state level.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:45:58Z\"}"}
