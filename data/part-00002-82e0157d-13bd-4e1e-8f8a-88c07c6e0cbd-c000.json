However, existing marine segmentation\\ntechniques face the dilemma of object mislocalization and imprecise boundaries\\ndue to the complex underwater environment. Meanwhile, despite the impressive\\nperformance of diffusion models in visual segmentation, there remains potential\\nto further leverage contextual semantics to enhance feature learning of\\nregion-level salient objects, thereby improving segmentation outcomes. Building\\non this insight, we propose DiffMSS, a novel marine saliency segmenter based on\\nthe diffusion model, which utilizes semantic knowledge distillation to guide\\nthe segmentation of marine salient objects. Specifically, we design a\\nregion-word similarity matching mechanism to identify salient terms at the word\\nlevel from the text descriptions. These high-level semantic features guide the\\nconditional feature learning network in generating salient and accurate\\ndiffusion conditions with semantic knowledge distillation. To further refine\\nthe segmentation of fine-grained structures in unique marine organisms, we\\ndevelop the dedicated consensus deterministic sampling to suppress\\noverconfident missegmentations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the\\nsuperior performance of DiffMSS over state-of-the-art methods in both\\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:31:36Z\"}"}
