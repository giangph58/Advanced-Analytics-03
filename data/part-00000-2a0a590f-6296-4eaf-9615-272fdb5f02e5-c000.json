{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23706v1\", \"title\": \"Simultaneously generating Brillouin microlaser and second harmonic\\n  within a lithium niobate microdisk\", \"summary\": \"We report the simultaneous generation of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and\\nBrillouin microlaser in a high-quality thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN)\\nmicrodisk resonator. The microdisk is fabricated with ultrahigh-Q factor of\\n4X10(6) by photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching, enabling\\nsignificant cavity-enhancement effect for boosting nonlinear frequency\\nconversion. Under 1559.632 nm pumping, Brillouin microlaser is demonstrated in\\nthe microdisk with Stokes Brillouin shift of 10 GHz, a low threshold of 1.81\\nmW, and a fundamental linewidth of 254.365 Hz. Meanwhile, efficient SHG is\\nobserved at 779.816 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 3.8% at pump\\nlevel of 3.028 mW. The coexistence of these two nonlinear processes is enabled\\nby the simultaneous confinement of the light and acoustic fileds for effect\\ncoupling in the microdisk, which enhances both optomechanical and second-order\\nnonlinear interactions. This research provides new possibilities for integrated\\nmulti-frequency laser sources and multifunctional nonlinear photonic devices.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:02:13Z\"}"}
