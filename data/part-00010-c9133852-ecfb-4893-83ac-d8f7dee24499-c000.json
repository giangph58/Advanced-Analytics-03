This can be\\nchallenging for fibre-coupled receivers, due to the time variant inhomogeneity\\nof the refractive index that can cause strong fluctuations in the power coupled\\ninto the Single-Mode Fiber (SMF), and requires the use of Adaptive Optics (AO)\\nsystems to correct the atmospheric induced aberrations. In this work, we\\npresent two adaptive optic systems, one using a Fast-Steering Prism (FSP) for\\nthe correction of tip-tilt and a second one based on a Multi-Actuator\\ndeformable Lens (MAL), capable of correcting up to the third order of Zernike's\\npolynomials. We test both systems at telecom wavelength both with artificial\\nturbulence in the laboratory and on a free-space channel, demonstrating their\\neffectiveness in increasing the fibre coupling efficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T15:21:58Z\"}"}
