{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06090v1\", \"title\": \"Low-Complexity SDP-ADMM for Physical-Layer Multicasting in Massive MIMO\\n  Systems\", \"summary\": \"There is a demand for the same data content from several user equipments\\n(UEs) in many wireless communication applications. Physical-layer multicasting\\ncombines the beamforming capability of massive MIMO (multiple-input\\nmultiple-output) and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to\\nefficiently deliver the same data to a group of UEs using a single\\ntransmission. This paper tackles the max-min fair (MMF) multicast beamforming\\noptimization, which is an NP-hard problem. We develop an efficient semidefinite\\nprogram-alternating direction method of multipliers (SDP-ADMM) algorithm to\\nfind the near-global optimal rank-1 solution to the MMF multicast problem in a\\nmassive MIMO system. Numerical results show that the proposed SDP-ADMM\\nalgorithm exhibits similar spectral efficiency performance to state-of-the-art\\nalgorithms running on standard SDP solvers at a vastly reduced computational\\ncomplexity. We highlight that the proposed ADMM elimination procedure can be\\nemployed as an effective low-complexity rank reduction method for other\\nproblems utilizing semidefinite relaxation.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:30:44Z\"}"}
