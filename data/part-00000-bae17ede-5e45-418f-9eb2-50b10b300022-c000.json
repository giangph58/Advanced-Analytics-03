Yet, its complex\\ncomponents, gathering data cross-chip from many parts of the core, raise\\nquestions of how to build it into commodity cores without heavy design invasion\\nand extensive re-engineering.\\n  We build the first full-RTL design, MEEK, into an open-source SoC, from\\nmicroarchitecture and ISA to the OS and programming model. We identify and\\nsolve bottlenecks and bugs overlooked in previous work, and demonstrate that\\nMEEK offers microsecond-level detection capacity with affordable overheads. By\\ntrading off architectural functionalities across codesigned hardware-software\\nlayers, MEEK features only light changes to a mature out-of-order superscalar\\ncore, simple coordinating software layers, and a few lines of operating-system\\ncode.
