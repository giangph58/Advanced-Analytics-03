{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23820v1\", \"title\": \"When Counterfactual Reasoning Fails: Chaos and Real-World Complexity\", \"summary\": \"Counterfactual reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition and\\ndecision-making, is often seen as the 'holy grail' of causal learning, with\\napplications ranging from interpreting machine learning models to promoting\\nalgorithmic fairness. While counterfactual reasoning has been extensively\\nstudied in contexts where the underlying causal model is well-defined,\\nreal-world causal modeling is often hindered by model and parameter\\nuncertainty, observational noise, and chaotic behavior. The reliability of\\ncounterfactual analysis in such settings remains largely unexplored. In this\\nwork, we investigate the limitations of counterfactual reasoning within the\\nframework of Structural Causal Models. Specifically, we empirically investigate\\n\\\\emph{counterfactual sequence estimation} and highlight cases where it becomes\\nincreasingly unreliable. We find that realistic assumptions, such as low\\ndegrees of model uncertainty or chaotic dynamics, can result in\\ncounterintuitive outcomes, including dramatic deviations between predicted and\\ntrue counterfactual trajectories. This work urges caution when applying\\ncounterfactual reasoning in settings characterized by chaos and uncertainty.\\nFurthermore, it raises the question of whether certain systems may pose\\nfundamental limitations on the ability to answer counterfactual questions about\\ntheir behavior.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:14:51Z\"}"}
