{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05128v1\", \"title\": \"Kinetic study of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability with\\n  time-varying acceleration\", \"summary\": \"Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability commonly arises in compressible systems with\\ntime-dependent acceleration in practical applications. To capture the complex\\ndynamics of such systems, a two-component discrete Boltzmann method is\\ndeveloped to systematically investigate the compressible RT instability driven\\nby variable acceleration. Specifically, the effects of different acceleration\\nperiods, amplitudes, and phases are systematically analyzed. The simulation\\nresults are interpreted from three key perspectives: the density gradient,\\nwhich characterizes the spatial variation in density; the thermodynamic\\nnon-equilibrium strength, which quantifies the system's deviation from local\\nthermodynamic equilibrium; and the fraction of non-equilibrium regions, which\\ncaptures the spatial distribution of non-equilibrium behaviors. Notably, the\\nfluid system exhibits rich and diverse dynamic patterns resulting from the\\ninterplay of multiple competing physical mechanisms, including time-dependent\\nacceleration, RT instability, diffusion, and dissipation effects. These\\nfindings provide deeper insights into the evolution and regulation of\\ncompressible RT instability under complex driving conditions.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:32:33Z\"}"}
