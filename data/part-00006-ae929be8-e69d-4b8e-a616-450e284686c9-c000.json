{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24013v1\", \"title\": \"You Cannot Feed Two Birds with One Score: the Accuracy-Naturalness\\n  Tradeoff in Translation\", \"summary\": \"The goal of translation, be it by human or by machine, is, given some text in\\na source language, to produce text in a target language that simultaneously 1)\\npreserves the meaning of the source text and 2) achieves natural expression in\\nthe target language. However, researchers in the machine translation community\\nusually assess translations using a single score intended to capture semantic\\naccuracy and the naturalness of the output simultaneously. In this paper, we\\nbuild on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and\\nempirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries do not and cannot give\\nthe complete picture of a system's true performance. Concretely, we prove that\\na tradeoff exists between accuracy and naturalness and demonstrate it by\\nevaluating the submissions to the WMT24 shared task. Our findings help explain\\nwell-known empirical phenomena, such as the observation that optimizing\\ntranslation systems for a specific accuracy metric (like BLEU) initially\\nimproves the system's naturalness, while ``overfitting'' the system to the\\nmetric can significantly degrade its naturalness. Thus, we advocate for a\\nchange in how translations are evaluated: rather than comparing systems using a\\nsingle number, they should be compared on an accuracy-naturalness plane.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:39:51Z\"}"}
