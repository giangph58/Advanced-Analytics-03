{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23986v1\", \"title\": \"A Practical Rollup Escape Hatch Design\", \"summary\": \"A rollup network is a type of popular \\\"Layer 2\\\" scaling solution for general\\npurpose \\\"Layer 1\\\" blockchains like Ethereum. Rollups networks separate\\nexecution of transactions from other aspects like consensus, processing\\ntransactions off of the Layer 1, and posting the data onto the underlying layer\\nfor security. While rollups offer significant scalability advantages, they\\noften rely on centralized operators for transaction ordering and inclusion,\\nwhich also introduces potential risks. If the operator fails to build rollup\\nblocks or propose new state roots to the underlying Layer 1, users may lose\\naccess to digital assets on the rollup. An escape hatch allows users to bypass\\nthe failing operator and withdraw assets directly on the Layer 1. We propose\\nusing a time-based trigger, Merkle proofs, and new resolver contracts to\\nimplement a practical escape hatch for these networks. The use of novel\\nresolver contracts allow user owned assets to be located in the Layer 2 state\\nroot, including those owned by smart contracts, in order to allow users to\\nescape them. This design ensures safe and verifiable escape of assets,\\nincluding ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, and more, from the Layer 2.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T11:55:10Z\"}"}
