As a first validation they proved the conjecture for\\nquasilinear Schr\\\\\\\"odinger flows.\\n  In the present article we expand the reach of these ideas and methods to the\\ncase of quasilinear ultrahyperbolic Schr\\\\\\\"odinger flows, which is the first\\nexample with a nonconvex dispersion relation.\\n  The study of local well-posedness for this class of problems, in all\\ndimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized\\ninitial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru (MMT) and\\nPineau-Taylor (PT) for initial data in Sobolev spaces in the elliptic and\\nnon-elliptic cases, respectively.\\n  Our results here mirror the earlier results in the elliptic case: (i) a new,\\npotentially sharp local well-posedness result in low regularity Sobolev spaces,\\none derivative below MMT and just one-half derivative above scaling, (ii) a\\nsmall data global well-posedness and scattering result at the same regularity\\nlevel. One key novelty in this setting is the introduction of a new family of\\ninteraction Morawetz functionals which are suitable for obtaining bilinear\\nestimates in the ultrahyperbolic setting. We remark that this method appears to\\nbe robust enough to potentially be of use in a large data regime when the\\nmetric is not a small perturbation of a Euclidean one.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:24:40Z\"}"}
