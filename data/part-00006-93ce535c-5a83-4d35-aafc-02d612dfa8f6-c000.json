{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02673v1\", \"title\": \"QUITS: A modular Qldpc code circUIT Simulator\", \"summary\": \"To achieve quantum fault tolerance with lower overhead, quantum low-density\\nparity-check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising alternative to\\ntopological codes such as the surface code, offering higher code rates. To\\nsupport their study, an end-to-end framework for simulating QLDPC codes at the\\ncircuit level is needed. In this work, we present QUITS, a modular and flexible\\ncircuit-level simulator for QLDPC codes. Its design allows users to freely\\ncombine LDPC code constructions, syndrome extraction circuits, decoding\\nalgorithms, and noise models, enabling comprehensive and customizable studies\\nof the performance of QLDPC codes under circuit-level noise. QUITS supports\\nseveral leading QLDPC families, including hypergraph product codes, lifted\\nproduct codes, and balanced product codes. As part of the framework, we\\nintroduce a syndrome extraction circuit improved from Tremblay, Delfosse, and\\nBeverland [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 050504 (2022)] that applies to all three code\\nfamilies. In particular, for a small hypergraph product code, our circuit\\nachieves lower depth than the conventional method, resulting in improved\\nlogical performance. Using \\\\QUITS, we evaluate the performance of\\nstate-of-the-art QLDPC codes and decoders under various settings, revealing\\ntrade-offs between the decoding runtime and the logical failure rate. The\\nsource code of QUITS is available online.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:14:13Z\"}"}
