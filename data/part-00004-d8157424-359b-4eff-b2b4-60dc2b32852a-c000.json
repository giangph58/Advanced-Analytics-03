{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02608v1\", \"title\": \"Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics: Strong-Field\\n  Quantum Electrodynamics\", \"summary\": \"This document sets out the intention of the strong-field QED community to\\ncarry out, both experimentally and numerically, high-statistics parametric\\nstudies of quantum electrodynamics in the non-perturbative regime, at fields\\napproaching and exceeding the critical or `Schwinger' field of QED. In this\\nregime, several exotic and fascinating phenomena are predicted to occur that\\nhave never been directly observed in the laboratory. These include\\nBreit-Wheeler pair production, vacuum birefringence, and quantum radiation\\nreaction. This experimental program will also serve as a stepping stone towards\\nstudies of elusive phenomena such as elastic scattering of real photons and the\\nconjectured perturbative breakdown of QED at extreme fields. State-of-the-art\\nhigh-power laser facilities in Europe and beyond are starting to offer unique\\nopportunities to study this uncharted regime at the intensity frontier, which\\nis highly relevant also for the design of future multi-TeV lepton colliders.\\nHowever, a transition from qualitative observational experiments to\\nquantitative and high-statistics measurements can only be performed with\\nlarge-scale collaborations and with systematic experimental programs devoted to\\nthe optimisation of several aspects of these complex experiments, including\\ndetector developments, stability and tolerances studies, and laser technology.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T14:10:23Z\"}"}
