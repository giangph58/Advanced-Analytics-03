The synthesis algorithm reduces to designing sorting\\nnetworks with nearest neighbor swapping operations as elementary gates. We\\nrecover previous designs from the literature but with additional theoretical\\nproperties regarding the compiler that implements unitaries on the\\ninterferometer. Notably the compiler can always decide whether a unitary can be\\nimplemented on a given interferometer and, if so, returns the shallowest\\npossible implementation. We also show natural extensions of our framework for\\nboson sampling experiments and for the coupling of multiple integrated\\ninterferometers to design larger linear optical systems. In both cases, the\\ndesigns are optimal in terms of number of optical components. Finally, we\\npropose a greedy design which exploits the arbritrary-but-fixed coupling of\\nseparate integrated interferometers to perform shallow boson sampling. We\\ndiscuss the optimal interferometer dimensions to maximize the transmission.\\nBeyond boson sampling, our developed framework allows a resource-favourable\\nimplemention of any non-adaptive linear optical quantum algorithm, by providing\\nthe shallowest possible interferometer for implementing this algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:03:04Z\"}"}
