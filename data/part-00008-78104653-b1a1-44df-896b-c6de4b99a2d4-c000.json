To address this issue, we establish principles for\\ncombining multiple programming languages operating on different atomic types\\nusing a symbolic execution semantics. This facilitates the (parallel)\\ncomposition of labeled transition systems, improving the analysis of complex\\nsystems by streamlining communication between diverse programming languages. By\\ntreating the Dolev-Yao (DY) model as a symbolic abstraction, our approach\\neliminates the need for translation between different base types, such as\\nbitstrings and DY terms. Our technique provides a foundation for securing\\ninteractions in multi-language environments, enhancing program verification and\\nsystem analysis in complex, interconnected systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:50:03Z\"}"}
