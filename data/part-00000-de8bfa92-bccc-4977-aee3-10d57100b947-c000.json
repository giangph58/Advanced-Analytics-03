The relative yields and flux-averaged cross-sections of multinucleon\\nphotonuclear reactions with the emission of up to 9 neutrons in 181Ta nuclei\\nwere determined. Monte Carlo simulations to study the yields of photonuclear\\nreactions were performed using Geant4 and TALYS-2.0 codes. The obtained\\nexperimental results were compared with the available literature data and\\ncalculated results. The comparison showed that the values of the relative\\nreaction yield and the flux-averaged cross-section coincide with the literature\\ndata, taking into account the different geometry of the experiments. The\\ncalculated results coincide with the experimental ones only for reactions with\\nthe emission of up to 5 neutrons from the nucleus.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:07:31Z\"}"}
