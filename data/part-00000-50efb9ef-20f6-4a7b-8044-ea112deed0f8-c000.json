Recent studies have shown\\nthat quantum work can serve as an effective indicator of quantum phase\\ntransitions in systems subjected to sudden quenches. However, the potential of\\nquantum work to identify thermal phase transitions remains largely unexplored.\\nIn this paper, we examine several types of thermal phase transitions in a\\nsudden-quench hard-core boson model, including Ising, three-state Potts, and\\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Through finite-size scaling\\nanalysis, we conclude that work statistics can also characterize the critical\\nbehaviors of thermal phase transitions in generic many-body systems. Our\\ninvestigation paves the way for applying work statistics to characterize\\ncritical behavior in many-body systems, with implications that may extend to\\nbroader contexts.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:08:01Z\"}"}
