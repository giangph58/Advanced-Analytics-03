{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07545v1\", \"title\": \"Convexity Helps Iterated Search in 3D\", \"summary\": \"Inspired by the classical fractional cascading technique, we introduce new\\ntechniques to speed up the following type of iterated search in 3D: The input\\nis a graph $\\\\mathbf{G}$ with bounded degree together with a set $H_v$ of 3D\\nhyperplanes associated with every vertex of $v$ of $\\\\mathbf{G}$. The goal is to\\nstore the input such that given a query point $q\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^3$ and a\\nconnected subgraph $\\\\mathbf{H}\\\\subset \\\\mathbf{G}$, we can decide if $q$ is\\nbelow or above the lower envelope of $H_v$ for every $v\\\\in \\\\mathbf{H}$. We show\\nthat using linear space, it is possible to answer queries in roughly $O(\\\\log n\\n+ |\\\\mathbf{H}|\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ time which improves trivial bound of\\n$O(|\\\\mathbf{H}|\\\\log n)$ obtained by using planar point location data\\nstructures. Our data structure can in fact answer more general queries (it\\ncombines with shallow cuttings) and it even works when $\\\\mathbf{H}$ is given\\none vertex at a time. We show that this has a number of new applications and in\\nparticular, we give improved solutions to a set of natural data structure\\nproblems that up to our knowledge had not seen any improvements.\\n  We believe this is a very surprising result because obtaining similar results\\nfor the planar point location problem was known to be impossible.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CG\", \"categories\": \"cs.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:20:36Z\"}"}
