{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21780v1\", \"title\": \"Semantic Library Adaptation: LoRA Retrieval and Fusion for\\n  Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models associate vision and text to\\nlabel pixels from an undefined set of classes using textual queries, providing\\nversatile performance on novel datasets. However, large shifts between training\\nand test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective\\nreal-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a\\nnovel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages\\na library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically\\nmerging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in\\nthe embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each\\nspecific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently,\\nenhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently\\nprotects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications.\\nComprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard\\ndatasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across\\ndiverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for\\nopen-vocabulary semantic segmentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:58Z\"}"}
