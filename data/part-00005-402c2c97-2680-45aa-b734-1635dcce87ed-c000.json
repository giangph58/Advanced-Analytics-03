Nayaka, Dharmendra and Kumar proved some congruences modulo 8, 16 and 32\\nfor $\\\\overline{bt}(n)$. Recently, Saikia and Sarma established some congruences\\nmodulo 64 for $\\\\overline{bt}(n)$ by using both elementary techniques and the\\ntheory of modular forms. In their paper, they also posed two conjectures on\\ninfinite families of congruences modulo 64 and 128 for $\\\\overline{bt}(n)$. In\\nthis paper, we confirm the two conjectures.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NT\", \"categories\": \"math.NT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:49:16Z\"}"}
