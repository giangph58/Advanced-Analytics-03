Toward such a socially acceptable Human-Robot Interaction, we\\nconducted a study ($N=24$) in an AR-simulated context of a coffee chat.\\nParticipants elicited social cues to signal intentions to an anthropomorphic,\\nzoomorphic, grounded technical, or aerial technical robot waiter when they were\\nspeakers or listeners. Our findings reveal common patterns of social cues over\\nintentions, the effects of robot morphology on social cue position and\\nconversational role on social cue complexity, and users' rationale in choosing\\nsocial cues. We offer insights into understanding social cues concerning\\nperceptions of robots, cognitive load, and social context. Additionally, we\\ndiscuss design considerations on approaching, social cue recognition, and\\nresponse strategies for future service robots.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:07:00Z\"}"}
