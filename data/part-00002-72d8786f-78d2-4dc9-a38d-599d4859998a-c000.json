For homogeneous positive systems, a static feedback\\nprotocol design is proposed, based on the Linear Regulator problem. The\\nsolution to the algebraic equation associated to the stabilizing policy can be\\nfound using a linear program. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the\\npositivity of each agent's trajectory for all nonnegative initial conditions\\nare also provided. Simulations on large regular graphs with different nodal\\ndegree illustrate the proposed results.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:08:07Z\"}"}
