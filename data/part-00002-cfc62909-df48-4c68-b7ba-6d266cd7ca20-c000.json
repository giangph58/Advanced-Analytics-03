Unlike the conventional (e.g.,\\nLandau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts\\nfor a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between\\nthe pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show\\nthat preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision\\nenergy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with\\nnon-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.comp-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.comp-ph,cs.LG,cs.NA,math.NA,physics.plasm-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:26:06Z\"}"}
