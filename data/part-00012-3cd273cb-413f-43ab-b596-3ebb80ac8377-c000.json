We present SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index), a unified\\narchitecture that models knowledge as a dynamically structured hierarchy of\\nconcepts, enabling agents to retrieve information based on meaning rather than\\nsurface similarity. SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and\\nsupports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering\\nmore precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed\\nfor decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and\\nsynchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight\\nsync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and\\nCRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal\\noverhead. Through benchmark experiments and use cases involving decentralized\\nagent collaboration, we demonstrate SHIMI's advantages in retrieval accuracy,\\nsemantic fidelity, and scalability - positioning it as a core infrastructure\\nlayer for decentralized cognitive systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:31:00Z\"}"}
