{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07888v1\", \"title\": \"The Role of Buffer Gas in Shaping the D1 Line Spectrum of Potassium\\n  Vapour\", \"summary\": \"In this study, we investigate the effect of buffer gas and magnetic field on\\nthe spectral line shapes of the potassium D1 transition using sealed vapour\\ncells filled with varying amounts of neon as a buffer gas. Employing a\\ndual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and\\nstem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum.\\nOur results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to\\nLorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by\\ncollisions between potassium atoms and neon. Our measurements are in excellent\\nagreement with the literature values for potassium-neon collisions. For the\\nfirst time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into\\nthe modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement\\nbetween the predicted and measured line profiles. We also analyse the potassium\\nD1 spectral lines in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime using strong magnetic\\nfields, demonstrating how Zeeman splitting modifies the pressure-broadened line\\nshape. This work provides valuable insights into collision-induced broadening\\nand shifts, enhancing our understanding of potassium spectroscopy and its\\napplication in the development of advanced magneto-optical filters for solar\\nphysics and other applications.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.atom-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.atom-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T16:01:57Z\"}"}
