Nevertheless, computing Khovanov homology of a given link\\nremains challenging in general with current techniques. In this work we focus\\non links that are the closure of positive 3-braids. Starting with a\\nclassification of conjugacy classes of 3-braids arising from the Garside\\nstructure of braid groups, we compute, for any closed positive 3-braid, the\\nfirst four columns (homological degree) and the three lowest rows (quantum\\ndegree) of the associated Khovanov homology table. Moreover, the number of rows\\nand columns we can describe increases with the infimum of the positive braid (a\\nGarside theoretical notion). We will show how to increase the infimum of a\\n3-braid to its maximal possible value by a conjugation, maximizing the number\\nof cells in the Khovanov homology of its closure that can be determined, and\\nshow that this can be done in linear time.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GT\", \"categories\": \"math.GT,math.AT,math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:35:15Z\"}"}
