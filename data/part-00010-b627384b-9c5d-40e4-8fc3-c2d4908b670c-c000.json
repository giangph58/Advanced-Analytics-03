Common solutions, such as\\nreporting and moderation, address harassment after it happens but fail to\\nprevent or stop harassment in the moment. In this study, we explore and design\\nproactive and instant-reactive safety designs to mitigate harassment in social\\nVR. Proactive designs prevent harassment from occurring, while instant-reactive\\ndesigns minimize harm during incidents. We explore three directions for design:\\nuser-initiated personal bubbles, clarifying social norms, and encouraging\\nbystander intervention. Through an iterative process, we first conducted a\\nformative interview study to determine design goals for making these features\\neffective, fit user needs, and robust to manipulation. We then implemented\\nPuffer, an integrated safety system that includes a suite of proactive and\\ninstant-reactive features, as a social VR prototype. From an evaluation using\\nsimulated scenarios with participants, we find evidence that Puffer can help\\nprotect players during emergencies, foster prosocial norms, and create more\\npositive social interactions. We conclude by discussing how system safety\\nfeatures can be designed to complement existing proactive and instant-reactive\\nstrategies, particularly for people with marginalized identities.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:05:11Z\"}"}
