{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04835v1\", \"title\": \"Inland Waterway Object Detection in Multi-environment: Dataset and\\n  Approach\", \"summary\": \"The success of deep learning in intelligent ship visual perception relies\\nheavily on rich image data. However, dedicated datasets for inland waterway\\nvessels remain scarce, limiting the adaptability of visual perception systems\\nin complex environments. Inland waterways, characterized by narrow channels,\\nvariable weather, and urban interference, pose significant challenges to object\\ndetection systems based on existing datasets. To address these issues, this\\npaper introduces the Multi-environment Inland Waterway Vessel Dataset (MEIWVD),\\ncomprising 32,478 high-quality images from diverse scenarios, including sunny,\\nrainy, foggy, and artificial lighting conditions. MEIWVD covers common vessel\\ntypes in the Yangtze River Basin, emphasizing diversity, sample independence,\\nenvironmental complexity, and multi-scale characteristics, making it a robust\\nbenchmark for vessel detection. Leveraging MEIWVD, this paper proposes a\\nscene-guided image enhancement module to improve water surface images based on\\nenvironmental conditions adaptively. Additionally, a parameter-limited dilated\\nconvolution enhances the representation of vessel features, while a multi-scale\\ndilated residual fusion method integrates multi-scale features for better\\ndetection. Experiments show that MEIWVD provides a more rigorous benchmark for\\nobject detection algorithms, and the proposed methods significantly improve\\ndetector performance, especially in complex multi-environment scenarios.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:45:00Z\"}"}
