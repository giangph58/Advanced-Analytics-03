Here we\\nfocus on the behaviors of Lorentz-Drude dipoles when their radiative rate\\ndominates their energy loss. We show that dipole radiation losses do not count\\ntoward phenomenological dipole losses if the driving field is interpreted as\\nthe total field at the dipole. In particular, if the dipole does not contain\\nnon-radiative losses, then the Lorentz-Drude damping term should be removed.\\nThis is verified by self-consistent implementations of point dipoles in\\nfinite-difference time-domain simulations, which also provide a method to\\ndirectly compute the transport properties of light when dipoles are present.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.class-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:24:54Z\"}"}
