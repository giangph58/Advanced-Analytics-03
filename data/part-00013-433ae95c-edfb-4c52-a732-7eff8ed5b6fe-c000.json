Traditional FWI employs\\nthe $l_2$ norm measurement to minimize the misfit between observed and\\npredicted seismic data. However, when the background velocity is inaccurate or\\nthe seismic data lacks low-frequency components, the conventional FWI suffers\\nfrom cycle skipping, leading to inaccurate inversion results. This paper\\nintroduces a multiscale structural similarity index measure (M-SSIM) objective\\nfunction for FWI. We also incorporate anisotropic total p-variation\\nregularization (ATpV) to further improve the accuracy of FWI. M-SSIM extracts\\nmulti-scale structural features of seismic data in terms of both phase and\\namplitude. These features can reduce the risk of cycle skipping and improve the\\nstability of FWI. Additionally, ATpV applies structural constraints to the\\nvelocity gradients, which helps suppress artifacts and preserve the sharp\\nboundaries of geological formations. We propose to use the automatic\\ndifferentiation (AD) to efficiently and stably optimize this novelly introduced\\nFWI objective function. Both synthetic and field seismic data demonstrate that\\nthe proposed method accurately characterizes complex subsurface velocity\\nstructures, even when the background velocity is crude, the data lacks\\nlow-frequency components, or contains noise.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:55:11Z\"}"}
