{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05148v1\", \"title\": \"Stereo-LiDAR Fusion by Semi-Global Matching With Discrete\\n  Disparity-Matching Cost and Semidensification\", \"summary\": \"We present a real-time, non-learning depth estimation method that fuses Light\\nDetection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with stereo camera input. Our approach\\ncomprises three key techniques: Semi-Global Matching (SGM) stereo with Discrete\\nDisparity-matching Cost (DDC), semidensification of LiDAR disparity, and a\\nconsistency check that combines stereo images and LiDAR data. Each of these\\ncomponents is designed for parallelization on a GPU to realize real-time\\nperformance. When it was evaluated on the KITTI dataset, the proposed method\\nachieved an error rate of 2.79\\\\%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art\\nreal-time stereo-LiDAR fusion method, which had an error rate of 3.05\\\\%.\\nFurthermore, we tested the proposed method in various scenarios, including\\ndifferent LiDAR point densities, varying weather conditions, and indoor\\nenvironments, to demonstrate its high adaptability. We believe that the\\nreal-time and non-learning nature of our method makes it highly practical for\\napplications in robotics and automation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:54:08Z\"}"}
