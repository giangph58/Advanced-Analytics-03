While previous research has predominantly focused on\\noptimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical\\nproperties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using\\nstochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions\\nof power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how\\nthermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values\\nexceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis\\ndemonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the\\nprobability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting\\nfluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be\\nprobabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class\\nof engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully\\ndetermined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper\\nunderstanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how\\nstochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic\\nbounds.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:29:46Z\"}"}
