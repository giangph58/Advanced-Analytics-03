The present paper investigates the possible\\nexistence of the PDR built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge\\nnucleus using the phonon damping model (PDM) with and without pairing\\ncorrelation at zero and finite temperatures. The results obtained within the\\nPDM with exact pairing (EP+PDM) reveal the appearance of two enhanced\\n$\\\\gamma$-transitions $E_\\\\gamma = 7.25$ and 7.35 MeV at $T=0.6$ MeV, which carry\\nthe PDR nature and hence implying the possible existence of PDR built on\\nexcited states in this nucleus. These two $\\\\gamma$-energies nicely match with a\\nrecent experimental observation, thus indicating the crucial role of the\\ninclusion of exact pairing solution in the precise description of low-lying\\n$\\\\gamma$-transitions. The partition function-based analysis shows that this\\npredicted PDR at $T=$ 0.6MeV is mainly contributed by the first $2^+$ excited\\nstate of the $^{80}$Ge nucleus. The isospin mixing at the nuclear surface is\\nalso observed in the investigated PDR at $T=0.6-0.7$ MeV. The primary mechanism\\nunderlying the emergence of the hot PDR is found due to the coupling of GDR\\nphonon to non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole configurations at\\nfinite temperatures within the PDM framework, along with the shift in\\nparticle-hole excitation energies due to thermal pairing correlations\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:23:37Z\"}"}
