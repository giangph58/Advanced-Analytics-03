We search for RS candidates using data\\nfrom the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this\\ncase the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in\\nopposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate\\nRS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body\\nsystems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation\\nand causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster\\nwith a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in\\na 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used\\nas a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal\\nonly one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out\\nof an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.SR\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.SR,astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:57:10Z\"}"}
