In this work, we explore via numerical\\nsimulations and analytical calculations the feasibility of the separation of\\nchiral molecules by using guided light in a dielectric slot waveguide. Our\\nresults suggest that it is possible to separate [6]helicene enantiomers\\nsuspended in gas within several hours when applying optical powers of 100 mW.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:20:20Z\"}"}
