{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06159v1\", \"title\": \"Enhancing Primary Teacher Training through Academic Portfolios in\\n  Advanced Mathematics Courses\", \"summary\": \"The gap between theory and practice in mathematics education, particularly in\\nprimary-teacher education, necessitates innovative teaching methodologies. This\\npaper explores the implementation of academic portfolios as a teaching\\ninnovation in Algebra and Number Systems I and II courses within the primary\\nteacher education programme at Pontificia Universidad Cat\\\\'olica de Chile. The\\nmethodology involved integrating academic portfolios to align course content\\nwith essential learning outcomes for future teaching roles. Implementation\\nbegins with a negotiation between students and teachers to establish a learning\\ncontract, followed by an overview of course rules, content, objectives,\\nmaterials, and grading rubrics. Preliminary findings indicate that this\\ninnovative method enhances engagement with mathematical concepts, improves\\nassessment efficacy in teacher training, and may contribute to enhanced\\npreparation of primary mathematics teachers. The study highlights the role of\\nportfolios in making students active participants in their learning,\\nsignificantly enhancing the educational experience of teacher candidates. These\\nfindings suggest a promising avenue for future educational assessments and\\nmethodologies in mathematics, indicating that academic portfolios can bridge\\nthe gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications in mathematics\\nteacher education, potentially enhancing teacher preparation. While this study\\nshows promising results, further research with larger samples and longer\\ntimeframes would be beneficial to establish causality and long-term impacts.\", \"main_category\": \"math.HO\", \"categories\": \"math.HO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:55:33Z\"}"}
