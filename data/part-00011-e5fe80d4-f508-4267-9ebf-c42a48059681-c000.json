The inclusion of\\nstochastic resetting enables the emergence of resonance phenomena even in\\nparameter regimes where conventional settings (without resetting) do not\\nexhibit such behavior. Specifically, we explore the response of the system to\\nan external field under three scenarios: (i) a free particle, (ii) a particle\\nin a harmonic potential, and (iii) the effect of truncation in the memory\\nkernel. In each case, the primary focus is on understanding how the resetting\\nmechanism interacts with standard parameters to induce stochastic resonance. In\\naddition, we explore the effect of resetting on the dielectric loss.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:48:11Z\"}"}
