MI is valid when incomplete variables are\\nindependent of response indicators, conditional on complete variables -\\nhowever, this can be hard to assess with multiple incomplete variables.\\nPrevious literature has shown that MI may be valid in subsamples of the data,\\neven if not necessarily valid in the full dataset. Current guidance on how to\\ndecide whether MI is appropriate is lacking.\\n  Methods: We develop an algorithm that is sufficient to indicate when MI will\\nestimate an exposure-outcome coefficient without bias and show how to implement\\nthis using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We extend the algorithm to\\ninvestigate whether MI applied to a subsample of the data, in which some\\nvariables and complete and the remaining are imputed, will be unbiased for the\\nsame estimand. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to several simple\\nexamples and a more complex real-life example.\\n  Conclusions: Multiple incomplete variables are common in practice. Assessing\\nthe plausibility of each of CRA and MI estimating an exposure-outcome\\nassociation without bias is crucial in analysing and interpreting results. Our\\nalgorithm provides researchers with the tools to decide whether (and how) to\\nuse MI in practice. Further work could focus on the likely size and direction\\nof biases, and the impact of different missing data patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:00:18Z\"}"}
