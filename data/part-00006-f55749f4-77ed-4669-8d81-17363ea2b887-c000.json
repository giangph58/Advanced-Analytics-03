{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01413v1\", \"title\": \"Quantum light sources with configurable lifetime leveraging parity-time\\n  symmetry\", \"summary\": \"Quantum light sources with configurable photon lifetimes are essential for\\nlarge-scale quantum circuits, enabling applications in programmable quantum\\ncomputing, various quantum key distribution protocols, and quantum tomography\\ntechniques. However, the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and photon\\nlifetime imposes significant challenges on the design of high-performance large\\nconfigurable lifetime quantum light sources. Here, we report on such chip-scale\\nquantum light sources by harnessing the unique feature of parity-time (PT)\\nsymmetry. The core design centers on employing PT-symmetric coupling between\\ntwo microresonators of distinct circumferences, enabling broad-range and\\nselective tuning of intracavity photon density of states. By controlling the\\nalignment between resonators, we achieved a 38-fold photon lifetime tuning\\nrange (4 ~ 158 ps), with the shortest lifetimes near the exceptional points of\\nthe PT-symmetric systems. The device generates energy-time entangled photon\\npairs with 87.1 +- 1.1% interference visibility and a heralded second-order\\nautocorrelation of g_h^((2) ) (0)= 0.069 +- 0.001. Our work highlights the\\npotential of PT symmetry for advanced quantum applications, including\\nhigh-speed communication and programmable quantum computing, quantum coherent\\ntomography, and beyond.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:04:31Z\"}"}
