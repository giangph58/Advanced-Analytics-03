{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05002v1\", \"title\": \"SmartBugBert: BERT-Enhanced Vulnerability Detection for Smart Contract\\n  Bytecode\", \"summary\": \"Smart contracts deployed on blockchain platforms are vulnerable to various\\nsecurity vulnerabilities. However, only a small number of Ethereum contracts\\nhave released their source code, so vulnerability detection at the bytecode\\nlevel is crucial. This paper introduces SmartBugBert, a novel approach that\\ncombines BERT-based deep learning with control flow graph (CFG) analysis to\\ndetect vulnerabilities directly from bytecode. Our method first decompiles\\nsmart contract bytecode into optimized opcode sequences, extracts semantic\\nfeatures using TF-IDF, constructs control flow graphs to capture execution\\nlogic, and isolates vulnerable CFG fragments for targeted analysis. By\\nintegrating both semantic and structural information through a fine-tuned BERT\\nmodel and LightGBM classifier, our approach effectively identifies four\\ncritical vulnerability types: transaction-ordering, access control,\\nself-destruct, and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. Experimental\\nevaluation on 6,157 Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that SmartBugBert\\nachieves 90.62% precision, 91.76% recall, and 91.19% F1-score, significantly\\noutperforming existing detection methods. Ablation studies confirm that the\\ncombination of semantic features with CFG information substantially enhances\\ndetection performance. Furthermore, our approach maintains efficient detection\\nspeed (0.14 seconds per contract), making it practical for large-scale\\nvulnerability assessment.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:30:12Z\"}"}
