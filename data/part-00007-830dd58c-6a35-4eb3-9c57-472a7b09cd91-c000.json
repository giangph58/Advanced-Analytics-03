{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07021v1\", \"title\": \"Polyspectral Mean based Time Series Clustering of Indian Stock Market\", \"summary\": \"In this study, we employ k-means clustering algorithm of polyspectral means\\nto analyze 49 stocks in the Indian stock market. We have used spectral and\\nbispectral information obtained from the data, by using spectral and bispectral\\nmeans with different weight functions that will give us varying insights into\\nthe temporal patterns of the stocks. In particular, the higher order\\npolyspectral means can provide significantly more information than what we can\\ngather from power spectra, and can also unveil nonlinear trends in a time\\nseries. Through rigorous analysis, we identify five distinctive clusters,\\nuncovering nuanced market structures. Notably, one cluster emerges as that of a\\nconglomerate powerhouse, featuring ADANI, BIRLA, TATA, and unexpectedly,\\ngovernment-owned bank SBI. Another cluster spotlights the IT sector with WIPRO\\nand TCS, while a third combines private banks, government entities, and\\nRELIANCE. The final cluster comprises publicly traded companies with dispersed\\nownership. Such clustering of stocks sheds light on intricate financial\\nrelationships within the stock market, providing valuable insights for\\ninvestors and analysts navigating the dynamic landscape of the Indian stock\\nmarket.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.ST\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.ST,stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:36:39Z\"}"}
