It incorporates dynamic\\ndecision-making influenced by social distances and captures accumulative\\nopinion diffusion caused by interrelated rumors. The model reflects the impact\\nof rumor spread on social network structures. Simulations validate its\\neffectiveness in explaining phenomena like the echo chamber effect and provide\\ninsights into opinion diffusion dynamics, with implications for understanding\\nsocial polarization and network evolution.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SI\", \"categories\": \"cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T13:26:30Z\"}"}
