Despite\\nthese successes, the robustness and consistency of LLMs in underrepresented\\nlanguages remain largely unexplored, especially concerning local dialects.\\nExisting benchmarks also focus on main dialects, neglecting LLMs' ability on\\nlocal dialect texts. In this paper, we introduce a Thai local dialect benchmark\\ncovering Northern (Lanna), Northeastern (Isan), and Southern (Dambro) Thai,\\nevaluating LLMs on five NLP tasks: summarization, question answering,\\ntranslation, conversation, and food-related tasks. Furthermore, we propose a\\nhuman evaluation guideline and metric for Thai local dialects to assess\\ngeneration fluency and dialect-specific accuracy. Results show that LLM\\nperformance declines significantly in local Thai dialects compared to standard\\nThai, with only proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 demonstrating some\\nfluency\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:49:45Z\"}"}
