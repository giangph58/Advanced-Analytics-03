{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01888v1\", \"title\": \"A novel gesture interaction control method for rehabilitation lower\\n  extremity exoskeleton\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid development of Rehabilitation Lower Extremity Robotic\\nExoskeletons (RLEEX) technology, significant advancements have been made in\\nHuman-Robot Interaction (HRI) methods. These include traditional physical HRI\\nmethods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based\\nHRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI\\nmethods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity,\\nsensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and,\\nmost importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the\\ninteraction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient\\nmotivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\\nnovel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB\\nmonocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps:\\ndetecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby\\napplying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to\\ncontrol gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a\\nfeasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high\\nlatency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a\\ngesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\\\\% and an average system\\nresponse time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI. The proposed\\nnon-contact HRI method represents a pioneering advancement in control\\ninteractions for RLEEX, paving the way for further exploration and development\\nin this field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.AI,cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:46:01Z\"}"}
