However, existing\\ncell nucleus segmentation methods only consider a single dataset (i.e., primary\\ndomain), while neglecting to leverage supplementary data from diverse sources\\n(i.e., auxiliary domains) to reduce overfitting and enhance the performance.\\nAlthough incorporating multiple datasets could alleviate overfitting, it often\\nexacerbates performance drops caused by domain shifts. In this work, we\\nintroduce Adversarial Multi-domain Alignment of Segment Anything Model\\n(AMA-SAM) that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to overcome these\\nobstacles through two key innovations. First, we propose a Conditional Gradient\\nReversal Layer (CGRL), a multi-domain alignment module that harmonizes features\\nfrom diverse domains to promote domain-invariant representation learning while\\npreserving crucial discriminative features for the primary dataset. Second, we\\naddress SAM's inherent low-resolution output by designing a High-Resolution\\nDecoder (HR-Decoder), which directly produces fine-grained segmentation maps in\\norder to capture intricate nuclei boundaries in high-resolution histology\\nimages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt SAM\\nfor multi-dataset learning with application to histology nuclei segmentation.\\nWe validate our method on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating\\nconsistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T16:59:39Z\"}"}
