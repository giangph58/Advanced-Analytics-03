{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05924v1\", \"title\": \"A Control-Oriented Simplified Single Particle Model with Grouped\\n  Parameter and Sensitivity Analysis for Lithium-Ion Batteries\", \"summary\": \"Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in transportation, energy storage, and\\nconsumer electronics, driving the need for reliable battery management systems\\n(BMS) for state estimation and control. The Single Particle Model (SPM)\\nbalances computational efficiency and accuracy but faces challenges in\\nparameter estimation due to numerous parameters. Current SPM models using\\nparabolic approximation introduce intermediate variables and hard to do\\nparameter grouping. This study presents a control-oriented SPM reformulation\\nthat employs parameter grouping and parabolic approximation to simplify model\\nparameters while using average and surface lithium-ion concentrations as model\\noutput. By parameter grouping, the original 17 parameters were reduced to 9\\ngrouped parameters. The reformulated model achieves a reduced-order ordinary\\ndifferential equation form while maintaining mathematical accuracy equivalent\\nto the pre-grouped discretized SPM. Through Sobol sensitivity analysis under\\nvarious current profiles, the grouped parameters were reduced from 9 to 6\\nhighly sensitive parameters. Results demonstrate that estimating these 6\\nparameters achieves comparable practical accuracy to estimating all 9\\nparameters, with faster convergence. This control-oriented SPM enhances BMS\\napplications by facilitating state estimation and control while reducing\\nparameter estimation requirements.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:28:40Z\"}"}
