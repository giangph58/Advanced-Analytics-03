{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659v1\", \"title\": \"Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars\", \"summary\": \"We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange\\nquark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal\\nheating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be\\nconsidered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence\\nof hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation\\nduring inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from\\nnon-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several\\norders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures\\nrelevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange\\nquark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including\\nelectrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing\\nequal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\\\\,\\nM_{\\\\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end\\nof the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational\\nwaveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to\\n$0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially\\ndetectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal\\nheating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having\\nmasses 1.8 to 2.0 $\\\\, M_{\\\\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift\\nduring the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6\\n$\\\\, M_{\\\\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange\\nquark stars.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:17:45Z\"}"}
