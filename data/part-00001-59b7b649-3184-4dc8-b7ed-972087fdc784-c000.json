{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24284v1\", \"title\": \"Value of Information-based Deceptive Path Planning Under Adversarial\\n  Interventions\", \"summary\": \"Existing methods for deceptive path planning (DPP) address the problem of\\ndesigning paths that conceal their true goal from a passive, external observer.\\nSuch methods do not apply to problems where the observer has the ability to\\nperform adversarial interventions to impede the path planning agent. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel Markov decision process (MDP)-based model for the DPP\\nproblem under adversarial interventions and develop new value of information\\n(VoI) objectives to guide the design of DPP policies. Using the VoI objectives\\nwe propose, path planning agents deceive the adversarial observer into choosing\\nsuboptimal interventions by selecting trajectories that are of low\\ninformational value to the observer. Leveraging connections to the linear\\nprogramming theory for MDPs, we derive computationally efficient solution\\nmethods for synthesizing policies for performing DPP under adversarial\\ninterventions. In our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed solution method in achieving deceptiveness under adversarial\\ninterventions and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to both\\nexisting DPP methods and conservative path planning approaches on illustrative\\ngridworld problems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:31:29Z\"}"}
