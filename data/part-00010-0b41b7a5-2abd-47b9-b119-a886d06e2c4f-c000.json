The Impacts of Strategically Withheld Recourse\", \"summary\": \"Individuals often aim to reverse undesired outcomes in interactions with\\nautomated systems, like loan denials, by either implementing system-recommended\\nactions (recourse), or manipulating their features. While providing recourse\\nbenefits users and enhances system utility, it also provides information about\\nthe decision process that can be used for more effective strategic\\nmanipulation, especially when the individuals collectively share such\\ninformation with each other.\\n  We show that this tension leads rational utility-maximizing systems to\\nfrequently withhold recourse, resulting in decreased population utility,\\nparticularly impacting sensitive groups.\\n  To mitigate these effects, we explore the role of recourse subsidies, finding\\nthem effective in increasing the provision of recourse actions by rational\\nsystems, as well as lowering the potential social cost and mitigating\\nunfairness caused by recourse withholding.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GT\", \"categories\": \"cs.GT,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:36:16Z\"}"}
