{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05789v1\", \"title\": \"Leveraging Synthetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised Infant Pose\\n  Estimation\", \"summary\": \"Human pose estimation is a critical tool across a variety of healthcare\\napplications. Despite significant progress in pose estimation algorithms\\ntargeting adults, such developments for infants remain limited. Existing\\nalgorithms for infant pose estimation, despite achieving commendable\\nperformance, depend on fully supervised approaches that require large amounts\\nof labeled data. These algorithms also struggle with poor generalizability\\nunder distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIFT:\\nLeveraging SyntHetic Adult Datasets for Unsupervised InFanT Pose Estimation,\\nwhich leverages the pseudo-labeling-based Mean-Teacher framework to compensate\\nfor the lack of labeled data and addresses distribution shifts by enforcing\\nconsistency between the student and the teacher pseudo-labels. Additionally, to\\npenalize implausible predictions obtained from the mean-teacher framework, we\\nincorporate an infant manifold pose prior. To enhance SHIFT's self-occlusion\\nperception ability, we propose a novel visibility consistency module for\\nimproved alignment of the predicted poses with the original image. Extensive\\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks show that SHIFT significantly outperforms\\nexisting state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pose estimation\\nmethods by 5% and supervised infant pose estimation methods by a margin of 16%.\\nThe project page is available at: https://sarosijbose.github.io/SHIFT.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:13:38Z\"}"}
