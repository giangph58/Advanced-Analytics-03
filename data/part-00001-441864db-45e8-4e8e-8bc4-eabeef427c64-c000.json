{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04778v1\", \"title\": \"Abundance of weird quasiperiodic attractors in piecewise linear\\n  discontinuous maps\", \"summary\": \"In this work, we consider a class of $n$-dimensional, $n\\\\geq2$, piecewise\\nlinear discontinuous maps that can exhibit a new type of attractor, called a\\nweird quasiperiodic attractor. While the dynamics associated with these\\nattractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered\\nclass of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions,\\nseparated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic,\\nbeyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real\\nfixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed\\npoint itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in\\nnongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment\\nof straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic\\nattractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor,\\nwhich may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the\\nexistence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with\\ndifferent types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of\\ndiscontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to\\nthe appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the\\nthree-dimensional space. Several properties of this new type of attractor\\nremain open for further investigation.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DS\", \"categories\": \"math.DS,nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:14:14Z\"}"}
