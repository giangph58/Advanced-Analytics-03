{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06821v1\", \"title\": \"Inducing Programmatic Skills for Agentic Tasks\", \"summary\": \"To succeed in common digital tasks such as web navigation, agents must carry\\nout a variety of specialized tasks such as searching for products or planning a\\ntravel route. To tackle these tasks, agents can bootstrap themselves by\\nlearning task-specific skills online through interaction with the web\\nenvironment. In this work, we demonstrate that programs are an effective\\nrepresentation for skills. We propose agent skill induction (ASI), which allows\\nagents to adapt themselves by inducing, verifying, and utilizing program-based\\nskills on the fly. We start with an evaluation on the WebArena agent benchmark\\nand show that ASI outperforms the static baseline agent and its text-skill\\ncounterpart by 23.5% and 11.3% in success rate, mainly thanks to the\\nprogrammatic verification guarantee during the induction phase. ASI also\\nimproves efficiency by reducing 10.7-15.3% of the steps over baselines, by\\ncomposing primitive actions (e.g., click) into higher-level skills (e.g.,\\nsearch product). We then highlight the efficacy of ASI in remaining efficient\\nand accurate under scaled-up web activities. Finally, we examine the\\ngeneralizability of induced skills when transferring between websites, and find\\nthat ASI can effectively reuse common skills, while also updating incompatible\\nskills to versatile website changes.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T12:25:37Z\"}"}
