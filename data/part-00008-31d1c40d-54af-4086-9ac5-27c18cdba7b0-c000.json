{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05859v1\", \"title\": \"Gate-tunable hot electron extraction in a two-dimensional semiconductor\\n  heterojunction\", \"summary\": \"Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs), harvesting excess energy of the hot carriers\\ngenerated by above-band-gap photoexcitation, is crucial for pushing the solar\\ncell efficiency beyond the Shockley Queisser limit, which is challenging to\\nrealize mainly due to fast hot-carrier cooling. By performing transient\\nreflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the\\ngate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally\\ndistinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we\\nfind that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron\\nextraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises\\nfrom interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the\\nexcess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence\\ngenerates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the\\nconduction band offset with external electric field. Our results provide\\nin-depth insights into design of HCSCs with electrostatic strategies.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:36:31Z\"}"}
