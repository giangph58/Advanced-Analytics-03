We also examine quantities that, during the relaxation\\nprocess, exhibit dynamical manifestations of spectral correlations as in random\\nmatrix theory and investigate how these manifestations affect their\\nequilibration times. We refer to systems presenting these spectral correlations\\nas chaotic quantum systems, although the correct term to be employed, whether\\nchaotic or ergodic quantum systems, is debatable and both have limitations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T14:44:37Z\"}"}
