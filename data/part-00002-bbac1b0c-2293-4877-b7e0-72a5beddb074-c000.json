{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02352v1\", \"title\": \"Liquid Neural Networks: Next-Generation AI for Telecom from First\\n  Principles\", \"summary\": \"Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with\\nimmense potential to reshape the next-generation of wireless networks. By\\nleveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, AI offers\\nunprecedented capabilities in optimizing network performance, enhancing data\\nprocessing efficiency, and enabling smarter decision-making processes. However,\\nexisting AI solutions face significant challenges in terms of robustness and\\ninterpretability. Specifically, current AI models exhibit substantial\\nperformance degradation in dynamic environments with varying data\\ndistributions, and the black-box nature of these algorithms raises concerns\\nregarding safety, transparency, and fairness. This presents a major challenge\\nin integrating AI into practical communication systems. Recently, a novel type\\nof neural network, known as the liquid neural networks (LNNs), has been\\ndesigned from first principles to address these issues. In this paper, we\\nexplore the potential of LNNs in telecommunications. First, we illustrate the\\nmechanisms of LNNs and highlight their unique advantages over traditional\\nnetworks. Then we unveil the opportunities that LNNs bring to future wireless\\nnetworks. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and design directions for the\\nimplementation of LNNs. Finally, we summarize the performance of LNNs in two\\ncase studies.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:41:04Z\"}"}
