Methods that allow to propagate parameter\\nuncertainty are particularly indicated. These should ideally allow for\\ncompetition between and within species at various life-stages, and make the\\nbest out of multiple data sources, each of which can be relatively scarce by\\nstatistical standards. Here, we embed a mathematical model of stage-structured\\ncompetition between two species, producing analytical invasion criteria, into a\\ntwo-species Integrated Population Model. The community-level IPM allows to\\ncombine counts, capture-recapture, and fecundity data into a single statistical\\nframework, and the Bayesian formulation of the IPM fully propagates parameter\\nuncertainty into invasion criteria. Model fitting demonstrates that we can\\ncorrectly predict coexistence through reciprocal invasion when present, but\\nthat interaction strengths are not always estimable, depending on the prior\\nchosen. Our competitive exclusion scenario is shown to be harder to identify,\\nalthough our model allows to at least flag this scenario as uncertain rather\\nthan mistakenly present it as coexistence. Our results confirm the importance\\nof accounting for uncertainty in the prediction of competitive outcomes.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE,stat.AP,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:30:21Z\"}"}
