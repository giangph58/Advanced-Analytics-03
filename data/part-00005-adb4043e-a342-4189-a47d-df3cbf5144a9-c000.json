We express this process in terms of a linear combination\\nof Poisson processes and study several properties, including the summation of\\nindependent processes of the same family, some possible decompositions (which\\npresent particularly interesting characteristics) and the limit behaviors. In\\nthe case of homogeneous rate functions, a compound Poisson representation and a\\ndiscrete approximation are presented. Then, we study the fractional integral of\\nthe process as well as the iterated integral of the running average. Finally,\\nwe consider some time-changed versions related to L\\\\'{e}vy subordinators,\\nconnected to the Bernstein functions, and to the inverses of stable\\nsubordinators.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T11:50:01Z\"}"}
