{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04881v1\", \"title\": \"Critical Behaviour in the Single Flavor Thirring Model in 2+1$d$ with\\n  Wilson Kernel Domain Wall Fermions\", \"summary\": \"We present results of a lattice field theory simulation of the 2+1$d$\\nThirring model with $N=1$ fermion flavors, using domain wall fermions. The\\nmodel exhibits a U(2) symmetry-breaking phase transition with the potential to\\ndefine a UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. The novelty is the\\nreplacement of the Shamir kernel used in all previous work with the Wilson\\nkernel, improving the action particularly with respect to the $L_s\\\\to\\\\infty$\\nlimit needed to recover U(2), now under much better control. Auxiliary field\\nensembles generated on $16^3\\\\times24$ with varying self-interaction strength\\n$g^2$ and bare mass $m$ are used to measure the bilinear condensate order\\nparameter $\\\\langle\\\\bar\\\\psi i\\\\gamma_3\\\\psi\\\\rangle$ with domain wall separations\\nas large as $L_s=120$. The resulting $L_s\\\\to\\\\infty$ extrapolation is used to\\nfit an empirical equation of state modelling spontaneous symmetry breaking as\\n$m\\\\to0$. The fit is remarkably stable and compelling, with the fitted critical\\nexponents $\\\\beta_m\\\\simeq2.4$, $\\\\delta\\\\simeq1.3$ differing markedly from\\nprevious estimates. The associated susceptibility exhibits a mass hierarchy in\\nline with physical expectations, again unlike previous estimates.\\nSchwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) solutions of the Thirring model exploiting a\\nhidden local symmetry in the action are reviewed, and analytic predictions\\npresented for the exponents. In contrast to all previous lattice studies, the\\nuniversal characteristics of the critical point revealed qualitatively resemble\\nthe SDE predictions.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:42:48Z\"}"}
