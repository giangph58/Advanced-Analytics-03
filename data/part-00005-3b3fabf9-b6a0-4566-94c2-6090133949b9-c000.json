{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01611v1\", \"title\": \"The Mini-SiTian Array: Light Curves Analysis of Asteroids\", \"summary\": \"The SiTian project, with its vast field of view, will become an ideal\\nplatform for asteroid scientific research. In this study, we develop a pipeline\\nto analyze the photometry of asteroids and derive their periods from the data\\ncollected by the SiTian pathfinder project Mini-SiTian (MST). The pipeline is\\napplied to the MST f02 region, a MST test region with a sky area of\\n$2.29^{\\\\circ} \\\\times 1.53^{\\\\circ}$. Rotation periods of 22 asteroids are\\nderived by the obtained light curves analysis. Among them, there are 8\\nasteroids available in the Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database (ALCDEF),\\nand 6 of them with more photometric points ($>$200) have similar period\\nparameters as the ones in ALCDEF. Additionally, the periods for 14 of these\\nasteroids are newly obtained and are not listed in ALCDEF. This study\\ndemonstrates the feasibility of asteroid photometric research by the SiTian\\nproject. It shows that future observations from the SiTian project will provide\\neven more photometry of asteroids, significantly increasing the number of\\navailable light curves. The potential vast photometric data of asteroids will\\nhelp us to further understand the physics of asteroids, their material\\ncomposition, and the formation and evolution of the solar system.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.IM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:26:02Z\"}"}
