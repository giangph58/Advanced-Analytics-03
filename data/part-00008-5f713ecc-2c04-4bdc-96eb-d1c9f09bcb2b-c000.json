{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07939v1\", \"title\": \"Echo: An Open-Source, Low-Cost Teleoperation System with Force Feedback\\n  for Dataset Collection in Robot Learning\", \"summary\": \"In this article, we propose Echo, a novel joint-matching teleoperation system\\ndesigned to enhance the collection of datasets for manual and bimanual tasks.\\nOur system is specifically tailored for controlling the UR manipulator and\\nfeatures a custom controller with force feedback and adjustable sensitivity\\nmodes, enabling precise and intuitive operation. Additionally, Echo integrates\\na user-friendly dataset recording interface, simplifying the process of\\ncollecting high-quality training data for imitation learning. The system is\\ndesigned to be reliable, cost-effective, and easily reproducible, making it an\\naccessible tool for researchers, laboratories, and startups passionate about\\nadvancing robotics through imitation learning. Although the current\\nimplementation focuses on the UR manipulator, Echo architecture is\\nreconfigurable and can be adapted to other manipulators and humanoid systems.\\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of Echo through a series of experiments,\\nshowcasing its ability to perform complex bimanual tasks and its potential to\\naccelerate research in the field. We provide assembly instructions, a hardware\\ndescription, and code at https://eterwait.github.io/Echo/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:51:37Z\"}"}
