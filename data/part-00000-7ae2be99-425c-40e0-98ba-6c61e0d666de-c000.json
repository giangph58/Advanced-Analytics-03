By this construction, we obtain many examples of curvature-adapted\\nhypersurfaces in $G_1/K_1\\\\times G_2/K_2$. Also, we calculate the eigenvalues of\\nthe shape operator and the normal Jacobi operator of the curvature-adapted\\nhypersurfaces obtained by this construction.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:08:02Z\"}"}
