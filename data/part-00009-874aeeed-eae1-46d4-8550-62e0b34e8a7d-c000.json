{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06598v1\", \"title\": \"Stochastic Ray Tracing of 3D Transparent Gaussians\", \"summary\": \"3D Gaussian splatting has recently been widely adopted as a 3D representation\\nfor novel-view synthesis, relighting, and text-to-3D generation tasks, offering\\nrealistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussians\\ncarrying opacities and view-dependent colors. However, efficient rendering of\\nmany transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing\\napproaches either rasterize the 3D Gaussians with approximate sorting per view\\nor rely on high-end RTX GPUs to exhaustively process all ray-Gaussian\\nintersections (bounding Gaussians by meshes). This paper proposes a stochastic\\nray tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of\\nprocessing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray\\ntraverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading\\na single intersection (or N intersections, using a simple extension). This\\napproach minimizes shading time and avoids sorting the Gaussians along the ray\\nwhile minimizing the register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end\\nGPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of\\nstandard mesh-intersection rays. While our method introduces noise, the shading\\nis unbiased, and the variance is slight, as stochastic acceptance is\\nimportance-sampled based on accumulated opacity. The alignment with the Monte\\nCarlo philosophy simplifies implementation and easily integrates our method\\ninto a conventional path-tracing framework.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.GR\", \"categories\": \"cs.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T05:49:05Z\"}"}
