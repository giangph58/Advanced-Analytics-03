We consider a\\nconformal deformation of the contact form to obtain a complete, singular\\ncontact form and a corresponding Yamabe problem. We estimate then the Hausdorff\\ndimension of the singular set. The conformal geometry analog of this result is\\ndue to R. Schoen and S. -T. Yau. Results of this type have their origin in work\\nby Huber for Riemann surfaces. In the second part of our paper we investigate\\nthe CR developing map for three dimensional CR manifolds. We establish the\\ninjectivity of the developing map essentially using the same strategy as Schoen\\nand Yau for the conformal case which is based on the positive mass theorem.\\nHigher dimensional analogs of Huber's theorem in the conformal case for Q\\ncurvature are due to Alice Chang, Jie Qing and P.
