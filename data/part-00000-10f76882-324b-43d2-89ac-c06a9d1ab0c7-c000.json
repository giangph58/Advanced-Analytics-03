{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23781v1\", \"title\": \"DebFlow: Automating Agent Creation via Agent Debate\", \"summary\": \"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential and\\nimpressive performance in automating the generation and optimization of\\nworkflows. However, existing approaches are marked by limited reasoning\\ncapabilities, high computational demands, and significant resource\\nrequirements. To address these issues, we propose DebFlow, a framework that\\nemploys a debate mechanism to optimize workflows and integrates reflexion to\\nimprove based on previous experiences. We evaluated our method across six\\nbenchmark datasets, including HotpotQA, MATH, and ALFWorld. Our approach\\nachieved a 3\\\\% average performance improvement over the latest baselines,\\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in diverse problem domains. In particular,\\nduring training, our framework reduces resource consumption by 37\\\\% compared to\\nthe state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we performed ablation studies.\\nRemoving the Debate component resulted in a 4\\\\% performance drop across two\\nbenchmark datasets, significantly greater than the 2\\\\% drop observed when the\\nReflection component was removed. These findings strongly demonstrate the\\ncritical role of Debate in enhancing framework performance, while also\\nhighlighting the auxiliary contribution of reflexion to overall optimization.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T06:56:13Z\"}"}
