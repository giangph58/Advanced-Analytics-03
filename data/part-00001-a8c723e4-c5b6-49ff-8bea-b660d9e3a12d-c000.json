For\\nexample, when a user asks a robot to prepare avocado toast, the task involves\\nseveral sequential steps. Moreover, such instructions can be ambiguous or\\ninfeasible for the robot or may exceed the robot's existing knowledge. While\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) offer strong language reasoning capabilities to\\nhandle these challenges, effectively integrating them into robotic systems\\nremains a key challenge. To address this, we propose BT-ACTION, a test-driven\\napproach that combines the modular structure of Behavior Trees (BT) with LLMs\\nto generate coherent sequences of robot actions for following complex user\\ninstructions, specifically in the context of preparing recipes in a\\nkitchen-assistance setting. We evaluated BT-ACTION in a comprehensive user\\nstudy with 45 participants, comparing its performance to direct LLM prompting.\\nResults demonstrate that the modular design of BT-ACTION helped the robot make\\nfewer mistakes and increased user trust, and participants showed a significant\\npreference for the robot leveraging BT-ACTION. The code is publicly available\\nat https://github.com/1Eggbert7/BT_LLM.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:19:52Z\"}"}
