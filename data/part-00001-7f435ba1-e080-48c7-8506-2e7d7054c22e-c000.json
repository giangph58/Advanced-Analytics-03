This picture is only partially true: in reality, a given\\nparticle collides simultaneously with many partners and a more rigorous\\ntreatment should take this collective aspect of the collisions into account. A\\nframework for such treatment has been known in plasma physics since beginning\\nof the 1960s. In this work, we will show how it can be applied to IBS in\\nrelativistic beams for a particular problem of the growth of the beam energy\\nspread. A preliminary conclusion of this work is that the conventional IBS\\ntheory might underestimate the effects of long-range correlations in Coulomb\\ncollisions in the beam.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.acc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:21:07Z\"}"}
