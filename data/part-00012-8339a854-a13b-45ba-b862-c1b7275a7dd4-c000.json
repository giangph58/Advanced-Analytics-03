We propose an upper bound on the\\nredundancy of these codes, based on the minimum possible length of an\\nerror-correcting code with a given number of codewords and minimum distance.\\nAdditionally, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for the\\nfunction-correcting codes when $\\\\lambda = 4$. We also demonstrate that any\\nfunction can be represented as a $\\\\rho$-locally $\\\\lambda$-function,\\nillustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution\\nfunctions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting\\ncodes for Hamming weight distribution functions.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IT\", \"categories\": \"cs.IT,math.IT\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:41:51Z\"}"}
