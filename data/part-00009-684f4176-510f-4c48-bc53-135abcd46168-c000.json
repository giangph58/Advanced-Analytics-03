Recent\\nstudies have explored the use of AI to perform automatic extraction from CTI\\ndata, leveraging existing CTI datasets for performance evaluation and\\nfine-tuning. However, they present challenges and limitations that impact their\\neffectiveness. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel dataset manually\\nconstructed from CTI reports and structured according to the MITRE ATT&CK\\nframework. To assess its quality, we conducted an inter-annotator agreement\\nstudy using Krippendorff alpha, confirming its reliability. Furthermore, the\\ndataset was used to evaluate a Large Language Model (LLM) in a real-world\\nbusiness context, showing promising generalizability.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CR\", \"categories\": \"cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:47:15Z\"}"}
