They provide a technically and\\nconceptually simple approach to magnification. We generalize and strengthen\\nknown general (not problem specific) magnification results and in particular\\nachieve magnification thresholds below known lower bounds. For example, we show\\nthat fixed polynomial formula size lower bounds for NP are implied by slightly\\nsuperlinear formula size lower bounds for approximating any sufficiently sparse\\nproblem in NP. We also show that the thresholds achieved are sharp.\\nAdditionally, our approach yields a uniform magnification result for the\\nminimum circuit size problem. This seems to sidestep the localization barrier.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CC\", \"categories\": \"cs.CC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:21:56Z\"}"}
