{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02335v1\", \"title\": \"Evaluating and Enhancing Segmentation Model Robustness with Metamorphic\\n  Testing\", \"summary\": \"Image segmentation is critical for applications such as medical imaging,\\naugmented reality, and video surveillance. However, segmentation models often\\nlack robustness, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations from\\nsubtle image distortions. In this work, we propose SegRMT, a metamorphic\\ntesting approach that leverages genetic algorithms (GA) to optimize sequences\\nof spatial and spectral transformations while preserving image fidelity via a\\npredefined PSNR threshold. Using the Cityscapes dataset, our method generates\\nadversarial examples that effectively challenge the DeepLabV3 segmentation\\nmodel. Our experiments show that SegRMT reduces DeepLabV3's mean Intersection\\nover Union (mIoU) to 6.4%, outperforming other adversarial baselines that\\ndecrease mIoU to between 8.5% and 21.7%. Furthermore, when used for adversarial\\ntraining, SegRMT boosts model performance, achieving mIoU improvements up to\\n73% on dedicated adversarial datasets and increasing cross-adversarial mIoU to\\n53.8%, compared to only 2%-10% for other methods. These findings demonstrate\\nthat SegRMT not only simulates realistic image distortions but also enhances\\nthe robustness of segmentation models, making it a valuable tool for ensuring\\nreliable performance in safety-critical applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T07:15:45Z\"}"}
