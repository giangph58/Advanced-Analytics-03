Guo, Kang and Zwaneveld\\nrecently studied the relationship between the $d$-defective chromatic number of\\nthe $(d+1)$-fold (clique) blowup $G\\\\boxtimes K_{d+1}$ of a graph $G$ and its\\nordinary chromatic number, and conjectured that $\\\\chi(G)=\\\\chi^d(G\\\\boxtimes\\nK_{d+1})$ for every graph $G$ and $d\\\\ge 0$. In this note we disprove this\\nconjecture by constructing graphs $G$ of arbitrarily large chromatic number\\nsuch that $\\\\chi(G)\\\\ge \\\\frac{30}{29}\\\\chi^d(G\\\\boxtimes K_{d+1})$ for infinitely\\nmany $d$. On the positive side, we show that the conjecture holds with a\\nconstant factor correction, namely $\\\\chi^d(G\\\\boxtimes K_{d+1})\\\\le \\\\chi(G)\\\\le\\n2\\\\chi^d(G\\\\boxtimes K_{d+1})$ for every graph $G$ and $d\\\\ge 0$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:44:52Z\"}"}
