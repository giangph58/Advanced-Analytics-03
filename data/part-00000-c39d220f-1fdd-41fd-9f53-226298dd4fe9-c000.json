{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07555v1\", \"title\": \"Just TestIt! An SBST Approach To Automate System-Integration Testing\", \"summary\": \"This paper introduces TestIt, an open-source Python package designed to\\nautomate full-system integration testing using a Software-Based Self-Test\\n(SBST) approach. By dynamically generating test vectors and golden references,\\nTestIt significantly reduces development time and complexity while supporting\\nboth simulation and FPGA environments. Its flexible design positions TestIt as\\na key enabler for the widespread adoption of CI/CD methodologies in open-source\\nRTL development. A case study on the X-HEEP RISC-V microcontroller (MCU), which\\nintegrates a custom accelerator, showcases TestIt's ability to detect hardware\\nand software faults that traditional formal methods may overlook. Furthermore,\\nthe case study highlights how TestIt can be leveraged to characterize system\\nperformance with minimal effort. By automating testing on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA\\ndevelopment board, we achieved a 11x speed-up with respect to RTL simulations.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AR\", \"categories\": \"cs.AR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:36:08Z\"}"}
