While hypergraph-based approaches\\nenhance cooperation, existing methods often generate arbitrary hypergraph\\nstructures and lack adaptability to environmental uncertainties. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose the Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Network (SDHN),\\nwhich employs stochastic Bernoulli hyperedges to explicitly model higher-order\\nmulti-robot interactions. By introducing a skewness loss, SDHN promotes an\\nefficient structure with Small-Hyperedge Dominant Hypergraph, allowing robots\\nto prioritize localized synchronization while still adhering to the overall\\ninformation, similar to human coordination. Extensive experiments on Moving\\nAgents in Formation and Robotic Warehouse tasks validate SDHN's effectiveness,\\ndemonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:41:57Z\"}"}
