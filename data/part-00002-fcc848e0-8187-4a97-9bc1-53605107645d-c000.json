{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05798v1\", \"title\": \"A Simple yet Highly Accurate Prediction-Correction Algorithm for\\n  Time-Varying Optimization\", \"summary\": \"This paper proposes a simple yet highly accurate prediction-correction\\nalgorithm, SHARP, for unconstrained time-varying optimization problems. Its\\nprediction is based on an extrapolation derived from the Lagrange interpolation\\nof past solutions. Since this extrapolation can be computed without Hessian\\nmatrices or even gradients, the computational cost is low. To ensure the\\nstability of the prediction, the algorithm includes an acceptance condition\\nthat rejects the prediction when the update is excessively large. The proposed\\nmethod achieves a tracking error of $O(h^{p})$, where $h$ is the sampling\\nperiod, assuming that the $p$th derivative of the target trajectory is bounded\\nand the convergence of the correction step is locally linear. We also prove\\nthat the method can track a trajectory of stationary points even if the\\nobjective function is non-convex. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high\\naccuracy of the proposed algorithm.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:26:24Z\"}"}
