{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945v1\", \"title\": \"Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the\\n  impact of collisions\", \"summary\": \"This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the\\nnature of the generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a\\nquantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed\\npoint of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface,\\narising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a\\nparadigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong\\ninteractions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic\\norder parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at\\nthe QCP, thus undergoing Landau damping at the level of one-loop self-energy.\\nWe resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations\\n(QBEs)for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have\\nfocussed on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and\\nassuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In\\nparticular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs. The final\\nresults show that that the emergent modes are long-lived and robust against the\\ndamping effects brought about the collision integral(s), exhibiting the same\\nqualitative features as obtained from the no-collision approximations.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:52:45Z\"}"}
