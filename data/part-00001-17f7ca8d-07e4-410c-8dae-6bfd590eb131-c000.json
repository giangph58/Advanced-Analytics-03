{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01783v1\", \"title\": \"CLaP -- State Detection from Time Series\", \"summary\": \"The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the\\nenvironment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series\\n(TS). These recordings encode the recognizable properties of latent states and\\ntransitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes.\\nThe unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their\\ntransitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). We introduce\\nCLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the\\npredictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised\\nsetting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data\\nsegments emerge from the same state or not. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a\\nclassifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between\\nsegments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the\\nsame latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification\\nquality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 391 TS from four\\nbenchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states\\nthan five state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime\\ntradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of\\nCLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.DB\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:46:42Z\"}"}
