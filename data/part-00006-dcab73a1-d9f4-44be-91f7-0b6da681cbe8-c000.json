While simulated trainings can boost competencies,\\nextracting meaningful insights from these practices to enhance simulation\\neffectiveness remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce Multimodal\\nEpistemic Network Analysis (MENA), a novel framework for analyzing caregiver\\nattitudes and emotions in an Augmented Reality setting and exploring how the\\nawareness of a virtual geriatric patient (VGP) impacts these aspects. MENA\\nenhances the capabilities of Epistemic Network Analysis by detecting positive\\nemotions, enabling visualization and analysis of complex relationships between\\ncaregiving competencies and emotions in dynamic caregiving practices. The\\nframework provides visual representations that demonstrate how participants\\nprovided more supportive care and engaged more effectively in person-centered\\ncaregiving with aware VGP. This method could be applicable in any setting that\\ndepends on dynamic interpersonal interactions, as it visualizes connections\\nbetween key elements using network graphs and enables the direct comparison of\\nmultiple networks, thereby broadening its implications across various fields.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:40:49Z\"}"}
