{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05206v1\", \"title\": \"Content-aware rankings: a new approach to rankings in scholarship\", \"summary\": \"Entity rankings (e.g., institutions, journals) are a core component of\\nacademia and related industries. Existing approaches to institutional rankings\\nhave relied on a variety of data sources, and approaches to computing outcomes,\\nbut remain controversial. One limitation of existing approaches is reliance on\\nscholarly output (e.g., number of publications associated with a given\\ninstitution during a time period). We propose a new approach to rankings - one\\nthat relies not on scholarly output, but rather on the type of citations\\nreceived (an implementation of the Scite Index). We describe how the necessary\\ndata can be gathered, as well as how relevant metrics are computed. To\\ndemonstrate the utility of our approach, we present rankings of fields,\\njournals, and institutions, and discuss the various ways Scite's data can be\\ndeployed in the context of rankings. Implications, limitations, and future\\ndirections are discussed.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DL\", \"categories\": \"cs.DL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:55:18Z\"}"}
