Internal chromatograms were\\nrecorded as a function of various parameters including carrier gas type and\\nflow rate, thus characterizing the novel miniCOMPACT detector array. This aids\\nto optimize the conditions for experiments with superheavy elements. The\\nbismuth progeny of $^{219}$Rn deposited on the SiO$_{2}$ surface of the\\nminiCOMPACT via diffusion-controlled deposition. Bismuth showed the expected\\nhigh reactivity towards the SiO$_{2}$ surface of the miniCOMPACT. Experiments\\nin argon and oxygen atmosphere showed no measurable differences in the\\ndeposition distribution of the activity. The intermediate 36-min $^{211}$Pb is\\na member of the $^{227}$Ac decay chain, feeding the studied bismuth isotope,\\nwas taken into account. To extract thermodynamical data from the results,\\nnamely the lower limit of the value of the adsorption enthalpy of Bi on\\nSiO$_{2}$, we performed Monte Carlo simulations, adapted to account for the\\nprecursor effect, and compared the experimental results to their output.\\nSimulations were also performed for bismuths heavier homologue, moscovium,\\nusing a theoretically predicted value for the adsorption enthalpy of this\\nelement on SiO$_{2}$. These suggest moscovium to adsorb in the first part of\\nthe miniCOMPACT detection array, in line with recent observations.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-ex\", \"categories\": \"nucl-ex,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T12:58:04Z\"}"}
