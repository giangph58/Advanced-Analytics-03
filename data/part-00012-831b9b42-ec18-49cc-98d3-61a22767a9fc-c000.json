In particular, we investigate for the\\nfirst time the impact of the flavor content of the strongly coupled QGP medium\\non the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks. It turns out that the\\ninstantaneous energy loss of light quarks is smallest for $N_f = 0$, and adding\\n$u(d)$ quarks and $s$ quark in the system increases this energy loss. In\\naddition, we found that the instantaneous energy loss in the strongly coupled\\nplasma is minimal near the critical temperature, but it increases as the system\\nmoves away from the critical endpoint due to rising temperature or chemical\\npotential.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T12:06:30Z\"}"}
