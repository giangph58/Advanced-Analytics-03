{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06708v1\", \"title\": \"Transport of electrolytes across nanochannels: the role of slip\", \"summary\": \"We characterize the electrokinetic flow due to the transport of electrolytes\\nembedded in nanochannels of varying cross-section with inhomogeneous slip on\\ntheir walls, modeled as an effective slip length on the channel wall. We show\\nthat, within linear response and Debye-Huckel regime, the transport\\ncoefficients, and so the fluxes, can be significantly improved by the presence\\nof a hydrophobic surface coating located at the narrowest section of the\\nnanochannel. Our model indicates that the enhancement is larger when\\nconsidering electric conductive walls in comparison to dielectric microchannel\\nwalls, and it is produced by a synergy between the entropic effects due to the\\ngeometry and the presence of the slip boundary layer. Our results show that a\\ntailored hydrophobic coating design can be an effective strategy to improve\\ntransport properties in the broad areas of lab-on-a-chip, biophysics, and blue\\nenergy harvesting and energy conversion technologies.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.flu-dyn\", \"categories\": \"physics.flu-dyn,cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:09:52Z\"}"}
