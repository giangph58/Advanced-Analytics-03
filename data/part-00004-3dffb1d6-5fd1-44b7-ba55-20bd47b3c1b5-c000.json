This study puts a focus on engineered carbonate\\nprecipitation through biomineralization in a fault zone of a cap-rock to reduce\\ngas leakage from a reservoir. Besides hydraulic properties like porosity and\\npermeability, precipitated carbonates also change the mechanical properties of\\nthe rock. We present a conceptual modeling approach implemented into the\\nopen-source simulator Dumux and, after verification examples, at hand of a\\nCO2-storage scenario, we discuss impacts of biomineralization on the stress\\ndistribution in the rock and potentially altered risks of fault reactivations\\nand induced seismic events.\\n  The generic study shows the tendency towards increased stiffness due to\\nprecipitated carbonate, which may cause shear failure events to occur earlier\\nthan in an untreated setup, while the magnitude of the seismicity is smaller.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T15:15:12Z\"}"}
