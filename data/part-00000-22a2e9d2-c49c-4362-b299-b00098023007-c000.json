Dark matter halos (and, therefore, galaxies) form and grow\\nwithin the cosmic web - the classification of large-scale structure as distinct\\nenvironments, namely voids, walls, filaments and nodes. Thanks to the rapid\\ndevelopment of extragalactic spectroscopic redshift surveys and cosmological\\nsimulations over the last two decades, we are now able to measure the impact of\\nthe cosmic web on galaxies and halos in observations and in simulations. In\\nthis chapter we summarise the state of play in our understanding of the link\\nbetween dark matter halos, galaxies, and the cosmic web.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:57:19Z\"}"}
