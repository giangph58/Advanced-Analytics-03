In both cases, arbitrarily large but smooth initial data is\\nconsidered, and the evolving fluid domains remain bounded for all time. In the\\nviscous pressureless case, we are able to identify the terminal flow domain in\\nterms of the initial data. In the viscous almost pressureless case, we\\nconstruct the flow as a perturbation of the viscous pressureless flow, and\\nestablish the first result for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in the current\\nsetting.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T14:33:33Z\"}"}
