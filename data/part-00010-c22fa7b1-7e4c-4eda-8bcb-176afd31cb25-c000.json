Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is\\na Gaussian process, whose covariance depends on the so-called Hurst parameter\\n$H\\\\in (0,1)$. Consequently, stochastic models with fBm also depend on the Hurst\\nparameter $H$, and the stability of these models with respect to $H$ is an\\ninteresting and important question. In recent years, the continuous (or even\\nsmoother) dependence on the Hurst parameter has been studied for several\\nstochastic models, including stochastic integrals with respect to fBm,\\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fBm and also stochastic\\npartial differential equations with fractional noise, for different topologies,\\ne.g., in law or almost surely, and for finite and infinite time horizons. In\\nthis manuscript, we give an overview of these results with a particular focus\\non SDE models.\", \"main_category\": \"math.PR\", \"categories\": \"math.PR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:17:59Z\"}"}
