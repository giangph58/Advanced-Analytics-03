To simultaneously avoid these risks, the author modified\\nconvolutional neural networks data transformation functions by incorporating a\\nmodified geometric transformation function to improve the quality of augmented\\ndata by removing the reliance on nearest neighbor interpolation and integrating\\na mean based class filtering mechanism to handle undefined categorical labels\\nwith alternative interpolation algorithms. Experiments on semantic segmentation\\ntasks using three medical image datasets demonstrated both qualitative and\\nquantitative improvements with alternative interpolation algorithms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:13:18Z\"}"}
