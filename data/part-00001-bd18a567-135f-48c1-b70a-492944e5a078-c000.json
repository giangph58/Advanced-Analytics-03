Most previous deep learning approaches focus solely on\\nhomogeneous regions and rely on single-structured data. This paper presents a\\nhybrid neural architecture that integrates time series and static data,\\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on the DroughtED dataset. Our results\\nillustrate the potential of designing neural models for the treatment of\\nheterogeneous data in climate related tasks and present reliable prediction of\\nUSDM categories, an expert-informed drought metric. Furthermore, this work\\nvalidates the potential of DroughtED for enabling location-agnostic training of\\ndeep learning models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:11:34Z\"}"}
