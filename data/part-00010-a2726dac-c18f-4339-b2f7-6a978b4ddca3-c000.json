We review\\nthis with a classical automaton consisting of an Ising spin chain which is then\\nrelated to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Based on this and\\ngeneralizing, we construct a new ``Necklace of Necklaces'' automaton with a\\ntorus-like topology that lends itself to represent the Dirac equation in 1 + 1\\ndimensions. Special attention has to be paid to its mass term, which\\nnecessitates this enlarged structure and a particular scattering operator\\ncontributing to the step-wise updates of the automaton. As discussed earlier,\\nsuch deterministic models of discrete spins or bits unavoidably become quantum\\nmechanical, when only slightly deformed.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP,nlin.CG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:37:12Z\"}"}
