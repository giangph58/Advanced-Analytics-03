{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07761v1\", \"title\": \"Exploring a Patch-Wise Approach for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection\", \"summary\": \"In an increasingly digitalized world, verifying the authenticity of ID\\ndocuments has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as\\ndigital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the\\ntopic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In\\nparticular, no publicly available data from real ID documents exists, and most\\nstudies rely on proprietary in-house databases that are not available due to\\nprivacy reasons. In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that\\nmakes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy\\n(i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel\\npatch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection. Our proposed\\napproach explores how privacy can be enhanced through: i) two levels of\\nanonymization for an ID document (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii)\\ndifferent patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data\\nvisible in the patch image. Also, state-of-the-art methods such as Vision\\nTransformers and Foundation Models are considered in the analysis. The\\nexperimental framework shows that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our\\nproposal achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at patch and ID document level, showing a\\ngood generalization to other databases. In addition to this exploration,\\nanother key contribution of our study is the release of the first publicly\\navailable database that contains 48,400 patches from both real and fake ID\\ndocuments, along with the experimental framework and models, which will be\\navailable in our GitHub.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.CR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:01:22Z\"}"}
