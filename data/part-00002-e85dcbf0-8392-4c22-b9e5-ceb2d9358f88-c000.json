{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06257v1\", \"title\": \"PainNet: Statistical Relation Network with Episode-Based Training for\\n  Pain Estimation\", \"summary\": \"Despite the span in estimating pain from facial expressions, limited works\\nhave focused on estimating the sequence-level pain, which is reported by\\npatients and used commonly in clinics. In this paper, we introduce a novel\\nStatistical Relation Network, referred to as PainNet, designed for the\\nestimation of the sequence-level pain. PainNet employs two key modules, the\\nembedding and the relation modules, for comparing pairs of pain videos, and\\nproducing relation scores indicating if each pair belongs to the same pain\\ncategory or not. At the core of the embedding module is a statistical layer\\nmounted on the top of a RNN for extracting compact video-level features. The\\nstatistical layer is implemented as part of the deep architecture. Doing so,\\nallows combining multiple training stages used in previous research, into a\\nsingle end-to-end training stage. PainNet is trained using the episode-based\\ntraining scheme, which involves comparing a query video with a set of videos\\nrepresenting the different pain categories. Experimental results show the\\nbenefit of using the statistical layer and the episode-based training in the\\nproposed model. Furthermore, PainNet outperforms the state-of-the-art results\\non self-reported pain estimation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T17:58:52Z\"}"}
