To address the problem of vector boson masses and nonrenormalizability\\nof the theory, algebraic formalism encompassing the effective action,\\nSchwinger-Keldysh path integral, and Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman\\nrenormalization is constructed. A new NJL-like model: the theory of current\\nmetric field interacting with fermions is proposed. Bosonization in this model\\ncan produce massless vector bosons under certain conditions which makes it a\\ncandidate grand unified theory. Both Higgs and non-Higgs effects can contribute\\nto particle masses.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T16:01:32Z\"}"}
