Assuming that\\nthe soliton's width is much smaller than its radius, we obtain the Hamilton\\nequations for its evolution. Then they are transformed into the Newton\\nequation, which is more convenient for applications. The general theory is\\nillustrated by the solution of the Newton equation for the case of the axially\\nsymmetric condensate cloud, which expands after switching off a harmonic trap.\\nThe validity of our approximate analytical approach is confirmed by comparison\\nwith the results of numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.PS\", \"categories\": \"nlin.PS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:53:00Z\"}"}
