{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02406v1\", \"title\": \"Lifecycle Management of Trustworthy AI Models in 6G Networks: The REASON\\n  Approach\", \"summary\": \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to play a key role in 6G networks\\nincluding optimising system management, operation, and evolution. This requires\\nsystematic lifecycle management of AI models, ensuring their impact on services\\nand stakeholders is continuously monitored. While current 6G initiatives\\nintroduce AI, they often fall short in addressing end-to-end intelligence and\\ncrucial aspects like trust, transparency, privacy, and verifiability.\\nTrustworthy AI is vital, especially for critical infrastructures like 6G. This\\npaper introduces the REASON approach for holistically addressing AI's native\\nintegration and trustworthiness in future 6G networks. The approach comprises\\nAI Orchestration (AIO) for model lifecycle management, Cognition (COG) for\\nperformance evaluation and explanation, and AI Monitoring (AIM) for tracking\\nand feedback. Digital Twin (DT) technology is leveraged to facilitate real-time\\nmonitoring and scenario testing, which are essential for AIO, COG, and AIM. We\\ndemonstrate this approach through an AI-enabled xAPP use case, leveraging a DT\\nplatform to validate, explain, and deploy trustworthy AI models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:56:29Z\"}"}
