{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05658v1\", \"title\": \"Identification and estimation of causal peer effects using instrumental\\n  variables\", \"summary\": \"In social science researches, causal inference regarding peer effects often\\nfaces significant challenges due to homophily bias and contextual confounding.\\nFor example, unmeasured health conditions (e.g., influenza) and psychological\\nstates (e.g., happiness, loneliness) can spread among closely connected\\nindividuals, such as couples or siblings. To address these issues, we define\\nfour effect estimands for dyadic data to characterize direct effects and\\nspillover effects. We employ dual instrumental variables to achieve\\nnonparametric identification of these causal estimands in the presence of\\nunobserved confounding. We then derive the efficient influence functions for\\nthese estimands under the nonparametric model. Additionally, we develop a\\ntriply robust and locally efficient estimator that remains consistent even\\nunder partial misspecification of the observed data model. The proposed robust\\nestimators can be easily adapted to flexible approaches such as machine\\nlearning estimation methods, provided that certain rate conditions are\\nsatisfied. Finally, we illustrate our approach through simulations and an\\nempirical application evaluating the peer effects of retirement on fluid\\ncognitive perception among couples.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:15:30Z\"}"}
