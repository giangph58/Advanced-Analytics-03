This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words\\nin her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing\\nthe frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that\\nastrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured\\nPoets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most\\nthroughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of\\nastrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both\\nin Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor\\nexpansion and predict $12 \\\\pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album.\\nThis analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and\\nscience, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in\\ndifferent fields of astrophysics.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.GA\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.SR,physics.ed-ph,physics.soc-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:05:48Z\"}"}
