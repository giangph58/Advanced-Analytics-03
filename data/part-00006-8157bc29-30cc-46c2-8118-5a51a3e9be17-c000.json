We\\nanalyze their technological iterations and collaborative design paradigms,\\nemphasizing breakthroughs in atomic-level structural accuracy, functional\\nprotein engineering, and multi-component biomolecular interaction modeling. Key\\ninnovations include AlphaFold3's diffusion-based framework for unified\\nbiomolecular prediction, RoseTTAFold's three-track architecture integrating\\nsequence and spatial constraints, RFDiffusion's denoising diffusion for de novo\\nprotein generation, and ProteinMPNN's inverse folding for sequence-structure\\nco-optimization. Despite transformative progress in applications such as binder\\ndesign, nanomaterials, and enzyme engineering, challenges persist in dynamic\\nconformational sampling, multimodal data integration, and generalization to\\nnon-canonical targets. We propose future directions, including hybrid\\nphysics-AI frameworks and multimodal learning, to bridge gaps between\\ncomputational design and functional validation in cellular environments.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:44:10Z\"}"}
