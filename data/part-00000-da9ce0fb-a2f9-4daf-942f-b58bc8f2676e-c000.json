It is surprising to find\\nthat when the ratio of the Zeeman field strength to the driving frequency is\\neven, the SO coupling strength can take any value, and suitable parameters can\\nbe found to stabilize the quantum spin dynamics of the system. However, when\\nthe ratio of the Zeeman field strength to the driving frequency is odd, the SO\\ncoupling strength can only take integer or half-integer values for the spin\\ndynamics of the system to possibly be stable.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.quant-gas\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:20:35Z\"}"}
