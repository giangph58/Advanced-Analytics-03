{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04729v1\", \"title\": \"On primitive prime divisors of the orders of Suzuki-Ree groups\\n  (corrected version)\", \"summary\": \"There is a well-known factorization of the number $2^{2m}+1$, with $m$ odd,\\nrelated to the orders of tori of simple Suzuki groups: $2^{2m}+1$ is a product\\nof $a=2^m+2^{(m+1)/2}+1$ and $b=2^m-2^{(m+1)/2}+1$. By the Bang-Zsigmondy\\ntheorem, there is a primitive prime divisor of $2^{4m}-1$, that is, a prime $r$\\nthat divides $2^{4m}-1$ and does not divide $2^i-1$ for any $i<4m$. It is easy\\nto see that $r$ divides $2^{2m}+1$, and so it divides one of the numbers $a$\\nand $b$. The main objective of this paper is to show that for every $m>5$, each\\nof $a$ and $b$ is divisible by some primitive prime divisor of $2^{4m}-1$. Also\\nwe prove similar results for primitive prime divisors related to the simple Ree\\ngroups. As an application, we find the independence and 2-independence numbers\\nof the prime graphs of almost simple Suzuki-Ree groups.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T04:45:29Z\"}"}
