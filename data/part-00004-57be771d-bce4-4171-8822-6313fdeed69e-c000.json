{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04786v1\", \"title\": \"Dynamic fabrication method of SNAP microresonators\", \"summary\": \"Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) technology has demonstrated the\\nrecord subangstrom fabrication precision of optical microresonators and\\nresonant photonic circuits at the optical fiber surface. However, fabrication\\nerrors arising from fluctuations of temperature, inscription parameters,\\nalignment inconsistencies, and other factors did not allow researchers to\\nachieve the subangstrom precision without sophisticated postprocessing. Here we\\nshow that the key fabrication method of SNAP structures -- CO$_2$ laser beam\\noptical fiber annealing -- suffers from significant fiber displacements which\\nmay introduce a few percent fabrication errors. To suppress the effects of\\nmisalignment, we develop a dynamic fabrication method employing a translating\\nbeam exposure and demonstrate its excellent precision. The effective fiber\\nradius variation of $\\\\sim 10 $nm is introduced with an error of $\\\\sim 0.1\\n$angstrom. We suggest that the remaining fabrication errors can be attributed\\nto laser power fluctuations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:31:13Z\"}"}
