{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07841v1\", \"title\": \"Anytime Single-Step MAPF Planning with Anytime PIBT\", \"summary\": \"PIBT is a popular Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) method at the core of many\\nstate-of-the-art MAPF methods including LaCAM, CS-PIBT, and WPPL. The main\\nutility of PIBT is that it is a very fast and effective single-step MAPF solver\\nand can return a collision-free single-step solution for hundreds of agents in\\nless than a millisecond. However, the main drawback of PIBT is that it is\\nextremely greedy in respect to its priorities and thus leads to poor solution\\nquality. Additionally, PIBT cannot use all the planning time that might be\\navailable to it and returns the first solution it finds. We thus develop\\nAnytime PIBT, which quickly finds a one-step solution identically to PIBT but\\nthen continuously improves the solution in an anytime manner. We prove that\\nAnytime PIBT converges to the optimal solution given sufficient time. We\\nexperimentally validate that Anytime PIBT can rapidly improve single-step\\nsolution quality within milliseconds and even find the optimal single-step\\naction. However, we interestingly find that improving the single-step solution\\nquality does not have a significant effect on full-horizon solution costs.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.MA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:21:23Z\"}"}
