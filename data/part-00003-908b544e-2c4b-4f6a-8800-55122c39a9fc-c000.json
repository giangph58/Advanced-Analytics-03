A number of MLIPs trained on\\nenergies and forces from density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing\\nsemi-local exchange-correlation (xc) functionals have recently been introduced.\\nHere, we benchmark the performance of six dispersion-corrected MLIPs on a\\ndataset of van der Waals heterobilayers containing between 4 and 300 atoms in\\nthe moir\\\\'e cell. Using various structure similarity metrics, we compare the\\nrelaxed heterostructures to the ground truth DFT results. With some notable\\nexceptions, the model precisions are comparable to the uncertainty on the DFT\\nresults stemming from the choice of xc-functional. We further explore how the\\nstructural inaccuracies propagate to the electronic properties, and find\\nexcellent performance with average errors on band energies as low as 35 meV.\\nOur results demonstrate that recent MLIPs after dispersion corrections are on\\npar with DFT for general vdW heterostructures, and thus justify their\\napplication to complex and experimentally relevant 2D materials.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:35:53Z\"}"}
