{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06965v1\", \"title\": \"A Deep Single Image Rectification Approach for Pan-Tilt-Zoom Cameras\", \"summary\": \"Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras with wide-angle lenses are widely used in\\nsurveillance but often require image rectification due to their inherent\\nnonlinear distortions. Current deep learning approaches typically struggle to\\nmaintain fine-grained geometric details, resulting in inaccurate rectification.\\nThis paper presents a Forward Distortion and Backward Warping Network\\n(FDBW-Net), a novel framework for wide-angle image rectification. It begins by\\nusing a forward distortion model to synthesize barrel-distorted images,\\nreducing pixel redundancy and preventing blur. The network employs a pyramid\\ncontext encoder with attention mechanisms to generate backward warping flows\\ncontaining geometric details. Then, a multi-scale decoder is used to restore\\ndistorted features and output rectified images. FDBW-Net's performance is\\nvalidated on diverse datasets: public benchmarks, AirSim-rendered PTZ camera\\nimagery, and real-scene PTZ camera datasets. It demonstrates that FDBW-Net\\nachieves SOTA performance in distortion rectification, boosting the\\nadaptability of PTZ cameras for practical visual applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T15:19:38Z\"}"}
