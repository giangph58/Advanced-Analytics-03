Though the model based\\nanalysis methods have been used for ND quantum thermometry, their accuracy has\\nyet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we apply model-free machine learning\\nwith the Gaussian process regression (GPR) to ND quantum thermometry and\\ncompare its capabilities with the existing methods. We prove that GPR provides\\nmore robust results than them, even for a small number of data points and\\nregardless of the data acquisition methods. This study extends the range of\\napplications of ND quantum thermometry with machine learning.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:24:10Z\"}"}
