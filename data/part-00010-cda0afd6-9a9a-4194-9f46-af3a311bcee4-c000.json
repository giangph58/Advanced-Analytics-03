{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01552v1\", \"title\": \"Identity-Based Language Shift Modeling\", \"summary\": \"The preservation of endangered languages is a widely discussed issue\\nnowadays. Languages represent essential cultural heritage and can provide\\nvaluable botanical, biological, and geographical information. Therefore, it is\\nnecessary to develop efficient measures to preserve and revitalize endangered\\nlanguages. However, the language shift process is complex and requires an\\ninterdisciplinary approach, including mathematical modeling techniques. This\\npaper develops a new mathematical model that extends previous works on this\\ntopic. We introduce the factor of ethnic identity, which is a proxy for a more\\ncomplex nexus of variables involved in an individual's self-identity and/or a\\ngroup's identity. This proxy is socially constructed rather than solely\\ninherited, shaped by community-determined factors, with language both indexing\\nand creating the identity. In our model, we divide speakers into groups\\ndepending on with which language they identify themselves with. Moreover, every\\ngroup includes monolinguals and bilinguals. The proposed model naturally allows\\nus to consider cases of language coexistence and describe a broader class of\\nlinguistic situations. For example, the simulation results show that our model\\ncan result in cyclic language dynamics, drawing a parallel to cell population\\nmodels. In this way, the proposed mathematical model can serve as a useful tool\\nfor developing efficient measures for language preservation and revitalization.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.soc-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.soc-ph,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T09:48:29Z\"}"}
