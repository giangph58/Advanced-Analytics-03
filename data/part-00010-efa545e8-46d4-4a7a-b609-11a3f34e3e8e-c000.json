{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784v1\", \"title\": \"Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2\", \"summary\": \"We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy\\nwithin modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent\\nobservational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory\\nformulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background\\naction in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity\\ncan naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter\\nchoices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest\\nDESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the\\nreconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits\\nquintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover,\\nthrough detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria,\\nwe compare the model with the quadratic one. Our results show that, due to its\\nrich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the\\nrealization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO,gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T11:17:20Z\"}"}
