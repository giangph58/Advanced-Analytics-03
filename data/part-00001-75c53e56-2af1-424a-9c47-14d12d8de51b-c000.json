The\\nsystem integrates sensor data acquisition, convolutional neural network-based\\nthreat detection, and user alert dissemination through various software modules\\nof the use case. We define the latency requirements for such a system,\\nsegmenting the end-to-end latency into computational and networking components.\\nOur empirical evaluation demonstrates the impact of vehicle speed and user\\ntrajectory on system reliability. The results provide insights for network\\noperators and smart city service providers, emphasizing the critical role of\\nlow-latency communication and how networks can enable relevant services for\\ntraffic safety.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DC\", \"categories\": \"cs.DC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:27:32Z\"}"}
