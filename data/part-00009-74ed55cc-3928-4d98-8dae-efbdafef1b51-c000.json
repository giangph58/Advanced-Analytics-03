In the former, nodes are embedded\\ninto 2D space for visualization purposes. In the latter, nodes are embedded\\ninto a high-dimensional vector space for downstream processing.\\nState-of-the-art algorithms for these two paradigms, force-directed layouts and\\nrandom-walk-based contrastive learning (such as DeepWalk and node2vec), have\\nlittle in common. In this work, we show that both paradigms can be approached\\nwith a single coherent framework based on established neighbor embedding\\nmethods. Specifically, we introduce graph t-SNE, a neighbor embedding method\\nfor two-dimensional graph layouts, and graph CNE, a contrastive neighbor\\nembedding method that produces high-dimensional node representations by\\noptimizing the InfoNCE objective. We show that both graph t-SNE and graph CNE\\nstrongly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of local structure\\npreservation, while being conceptually simpler.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.LG\", \"categories\": \"cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:16:03Z\"}"}
