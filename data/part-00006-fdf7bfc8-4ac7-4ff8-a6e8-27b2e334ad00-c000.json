{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07634v1\", \"title\": \"Agent That Debugs: Dynamic State-Guided Vulnerability Repair\", \"summary\": \"In recent years, more vulnerabilities have been discovered every day, while\\nmanual vulnerability repair requires specialized knowledge and is\\ntime-consuming. As a result, many detected or even published vulnerabilities\\nremain unpatched, thereby increasing the exposure of software systems to\\nattacks. Recent advancements in agents based on Large Language Models have\\ndemonstrated their increasing capabilities in code understanding and\\ngeneration, which can be promising to achieve automated vulnerability repair.\\nHowever, the effectiveness of agents based on static information retrieval is\\nstill not sufficient for patch generation. To address the challenge, we propose\\na program repair agent called VulDebugger that fully utilizes both static and\\ndynamic context, and it debugs programs in a manner akin to humans. The agent\\ninspects the actual state of the program via the debugger and infers expected\\nstates via constraints that need to be satisfied. By continuously comparing the\\nactual state with the expected state, it deeply understands the root causes of\\nthe vulnerabilities and ultimately accomplishes repairs. We experimentally\\nevaluated VulDebugger on 50 real-life projects. With 60.00% successfully fixed,\\nVulDebugger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for\\nvulnerability repair.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.SE\", \"categories\": \"cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T10:31:10Z\"}"}
