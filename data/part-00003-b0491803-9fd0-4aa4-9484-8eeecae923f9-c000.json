Recently, a generalized scheme called modulo hysteresis was\\nintroduced to account for hardware non-idealities. The encoding operator,\\nhowever, does not guarantee that the output signal is within the dynamic range\\nof the ADC. To resolve this, we propose a modified modulo hysteresis operator\\nand show identifiability of bandlimited signals from modulo hysteresis samples.\\nWe propose a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit and\\nvalidate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA,eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T10:45:44Z\"}"}
