This article provides a\\ncritical and timely overview of recent advancements in leveraging cognitive\\nsignals, particularly Eye-tracking (ET) signals, to enhance Language Models\\n(LMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By incorporating\\nuser-centric cognitive signals, these approaches address key challenges,\\nincluding data scarcity and the environmental costs of training large-scale\\nmodels. Cognitive signals enable efficient data augmentation, faster\\nconvergence, and improved human alignment. The review emphasises the potential\\nof ET data in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and mitigating\\nhallucinations in MLLMs, and concludes by discussing emerging challenges and\\nresearch trends.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:01:48Z\"}"}
