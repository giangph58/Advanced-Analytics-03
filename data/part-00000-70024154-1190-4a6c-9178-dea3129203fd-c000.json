This paper considers undirected temporal graphs defined over\\nL time steps and connected at each time step. We study the Shortest Temporal\\nExploration Problem (STEXP) that, given all the evolution of the graph, asks\\nfor a temporal walk that starts at a given vertex, moves over at most one edge\\nat each time step, visits all the vertices, takes at most L time steps and\\ntraverses the smallest number of edges. . We prove that every constantly\\nconnected temporal graph with n vertices can be explored with O(n 1.5 ) edges\\ntraversed within O(n 3.5 ) time steps. This result improves the upper bound of\\nO(n 2 ) edges for an exploration provided by the upper bound of time steps for\\nan exploration which is also O(n 2 ). Morever, we study the case where the\\ngraph has a diameter bounded by a parameter k at each time step and we prove\\nthat there exists an exploration which takes O(kn 2 ) time steps and traverses\\nO(kn) edges. Finally, the case where the underlying graph is a cycle is studied\\nand tight bounds are provided on the number of edges traversed in the\\nworst-case if L $\\\\ge$ 2n -3.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T07:42:25Z\"}"}
