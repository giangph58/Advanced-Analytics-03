{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24329v1\", \"title\": \"Linear Reweighted Regularization Algorithms for Graph Matching Problem\", \"summary\": \"The graph matching problem is a significant special case of the Quadratic\\nAssignment Problem, with extensive applications in pattern recognition,\\ncomputer vision, protein alignments and related fields. As the problem is\\nNP-hard, relaxation and regularization techniques are frequently employed to\\nimprove tractability. However, most existing regularization terms are\\nnonconvex, posing optimization challenges. In this paper, we propose a linear\\nreweighted regularizer framework for solving the relaxed graph matching\\nproblem, preserving the convexity of the formulation. By solving a sequence of\\nrelaxed problems with the linear reweighted regularization term, one can obtain\\na sparse solution that, under certain conditions, theoretically aligns with the\\noriginal graph matching problem's solution. Furthermore, we present a practical\\nversion of the algorithm by incorporating the projected gradient method. The\\nproposed framework is applied to synthetic instances, demonstrating promising\\nnumerical results.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:18:38Z\"}"}
