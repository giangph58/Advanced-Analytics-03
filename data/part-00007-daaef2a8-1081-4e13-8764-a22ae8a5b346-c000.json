Despite advancements, training\\nmachines to capture regions of interest for comprehensive scene understanding,\\nlike human perception and reasoning, remains a significant challenge. This\\nstudy introduces a novel framework, Human Attention-based Explainable Guidance\\nfor Intelligent Vehicle Systems (AEGIS). AEGIS utilizes human attention,\\nconverted from eye-tracking, to guide reinforcement learning (RL) models to\\nidentify critical regions of interest for decision-making. AEGIS uses a\\npre-trained human attention model to guide RL models to identify critical\\nregions of interest for decision-making. By collecting 1.2 million frames from\\n20 participants across six scenarios, AEGIS pre-trains a model to predict human\\nattention patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:04:52Z\"}"}
