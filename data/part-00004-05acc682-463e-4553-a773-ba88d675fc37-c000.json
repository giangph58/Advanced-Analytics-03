If\\nan unstable graph is connected, non-bipartite and any two of its distinct\\nvertices have different neighborhoods, then it is called nontrivially unstable.\\nWe establish conditions guaranteeing the instability of various graph products,\\nincluding direct products, direct product bundles, Cartesian products, strong\\nproducts, semi-strong products, and lexicographic products. Inspired by a\\ncondition for the instability of direct product bundles, we propose a new\\nsufficient condition for circulant graphs to be unstable. This condition yields\\ninfinitely many nontrivially unstable circulant graphs that do not satisfy any\\npreviously established instability conditions for circulant graphs.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:42:11Z\"}"}
