{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05751v1\", \"title\": \"InvNeRF-Seg: Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained NeRF for 3D Object Segmentation\", \"summary\": \"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted for reconstructing\\nhigh quality 3D point clouds from 2D RGB images. However, the segmentation of\\nthese reconstructed 3D scenes is more essential for downstream tasks such as\\nobject counting, size estimation, and scene understanding. While segmentation\\non raw 3D point clouds using deep learning requires labor intensive and\\ntime-consuming manual annotation, directly training NeRF on binary masks also\\nfails due to the absence of color and shading cues essential for geometry\\nlearning. We propose Invariant NeRF for Segmentation (InvNeRFSeg), a two step,\\nzero change fine tuning strategy for 3D segmentation. We first train a standard\\nNeRF on RGB images and then fine tune it using 2D segmentation masks without\\naltering either the model architecture or loss function. This approach produces\\nhigher quality, cleaner segmented point clouds directly from the refined\\nradiance field with minimal computational overhead or complexity. Field density\\nanalysis reveals consistent semantic refinement: densities of object regions\\nincrease while background densities are suppressed, ensuring clean and\\ninterpretable segmentations. We demonstrate InvNeRFSegs superior performance\\nover both SA3D and FruitNeRF on both synthetic fruit and real world soybean\\ndatasets. This approach effectively extends 2D segmentation to high quality 3D\\nsegmentation.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T07:31:01Z\"}"}
