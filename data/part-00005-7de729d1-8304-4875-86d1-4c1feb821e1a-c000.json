To address the trade-off between the risk of\\nmeasurement disturbance in thermometers with high spectral separation of\\nemission bands (due to dispersion in the surrounding medium) and the low\\nsensitivity observed in ratiometric thermometers based on Stark level\\nthermalization, we propose a thermometer based on the structural phase\\ntransition in . The use of Yb3+ ions as dopants and the changes in Stark level\\nenergies associated with the thermally induced monoclinic-to-trigonal phase\\ntransition enable the development of a thermometer with high relative\\nsensitivity, achieving at 340K for N. Additionally, as demonstrated, the\\nstructural transition alters the probability of radiative depopulation of the\\n2F5/2 state of Yb3+, allowing the development of a lifetime-based luminescence\\nthermometer. Furthermore, the phase transition temperature and consequently the\\nthermometric performance of can be modulated by varying the Yb3+ ion\\nconcentration, offering additional tunability for specific applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:32:02Z\"}"}
