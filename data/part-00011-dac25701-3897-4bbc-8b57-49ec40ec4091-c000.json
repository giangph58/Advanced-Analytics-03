This may indicate that we may find a emergent\\ntheory for constitutive relations of classical defect systems. Start with\\nthermal systems, we put up with a bootstrap method to describe classical\\ntransport. We conjecture that Landau-Khalatnikov equation could provide heat\\nconstitutive relations when taking heat flux as order parameter. We show that\\nthe corresponding effctive Lagrangian has similar form of that of Wick-rotated\\ncomplex scalar field theory at non-relativistic limit, and only in perfect\\nconducting situation that this system is a canonical ensemble. We argue that\\nour method could be generalized to other systems besides thermal ones. By\\nanalogy with ferroelectrics, we propose the thermal domain model, which is a\\nconserved current XY model. Phase transition of the thermal system is\\nqualitatively discussed in this model.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.supr-con,hep-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T13:13:14Z\"}"}
