{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06208v1\", \"title\": \"Deep Hedging with Options Using the Implied Volatility Surface\", \"summary\": \"We propose an enhanced deep hedging framework for index option portfolios,\\ngrounded in a realistic market simulator that captures the joint dynamics of\\nS&P 500 returns and the full implied volatility surface. Our approach\\nintegrates surface-informed decisions with multiple hedging instruments and\\nexplicitly accounts for transaction costs. The hedging strategy also considers\\nthe variance risk premium embedded in the hedging instruments, enabling more\\ninformed and adaptive risk management. In this setting, state-dependent\\nno-trade regions emerge naturally, improving rebalancing efficiency and hedging\\nperformance. Tested across simulated and historical data from 1996 to 2020, our\\nmethod consistently outperforms traditional delta and delta-gamma hedging,\\ndemonstrating superior adaptability and risk reduction.\", \"main_category\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"categories\": \"q-fin.RM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:51:44Z\"}"}
