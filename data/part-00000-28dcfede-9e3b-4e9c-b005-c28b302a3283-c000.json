While previous model merging methods mainly focus on merging\\nhomogeneous models with identical architecture, they meet challenges when\\ndealing with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with inherent\\nheterogeneous property, including differences in model architecture and the\\nasymmetry in the parameter space. In this work, we propose AdaMMS, a novel\\nmodel merging method tailored for heterogeneous MLLMs. Our method tackles the\\nchallenges in three steps: mapping, merging and searching. Specifically, we\\nfirst design mapping function between models to apply model merging on MLLMs\\nwith different architecture. Then we apply linear interpolation on model\\nweights to actively adapt the asymmetry in the heterogeneous MLLMs. Finally in\\nthe hyper-parameter searching step, we propose an unsupervised hyper-parameter\\nselection method for model merging. As the first model merging method capable\\nof merging heterogeneous MLLMs without labeled data, extensive experiments on\\nvarious model combinations demonstrated that AdaMMS outperforms previous model\\nmerging methods on various vision-language benchmarks.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T05:13:02Z\"}"}
