{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07695v1\", \"title\": \"Learning Higher-Order Interactions in Brain Networks via Topological\\n  Signal Processing\", \"summary\": \"Our goal in this paper is to leverage the potential of the topological signal\\nprocessing (TSP) framework for analyzing brain networks. Representing brain\\ndata as signals over simplicial complexes allows us to capture higher-order\\nrelationships within brain regions of interest (ROIs). Here, we focus on\\nlearning the underlying brain topology from observed neural signals using two\\ndistinct inference strategies. The first method relies on higher-order\\nstatistical metrics to infer multiway relationships among ROIs. The second\\nmethod jointly learns the brain topology and sparse signal representations, of\\nboth the solenoidal and harmonic components of the signals, by minimizing the\\ntotal variation along triangles and the data-fitting errors. Leveraging the\\nproperties of solenoidal and irrotational signals, and their physical\\ninterpretations, we extract functional connectivity features from brain\\ntopologies and uncover new insights into functional organization patterns. This\\nallows us to associate brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns of\\nconservative signals with well-known functional segregation and integration\\nproperties. Our findings align with recent neuroscience research, suggesting\\nthat our approach may offer a promising pathway for characterizing the\\nhigher-order brain functional connectivities.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:28:10Z\"}"}
