However,\\ncurrent datasets are limited in representing real-world, sophisticated threats\\nand concealment tactics, and existing approaches are constrained by a\\nclosed-set paradigm with predefined labels. To address these challenges, we\\nintroduce STCray, the first multimodal X-ray baggage security dataset,\\ncomprising 46,642 image-caption paired scans across 21 threat categories,\\ngenerated using an X-ray scanner for airport security. STCray is meticulously\\ndeveloped with our specialized protocol that ensures domain-aware, coherent\\ncaptions, that lead to the multi-modal instruction following data in X-ray\\nbaggage security. This allows us to train a domain-aware visual AI assistant\\nnamed STING-BEE that supports a range of vision-language tasks, including scene\\ncomprehension, referring threat localization, visual grounding, and visual\\nquestion answering (VQA), establishing novel baselines for multi-modal learning\\nin X-ray baggage security. Further, STING-BEE shows state-of-the-art\\ngeneralization in cross-domain settings. Code, data, and models are available\\nat https://divs1159.github.io/STING-BEE/.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,eess.IV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:59:12Z\"}"}
