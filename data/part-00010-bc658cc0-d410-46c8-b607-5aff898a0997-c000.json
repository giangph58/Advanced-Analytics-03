Besides merely\\ndetecting if a product is anomalous or not, it is crucial to know the distinct\\ntype of defect, such as a bent, cut, or scratch. The ability to recognize the\\n\\\"exact\\\" defect type enables automated treatments of the anomalies in modern\\nproduction lines. Current methods are limited to solely detecting whether a\\nproduct is defective or not without providing any insights on the defect type,\\nnevertheless detecting and identifying multiple defects. We propose MultiADS, a\\nzero-shot learning approach, able to perform Multi-type Anomaly Detection and\\nSegmentation. The architecture of MultiADS comprises CLIP and extra linear\\nlayers to align the visual- and textual representation in a joint feature\\nspace. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal, is the first approach to\\nperform a multi-type anomaly segmentation task in zero-shot learning. Contrary\\nto the other baselines, our approach i) generates specific anomaly masks for\\neach distinct defect type, ii) learns to distinguish defect types, and iii)\\nsimultaneously identifies multiple defect types present in an anomalous\\nproduct. Additionally, our approach outperforms zero/few-shot learning SoTA\\nmethods on image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection and segmentation tasks\\non five commonly used datasets: MVTec-AD, Visa, MPDD, MAD and Real-IAD.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T09:52:04Z\"}"}
