Here, we introduce an\\nefficient quantum process learning method specifically designed for short-time\\nHamiltonian dynamics. Our approach reconstructs an equivalent quantum circuit\\nrepresentation from measurement data of unknown Hamiltonian evolution without\\nrequiring additional assumptions and achieves polynomial sample and\\ncomputational efficiency. Our results have broad applications in various\\ndirections. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our\\nprotocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by\\ndirectly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the\\nprediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides\\na robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking\\nrealistic noisy quantum hardware. This work establishes a new theoretical\\nfoundation for practical quantum dynamics learning, paving the way for scalable\\nquantum process characterization in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum\\ncomputing.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:50:00Z\"}"}
