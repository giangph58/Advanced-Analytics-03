{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01645v1\", \"title\": \"How to write competitive proposals and job applications\", \"summary\": \"Writing proposals and job applications is arguably one of the most important\\ntasks in the career of a scientist. The proposed ideas must be scientifically\\ncompelling, but how a proposal is planned, written, and presented can make an\\nenormous difference. This Perspective is the third in a series aimed at\\ntraining the writing skills of professional astronomers. In the first two\\npapers we concentrated on the writing of papers, here we concentrate on how\\nproposals and job applications can be optimally written and presented. We\\ndiscuss how to select where to propose or apply, how to optimise your writing,\\nand add notes on the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. This guide\\nis aimed primarily at more junior researchers, but we hope that our\\nobservations and suggestions may also be helpful for more experienced\\napplicants, as well as for reviewers and funding agencies.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM,physics.ed-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T11:53:45Z\"}"}
