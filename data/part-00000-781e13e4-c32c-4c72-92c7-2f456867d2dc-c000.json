Our predictions reach\\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy in resummed\\nperturbation theory, matched to $O(\\\\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order QCD calculations\\nobtained using the program NLOJet++. We include a rigorous treatment of\\nhadronization corrections, which are universal across different event shapes\\nand kinematic variables $x$ and $Q$ at leading power, and supplement them with\\na systematic scheme to remove $O(\\\\Lambda_\\\\textrm{QCD})$ renormalon ambiguities\\nin their definition. The framework of SCET allows us to connect smoothly the\\nnonperturbative, resummation, and fixed-order regions, whose relative\\nimportance varies with $x$ and $Q$, and to rigorously estimate theoretical\\nuncertainties, across a broad range of $x$ and $Q$ covering existing\\nexperimental results from HERA as well as expected new measurements from the\\nupcoming Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC). Our predictions will serve as an\\nimportant benchmark for the EIC program, enabling the precise determination of\\nthe QCD strong coupling $\\\\alpha_s$ and the universal nonperturbative first\\nmoment parameter $\\\\Omega_1$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:19:36Z\"}"}
