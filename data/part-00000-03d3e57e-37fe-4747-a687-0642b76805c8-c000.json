Such reactions can occur for\\nexample upon double ionization of small organic molecules, and have recently\\nsparked much scientific interest. We have studied the dynamics of the\\nH$_2$-roaming reaction leading to the formation of H$_3^+$ after two-photon\\ndouble ionization of ethanol and 2-aminoethanol, using an XUV-UV pump-probe\\nscheme. For ethanol, we find dynamics similar to previous studies employing\\ndifferent pump-probe schemes, indicating the independence of the observed\\ndynamics from the method of ionization and the photon energy of the disruptive\\nprobe pulse. Surprisingly, we do not observe a kinetic isotope effect in\\nethanol-D$_6$, in contrast to previous experiments on methanol where such an\\neffect was observed. This distinction indicates fundamental differences in the\\nenergetics of the reaction pathways as compared to the methanol molecule. The\\nlarger number of possible roaming pathways compared to methanol complicates the\\nanalysis considerably. In contrast to previous studies, we additionally analyze\\na broad range of dissociative ionization products, which feature distinct\\ndynamics from that of H$_{3}^{+}$ and allow initial insight into the action of\\nthe disruptive UV-probe pulse.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T12:46:24Z\"}"}
