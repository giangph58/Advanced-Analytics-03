Therefore, various\\ntechniques are deployed to diagnose and mitigate them. However, these\\ntechniques are costly and time-consuming, particularly in iterative design and\\ndevelopment. A substantial body of research indicates that automation and\\nartificial intelligence can enhance the process of obtaining usability\\ninsights. In our systematic review of 155 publications, we offer a\\ncomprehensive overview of the current state of the art for automated usability\\nissue detection. We analyze trends, paradigms, and the technical context in\\nwhich they are applied. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential\\ndirections for future research.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.SE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T07:07:32Z\"}"}
