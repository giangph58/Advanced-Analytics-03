Our approach combines next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) two- and\\nthree-body chiral interactions with one- and two-body axial current operators,\\nall consistently derived in chiral effective field theory. Low-energy constants\\nare determined exclusively from nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and\\nfew-body observables for systems with $A \\\\leq 3$. Using these interactions and\\ntransition operators, we perform two-channel Monte Carlo simulations to compute\\nthe $\\\\beta$-decay matrix element for $^6$He, obtaining results in reasonable\\nagreement with experimental measurements. To address the Monte Carlo sign\\nproblem, we implement a perturbative expansion around a leading-order\\nHamiltonian with approximate Wigner-SU(4) symmetry. This systematic approach\\nprovides a foundation for extending NLEFT simulations to precision studies of\\nweak processes in medium-mass nuclei.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th,hep-lat\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:38:07Z\"}"}
