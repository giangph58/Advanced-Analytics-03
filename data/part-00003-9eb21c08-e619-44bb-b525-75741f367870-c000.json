By capturing Riemannian geometric\\nstructures inherent in such privacy challenges, we refine the concept of\\ndifferential privacy through the introduction of an initial state adjacency set\\nbased on Riemannian distances. A new differential privacy condition is\\nformulated using incremental output boundedness, enabling the design of\\ntime-varying Laplacian noise to achieve specified privacy guarantees. The\\nproposed framework extends beyond initial state protection to also cover system\\nparameter privacy, which is demonstrated as a special application.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:42:18Z\"}"}
