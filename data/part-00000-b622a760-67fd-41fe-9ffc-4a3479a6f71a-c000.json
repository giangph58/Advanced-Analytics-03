Critical services operate under\\nhard real-time constraints, which Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) complements\\non the in-vehicle Ethernet layer. TSN ensures deterministic communication\\nbetween critical services and its Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) supports dynamic\\nresource reservations. However, the dynamic nature of service deployment\\nchallenges network resource configuration, since any new reservation may change\\nthe latency of already validated flows. In addition, standard methods of\\nworst-case latency analysis for CBS have been found incorrect, and current TSN\\nstream reservation procedures lack mechanisms to signal application layer\\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) requirements or verify deadlines. In this paper, we\\npropose a QoS negotiation scheme within the automotive SOA that interacts with\\nthe TSN network controller to reserve resources while ensuring latency bounds.\\nWe comparatively evaluate reservation schemes using worst-case analysis and\\nsimulations of a realistic In-Vehicle Network (IVN) for demonstrating their\\nimpact on QoS guarantees, resource utilization, and setup times. We find that\\nonly a reservation scheme utilizing per-queue delay budgets and network\\ncalculus provides valid configurations and guarantees acceptable latency bounds\\nthroughout the IVN. The proposed service negotiation mechanism efficiently\\nestablishes 450 vehicular network reservations in just 11ms.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.NI\", \"categories\": \"cs.NI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T08:22:32Z\"}"}
