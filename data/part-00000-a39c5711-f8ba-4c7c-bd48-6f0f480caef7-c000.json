{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05818v1\", \"title\": \"Proper constituent gluon mass as the final piece to construct hybrid\", \"summary\": \"After treating hybrid as a three-body system, we recalculate the spectra and\\ndecay widths of the $1^{-+}$ light hybrids via the Gauss Expansion Method\\n(GEM). Our result shows that, after adding into only one more parameter\\n$m_g$=450 MeV, i.e., the constituent gluon mass, we can reproduce nearly all\\nthe results in our previous work by just using the model parameters from meson\\nspectra calculation, which shows the unification of Quantum Chromodynamics\\n(QCD). As a result, $\\\\pi_1(1600)$ and $\\\\eta_1(1855)$ may not be explained as\\n$1^{-+}$ hybrids simultaneously, and the $\\\\eta_1(1855)$ observed by BESIII may\\nnot be a hybrid. In addition, we predict an existence of a hybrid\\n$\\\\eta_1(1640)$, which can be verified by searching the $a_1(1260)\\\\pi$ channel.\\nFurthermore, to search for an isospin-0 and an isospin-$\\\\frac{1}{2}$ hybrid,\\nthe golden channels may be $K_1(1270)\\\\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1270)\\\\pi$, respectively.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:01:14Z\"}"}
