{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07823v1\", \"title\": \"A new look into the atmospheric composition of WASP-39 b\", \"summary\": \"Being one of the first exoplanets observed by the James Webb Space Telescope\\n(JWST), WASP-39 b has become an iconic target and many transit spectra recorded\\nwith different instruments (NIRISS, NIRCAM, NIRSpec G395H, NIRSpec PRISM and\\nMIRI) are currently available, allowing in-depth studies of its atmosphere. We\\npresent here a novel approach to interpret WASP-39 b's transit spectroscopic\\ndata, consisting of a multi-step process where ab initio equilibrium chemistry\\nmodels and blind retrievals are used iteratively to find physically robust,\\noptimal solutions. Following this approach, we have identified a new scenario\\nto explain WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, in which silicon-based\\nchemistry plays a major role. In this scenario, SiO may explain the spectral\\nabsorption at 4.1 $\\\\mu$m, currently interpreted as being due to SO$_2$. SiO and\\nthe other gas species identified by the retrieval models, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$,\\nNa and K, are consistent with an atmosphere in chemical equilibrium with a\\ntemperature-pressure profile constrained by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption bands.\\nIn addition, silicate clouds and hazes can produce the spectral features\\nobserved by MIRI in the spectral window 5-12 $\\\\mu$m. While we advocate the need\\nfor more data, possibly at higher spectral resolution, to confirm our results\\nfor WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, we highlight a refined atmospheric\\nretrieval strategy with pre-selection and post-reconstruction to guide the next\\ngeneration of transit spectroscopy.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.EP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T15:01:28Z\"}"}
