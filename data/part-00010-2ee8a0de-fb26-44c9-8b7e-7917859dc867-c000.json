We\\nrevisit the operators that break $C$ and $CP$ for flavor-conserving transitions\\nin both the Standard Model effective field theory and the low-energy effective\\nfield theory, which subsequently can be matched to light-meson physics using\\nchiral perturbation theory. As applications, we discuss in particular the\\n$C$-odd Dalitz plot asymmetries in $\\\\eta\\\\to3\\\\pi$, but also decays with dilepton\\npairs in the final state, such as long-distance contributions to the rare\\nsemileptonic decays $\\\\eta\\\\to\\\\pi^0\\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-$ as well as asymmetries in\\n$\\\\eta^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\to \\\\gamma \\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-$ and $\\\\eta^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\to\\n\\\\pi^+\\\\pi^-\\\\ell^+\\\\ell^-$.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T08:07:32Z\"}"}
