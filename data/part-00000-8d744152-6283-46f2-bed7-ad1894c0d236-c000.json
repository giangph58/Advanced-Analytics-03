{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07955v1\", \"title\": \"BoxDreamer: Dreaming Box Corners for Generalizable Object Pose\\n  Estimation\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a generalizable RGB-based approach for object pose\\nestimation, specifically designed to address challenges in sparse-view\\nsettings. While existing methods can estimate the poses of unseen objects,\\ntheir generalization ability remains limited in scenarios involving occlusions\\nand sparse reference views, restricting their real-world applicability. To\\novercome these limitations, we introduce corner points of the object bounding\\nbox as an intermediate representation of the object pose. The 3D object corners\\ncan be reliably recovered from sparse input views, while the 2D corner points\\nin the target view are estimated through a novel reference-based point\\nsynthesizer, which works well even in scenarios involving occlusions. As object\\nsemantic points, object corners naturally establish 2D-3D correspondences for\\nobject pose estimation with a PnP algorithm. Extensive experiments on the\\nYCB-Video and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets show that our approach outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed\\nrepresentation and significantly enhancing the generalization capabilities of\\nobject pose estimation, which is crucial for real-world applications.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:58:35Z\"}"}
