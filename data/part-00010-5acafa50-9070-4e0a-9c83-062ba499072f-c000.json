Physical solutions confined in the domain between\\nthe event horizon and a pole satisfy a boundary value problem, although with\\nboundary conditions which are different from standard quasi-normal modes. We\\nrefer to them as \\\"trapped quasi-normal modes\\\". Focusing on a Schwarzschild\\nblack hole in Einstein-Proca theory, we find that trapped quasi-normal modes\\naccurately capture the behavior of perturbations under time evolution. In\\nparticular, axial-vector modes are unstable, with a growth rate that increases\\nwith multipole number. More interestingly, we uncover a new instability that\\naffects monopole perturbations. These results confirm the existence of a novel\\ndestabilization mechanism of black holes by non-minimally coupled vector\\nfields, with potential implications to well-studied models of modified gravity\\nand cosmology based on vector particles.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:14:36Z\"}"}
