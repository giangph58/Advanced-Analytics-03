We present FaceCloak, a neural network framework that\\nprotects face templates by generating smart, renewable binary cloaks. Our\\nmethod proactively thwarts inversion attacks by cloaking face templates with\\nunique disruptors synthesized from a single face template on the fly while\\nprovably retaining biometric utility and unlinkability. Our cloaked templates\\ncan suppress sensitive attributes while generalizing to novel feature\\nextraction schemes and outperforms leading baselines in terms of biometric\\nmatching and resiliency to reconstruction attacks. FaceCloak-based matching is\\nextremely fast (inference time cost=0.28ms) and light-weight (0.57MB).\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:23:21Z\"}"}
