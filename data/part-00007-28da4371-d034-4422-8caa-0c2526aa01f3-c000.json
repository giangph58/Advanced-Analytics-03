The quest for physics beyond the Standard Model is in\\nfact strongly related to a reliable determination of systematic uncertainties,\\namong which the theoretical ones have nowadays become a significant component.\\nIn particular, an important role is played by the universal Parton Distribution\\nFunctions (PDFs). This thesis presents a collection of studies aimed at\\nimproving the accuracy and precision of collinear PDF determinations. By\\nemploying the NNPDF methodology, we present recent polarized and unpolarized\\nPDF fits including higher order QCD corrections and theoretical uncertainties.\\nAdditionally, we examine the presence of non-vanishing intrinsic charm and its\\nphenomenological implications.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T09:02:05Z\"}"}
