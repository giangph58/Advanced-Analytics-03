It substitutes the original measurement\\nmodel by another one containing an auxiliary variance dilation parameter that\\ndisguises corrupted radio links into ones with large noise variances. This\\nallows for relaxing the non-convex maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) into a\\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) problem by applying convex-concave programming\\n(CCP) procedure. The proposed SDP solution simultaneously outputs target\\nlocation and attacker detection estimates, eliminating the need for further\\napplication of sophisticated detectors. Numerical results corroborate excellent\\nperformance of the proposed method in terms of localization accuracy and show\\nthat its detection rates are highly competitive with the state of the art.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:40:08Z\"}"}
