{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07946v1\", \"title\": \"Characteristic function-based tests for spatial randomness\", \"summary\": \"We introduce a new type of test for complete spatial randomness that applies\\nto mapped point patterns in a rectangle or a cube of any dimension. This is the\\nfirst test of its kind to be based on characteristic functions and utilizes a\\nweighted L2-distance between the empirical and uniform characteristic\\nfunctions. It is simple to calculate and does not require adjusting for edge\\neffects. An efficient algorithm is developed to find the asymptotic null\\ndistribution of the test statistic under the Cauchy weight function. In a\\nsimulation, our test shows varying sensitivity to different levels of spatial\\ninteraction depending on the scale parameter of the Cauchy weight function.\\nTests with different parameter values can be combined to create a\\nBonferroni-corrected omnibus test, which is almost always more powerful than\\nthe popular L-test and the Clark-Evans test for detecting heterogeneous and\\naggregated alternatives, although less powerful than the L-test for detecting\\nregular alternatives. The simplicity of empirical characteristic function makes\\nit straightforward to extend our test to non-rectangular or sparsely sampled\\npoint patterns.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,stat.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T17:54:11Z\"}"}
