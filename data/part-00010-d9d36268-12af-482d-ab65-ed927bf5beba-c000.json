The notions of anti-O-operators on\\nNovikov algebras are developed to interpret anti-pre-Novikov algebras.\\nSecondly, we introduce the notion of anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as the\\nbialgebra structures corresponding to a double constructions of symmetric\\nquasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras, which are interpreted in terms of certain\\nmatched pairs of Novikov algebras as well as the compatible anti-pre-Novikov\\nalgebras. The study of coboundary cases leads to the introduction of the the\\nanti-pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation (APN-YBE), whose skew-symmetric solutions\\ngive coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The notion of O-operators on\\nanti-pre-Novikov algebras is studied to construct skew-symmetric solutions of\\nthe APN-YBE.\", \"main_category\": \"math.RA\", \"categories\": \"math.RA,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T04:10:38Z\"}"}
