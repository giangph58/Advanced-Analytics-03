We express these sequences within the framework of generalized\\nlocally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix\\nsequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the asymptotic\\nsingular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences,\\nthe asymptotic spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of\\nreal symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems\\nand determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study\\nconcludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical\\nfindings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:58:31Z\"}"}
