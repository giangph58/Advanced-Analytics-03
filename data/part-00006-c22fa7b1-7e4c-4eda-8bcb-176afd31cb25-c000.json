Going back\\nto the original motivations, by which the transport is a bilinear function of a\\nmass distribution (without loss of generality a probability density) and a\\ntransport plan (a stochastic kernel), we explore the quantum version where the\\nmass distribution is generalised to a density matrix, and the transport plan to\\na completely positive and trace preserving map.\\n  These two data are naturally integrated into their Jordan product, which is\\ncalled state over time (``stote''), and the transport cost is postulated to be\\na linear function of it.\\n  We explore the properties of this transport cost, as well as the optimal\\ntransport cost between two given states (simply the minimum cost over all\\nsuitable transport plans). After that, we analyse in considerable detail the\\ncase of unitary invariant cost, for which we can calculate many costs\\nanalytically. These findings suggest that our quantum transport cost is\\nqualitatively different from Monge's classical transport.\", \"main_category\": \"quant-ph\", \"categories\": \"quant-ph,math-ph,math.MP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T09:13:56Z\"}"}
