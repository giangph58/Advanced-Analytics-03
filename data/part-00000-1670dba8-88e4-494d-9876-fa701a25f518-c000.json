A\\n  time series regression analysis\", \"summary\": \"The release of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and\\nCopilot is changing the way text is created and may influence the content that\\nwe find on the web. This study investigated whether the release of these two\\npopular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on\\nworldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a\\ndataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was\\napplied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any\\nstatistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT\\nand/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have\\nany significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total\\nof 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot\\nalthough significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3,\\nGopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these\\nlanguage models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news\\nheadlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.SI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T07:44:26Z\"}"}
