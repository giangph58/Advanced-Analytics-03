{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822v1\", \"title\": \"How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time\", \"summary\": \"We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave\\npropagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across\\nthe piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths\\n($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a\\ncertain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each\\nindividual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of\\ntransmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique\\nis combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in\\nfrequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the\\nfinite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their\\nassociated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths\\nto find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this\\n``path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix\\nnumerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling\\nsubstantial computational savings.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.geo-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.geo-ph,cond-mat.other\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T08:22:38Z\"}"}
