{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01900v1\", \"title\": \"Physical Modeling of Saturated Common Mode Choke\", \"summary\": \"Common mode chokes (CMCs) are conventional circuit elements performing\\nseveral tasks, including noise suppression, hindering electromagnetic\\ninterference, providing signal integrity, and circuit protection. Much as they\\nare widely used, their fundamental construction and description are often\\nqualitative and lack an understanding of the underlying physical principles. We\\ndiscuss the behavior of a commercial CMC based on the physical description of\\nthe superparamagnetic core and parasitic circuit elements. The results are\\nvalidated using a DC bias current and an external magnetic field, which affect\\nthe magnetic properties. The behavior of the CMCs in the strongly non-linear\\nregime is also described.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.app-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T16:58:47Z\"}"}
