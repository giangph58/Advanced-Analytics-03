To investigate their\\nobservational signatures, we developed a 1D Monte Carlo radiation transport\\ncode and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the\\ndecay chain $\\\\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\\\\to\\\\mathrm{^{56}Co}\\\\to\\\\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find\\nthat key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\\\\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in\\nthe $130M_\\\\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by\\nnext-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the\\n$100M_\\\\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the\\ntemplate for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical\\npredictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within\\n300 Mpc to be approximately 0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but\\nalso emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations\\nover the decade.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.HE\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.SR\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:52:43Z\"}"}
