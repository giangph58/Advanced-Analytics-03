Assuming the real-valued potential $ V $\\nexhibits sufficient decay and regularity, we prove that for all dimensions $ n\\n\\\\geq 5 $, the wave operators $ W_{\\\\pm}(H, H_0)$ are bounded on\\n$L^{p}(\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}) $ for all $ 1 \\\\leq p \\\\leq \\\\infty $, provided that zero\\nis a regular threshold of $H $.\\n  As applications, we derive the sharp $L^p$-$L^{p'}$ dispersive estimates for\\nSchr\\\\\\\"odinger group $e^{-itH}$, as well as for the solutions operators $\\\\cos(t\\n\\\\sqrt{H})$ and $\\\\frac{\\\\sin (t \\\\sqrt{H})}{ \\\\sqrt{H}}$ associated with the\\nfollowing beam equations with potentials: $$\\n  \\\\partial_t^2 u + \\\\left(\\\\Delta^2 -\\\\Delta+ V(x) \\\\right) u = 0, \\\\ \\\\\\n  u(0, x) = f(x), \\\\quad \\\\partial_t u(0, x) = g(x),\\\\ \\\\ (t, x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\n\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^n,\\\\ n\\\\geq5, $$\\n  where $p'$ denotes the H\\\\\\\"older conjugate of $p$, with $1 \\\\leq p \\\\leq 2$.\\nMoreover, we remark that the same results hold for the operator $ \\\\epsilon\\n\\\\Delta^2 - \\\\Delta + V$ with a parameter $\\\\epsilon>0,$ providing greater\\nflexibility for the analysis of related equations.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AP\", \"categories\": \"math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T03:28:06Z\"}"}
