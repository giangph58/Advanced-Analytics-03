In this paper, we provide a\\ncomprehensive description of biochemical networks by considering individual\\natoms and chemical bonds. To address combinatorial complexity, we introduce a\\nwell-established approach to group similar types of information within\\nbiochemical networks. A conserved moiety is a set of atoms whose association is\\ninvariant across all reactions in a network. A reacting moiety is a set of\\nbonds that are either broken, formed, or undergo a change in bond order in at\\nleast one reaction in the network. By mathematically identifying these\\nmoieties, we establish the biological significance of conserved and reacting\\nmoieties according to the mathematical properties of the stoichiometric matrix.\\nWe also present a novel decomposition of the stoichiometric matrix based on\\nconserved moieties. This approach bridges the gap between graph theory, linear\\nalgebra, and biological interpretation, thus opening up new horizons in the\\nstudy of chemical reaction networks.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.MN\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T13:54:47Z\"}"}
