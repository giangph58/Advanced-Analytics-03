In this work, we examine the role of synthetic\\ndata as opposed to that of real experimental data for scientific research. Our\\nanalyses indicate that nearly three-quarters of experimental datasets available\\non open-access platforms have relatively low adoption rates, opening new\\nopportunities to enhance their discoverability and usability by automated\\nmethods. Additionally, we observe an increasing difficulty in distinguishing\\nsynthetic from real experimental data. We propose supplementing ongoing efforts\\nin automating synthetic data detection by increasing the focus on watermarking\\nreal experimental data, thereby strengthening data traceability and integrity.\\nOur estimates suggest that watermarking even less than half of the real world\\ndata generated annually could help sustain model robustness, while promoting a\\nbalanced integration of synthetic and human-generated content.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:07:52Z\"}"}
