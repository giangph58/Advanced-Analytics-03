However, results to date have been\\nlimited, and few social scientists have adopted these methods. In this position\\npaper, we argue that the promise of LLM social simulations can be achieved by\\naddressing five tractable challenges. We ground our argument in a literature\\nsurvey of empirical comparisons between LLMs and human research subjects,\\ncommentaries on the topic, and related work. We identify promising directions\\nwith prompting, fine-tuning, and complementary methods. We believe that LLM\\nsocial simulations can already be used for exploratory research, such as pilot\\nexperiments for psychology, economics, sociology, and marketing. More\\nwidespread use may soon be possible with rapidly advancing LLM capabilities,\\nand researchers should prioritize developing conceptual models and evaluations\\nthat can be iteratively deployed and refined at pace with ongoing AI advances.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.HC\", \"categories\": \"cs.HC,cs.AI,cs.CL,cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:01:26Z\"}"}
