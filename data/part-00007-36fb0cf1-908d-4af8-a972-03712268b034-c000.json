{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06671v1\", \"title\": \"Defects in Silicon Carbide as Quantum Qubits: Recent Advances in Defect\\n  Engineering\", \"summary\": \"This review provides an overview of defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with\\npotential applications as quantum qubits. It begins with a brief introduction\\nto quantum qubits and existing qubit platforms, outlining the essential\\ncriteria a defect must meet to function as a viable qubit. The focus then\\nshifts to the most promising defects in SiC, notably the silicon vacancy (VSi)\\nand divacancy (VC-VSi). A key challenge in utilizing these defects for quantum\\napplications is their precise and controllable creation. Various fabrication\\ntechniques, including irradiation, ion implantation, femtosecond laser\\nprocessing, and focused ion beam methods, have been explored to create these\\ndefects. Designed as a beginner-friendly resource, this review aims to support\\nearly-career experimental researchers entering the field of SiC-related quantum\\nqubits. Providing an introduction to defect-based qubits in SiC offers valuable\\ninsights into fabrication strategies, recent progress, and the challenges that\\nlie ahead.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T08:13:58Z\"}"}
