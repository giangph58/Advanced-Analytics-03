We show that there is a matrix norm on the dual space $S^*$, under\\nwhich, and the usual dual matrix cone, $S^*$ becomes a dual operator system\\nwith a generating cone, denoted by $S^\\\\rd$. The canonical complete order\\nisomorphism $\\\\iota_{S^*}: S^* \\\\to S^\\\\rd$ is a dual Banach space isomorphism.\\nFurthermore, we construct a canonical completely contractive\\nweak$^*$-homeomorphism $\\\\beta_S: (S^\\\\rd)^\\\\rd\\\\to S^{**}$, and verify that it is\\na complete order isomorphism.\\n  For a complete operator system $T$ with a generating cone and a completely\\npositive complete contraction $\\\\varphi:S\\\\to T$, there is a weak$^*$-continuous\\ncompletely positive complete contraction $\\\\varphi^\\\\rd:T^\\\\rd \\\\to S^\\\\rd$ with\\n$\\\\iota_{S^*}\\\\circ \\\\varphi^* = \\\\varphi^\\\\rd \\\\circ \\\\iota_{T^*}$. This produces a\\nfaithful functor from the category of complete operator systems with generating\\ncones (where morphisms are completely positive complete contractions) to the\\ncategory of dual operator systems with generating cones (where morphisms are\\nweak$^*$-continuous completely positive complete contractions).\\n  We define the notion of approximately unital operator systems, and verify\\nthat operator systems considered in \\\\cite{CvS} and \\\\cite{CvS2} are\\napproximately unital. If $S$ is approximately unital, then $\\\\iota_{S^*}:S^* \\\\to\\nS^\\\\rd$ is an operator space isomorphism and $\\\\beta_S: (S^\\\\rd)^\\\\rd\\\\to S^{**}$ is\\na complete isometry. We will also establish that the restriction of the\\nfaithful functor $(S,T,\\\\varphi)\\\\mapsto (T^\\\\rd, S^\\\\rd, \\\\varphi^\\\\rd)$ to the\\ncategory of approximately unital complete operator systems is both full and\\ninjective on objects.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OA\", \"categories\": \"math.OA,math.FA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T06:50:46Z\"}"}
