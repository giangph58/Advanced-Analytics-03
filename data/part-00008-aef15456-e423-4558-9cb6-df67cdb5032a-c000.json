{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07093v1\", \"title\": \"FlashDepth: Real-time Streaming Video Depth Estimation at 2K Resolution\", \"summary\": \"A versatile video depth estimation model should (1) be accurate and\\nconsistent across frames, (2) produce high-resolution depth maps, and (3)\\nsupport real-time streaming. We propose FlashDepth, a method that satisfies all\\nthree requirements, performing depth estimation on a 2044x1148 streaming video\\nat 24 FPS. We show that, with careful modifications to pretrained single-image\\ndepth models, these capabilities are enabled with relatively little data and\\ntraining. We evaluate our approach across multiple unseen datasets against\\nstate-of-the-art depth models, and find that ours outperforms them in terms of\\nboundary sharpness and speed by a significant margin, while maintaining\\ncompetitive accuracy. We hope our model will enable various applications that\\nrequire high-resolution depth, such as video editing, and online\\ndecision-making, such as robotics.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T17:59:31Z\"}"}
