In this work, we show that the universality of KNO scaling can be\\nextended to hadron-hadron collisions when restricted to QCD jets. We present a\\ncomprehensive study of KNO scaling in QCD jets produced in proton-proton\\ncollisions at the LHC. Using perturbative QCD calculations in the double\\nlogarithmic approximation and PYTHIA simulations, we find that KNO scaling\\napproximately holds for both quark and gluon jets across a broad jet $p_T$\\nrange, from $0.1$ TeV to $2.5$ TeV, at both the parton and hadron levels.\\nEspecially, we highlight characteristic differences between the KNO scaling\\nfunctions of quark and gluon jets, with the quark-jet scaling function lying\\nabove that of gluon jets at both low and high multiplicities. This distinction\\nis essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC. Furthermore, we\\npropose direct experimental tests of KNO scaling in QCD jets at the LHC through\\nquark-gluon discrimination using jet substructure techniques, as demonstrated\\nby applying energy correlation functions to PYTHIA-generated data.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ph\", \"categories\": \"hep-ph,hep-ex,nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:18:24Z\"}"}
