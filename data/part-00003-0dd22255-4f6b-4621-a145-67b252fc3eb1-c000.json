{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06950v1\", \"title\": \"PathSegDiff: Pathology Segmentation using Diffusion model\\n  representations\", \"summary\": \"Image segmentation is crucial in many computational pathology pipelines,\\nincluding accurate disease diagnosis, subtyping, outcome, and survivability\\nprediction. The common approach for training a segmentation model relies on a\\npre-trained feature extractor and a dataset of paired image and mask\\nannotations. These are used to train a lightweight prediction model that\\ntranslates features into per-pixel classes. The choice of the feature extractor\\nis central to the performance of the final segmentation model, and recent\\nliterature has focused on finding tasks to pre-train the feature extractor. In\\nthis paper, we propose PathSegDiff, a novel approach for histopathology image\\nsegmentation that leverages Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) as pre-trained\\nfeatured extractors. Our method utilizes a pathology-specific LDM, guided by a\\nself-supervised encoder, to extract rich semantic information from H\\\\&E stained\\nhistopathology images. We employ a simple, fully convolutional network to\\nprocess the features extracted from the LDM and generate segmentation masks.\\nOur experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods\\non the BCSS and GlaS datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of\\ndomain-specific diffusion pre-training in capturing intricate tissue structures\\nand enhancing segmentation accuracy in histopathology images.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T14:58:21Z\"}"}
