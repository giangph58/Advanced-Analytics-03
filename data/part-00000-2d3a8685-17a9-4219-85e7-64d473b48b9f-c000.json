{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23834v1\", \"title\": \"$q$-deformed rationals and irrationals\", \"summary\": \"The concept of $q$-deformation, or ``$q$-analogue'' arises in many areas of\\nmathematics. In algebra and representation theory, it is the origin of quantum\\ngroups; $q$-deformations are important for knot invariants, combinatorial\\nenumeration, discrete geometry, analysis, and many other parts of mathematics.\\nIn mathematical physics, $q$-deformations are often understood as\\n``quantizations''.\\n  The recently introduced notion of a $q$-deformed real number is based on the\\ngeometric idea of invariance by a modular group action. The goal of this\\nlecture is to explain what is a $q$-rational and a $q$-irrational, demonstrate\\nbeautiful properties of these objects, and describe their relations to many\\ndifferent areas. We also tried to describe some applications of $q$-numbers.\", \"main_category\": \"math.CO\", \"categories\": \"math.CO,math.QA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:28:41Z\"}"}
