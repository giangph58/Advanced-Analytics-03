We consider classical detection schemes\\nthat rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor, and modeling of the source as\\na function of unknown parameters. As the usual spherical harmonic decomposition\\nof the anomaly has to be truncated in practice, we study the signal vector\\nsubspaces induced by each multipole of the decomposition, proving they are not\\nin direct sum, and discussing the impact it has on the choice of the truncation\\norder. Further, to ease the detection strategy based on generalized likelihood\\nratio test, we rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical\\nset of orthonormal functions (multipolar orthonormal basis functions) that\\nspans the space of the noise-free measured signal. Finally, based on the\\nsubspace structure of the multipole vector spaces, we study the impact of the\\ntruncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential\\nsurparametrization, and the behaviour of the information criteria used to\\nchoose this order.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP,math-ph,math.MP,stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:00:24Z\"}"}
