However, its\\ninterpretation can be complex, as it does not align with commonly taught\\nconcepts in medical statistics. Consequently, the Brier score is often\\nmisinterpreted, sometimes to a significant extent, a fact that has not been\\nadequately addressed in the literature. This commentary aims to explore\\nprevalent misconceptions surrounding the Brier score and elucidate the reasons\\nthese interpretations are incorrect.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.AP\", \"categories\": \"stat.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T10:30:44Z\"}"}
