Accompanying the superconductivity and a\\ncorrelated insulator phase is the Kondo-lattice-like phenomenology in transport\\nproperties. Here we consider how such phenomenology can develop when the\\ncombination of the active bands are topological. We advance a unique\\nconstruction of compact molecular orbitals through a partial Wannierization\\nthat is symmetry preserving. The resulting Anderson lattice model provides the\\nbasis for a microscopic understanding of the experimental observation,\\nincluding the involved energy scales. Our approach may apply to a broad range\\nof settings where topology and correlations interplay.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:59:08Z\"}"}
