This provides a global parabolic gauge for\\nthe Ricci flow and implies the uniqueness of the tangent flow without modulo\\nany diffeomorphisms.\\n  We present two main applications: First, we construct and classify all\\nancient Ricci flows asymptotic to any compact integrable shrinker, showing that\\nthey converge exponentially. Second, we obtain the optimal convergence rate at\\nsingularities modelled on the shrinker, characterized by the first negative\\neigenvalue of the stability operator for the entropy. In particular, we show\\nthat any Ricci flow developing a round $\\\\mathbb S^n$ singularity converges at\\nleast at the rate $(-t)^{\\\\frac{n+1}{n-1}}$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.DG\", \"categories\": \"math.DG,math.AP\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T17:50:14Z\"}"}
