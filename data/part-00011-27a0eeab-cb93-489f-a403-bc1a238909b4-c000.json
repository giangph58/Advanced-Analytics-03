In this work, we propose a topological laser based on\\ntwo-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattices as induced by artificial\\ngauge flux insertion. The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier\\ncycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable\\nfrequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps.\\nThese topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each\\nphotonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability\\nin frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous\\ntopological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial\\ngauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge\\nflux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger\\nsingle-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge\\nflux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders.\\nWe also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux\\ngovern the photon dynamics in various regimes. These results provide crucial\\ntheoretical insights for OAM control in topological lasers and pave the way for\\nadvancements in high precision engineering of lasers and optical systems.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,quant-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:45:25Z\"}"}
