{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24093v1\", \"title\": \"Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Circuit Modeling and\\n  Reflection Amplification Optimization\", \"summary\": \"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) constitute a promising emerging\\ntechnology that enables wireless systems to control the propagation environment\\nto enhance diverse communication objectives. To mitigate double-fading\\nattenuation in RIS-aided links, the paradigm of active metamaterials capable of\\namplifying their incident wave has emerged. In this paper, capitalizing on the\\ninherent negative-resistance region of tunnel diodes, we propose their\\nintegration into each RIS unit element to enable RISs with reflection\\namplification entirely in the analog domain. We derive novel realistic\\nphase-amplitude relationships and power constraints specific to this model,\\naddressing gaps in the existing literature where amplitude limits are often\\nchosen arbitrarily. This characterization of our active RIS unit elements is\\nincorporated into two novel optimization frameworks targeting the spectral\\nefficiency maximization of RIS-assisted Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO)\\nsystems, which are solved via an one-step approach and an iterative Alternating\\nOptimization (AO) method. The former approach is used to initialize the AO\\nframework, enhancing both its performance and convergence. Our numerical\\ninvestigations emphasize the importance of accurately modeling phase-amplitude\\ndependencies, and provide key insights into the impact of RIS-induced noise as\\nwell as the trade-off between available power and the number of active\\nelements.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SP\", \"categories\": \"eess.SP\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T13:44:03Z\"}"}
