The core of our method builds on a given\\nCooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithm and exploits sensor\\nredundancy to construct equivalent controllers, each driven by a distinct,\\nnon-overlapping subset of sensors (equivalent controller realizations). By\\nconstruction, these controller realizations generate the same control input in\\nthe absence of an attack, allowing us to devise an algorithm that compares\\ncontrol signals and measurements to pinpoint anomalous behavior via a majority\\nvote. This allows us to: 1) decide in real-time which subset of sensors is\\ncompromised; and 2) switch to a healthy subset, mitigating thus sensor FDI\\nattacks. We model the latter logic as a hybrid dynamic controller that decides\\nin real-time what realization to use, builds on attack-dependent flow and jump\\nsets, and employs controller resets (to return the state of previously\\ncompromised controller realizations to a correct value after the attack stops).\\nWe demonstrate the performance of our scheme through simulation experiments.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.SY\", \"categories\": \"eess.SY,cs.SY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:11:57Z\"}"}
