The model also describes an imperfect and waning vaccination. Global\\nstability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved when the basic reproduction\\nnumber is less than one. It is also proved that there are bistable situations,\\nwhere when the vaccination reproduction number is less than one, there are two\\nendemic equilibria, although it is shown numerically that the region where this\\noccurs is small. The computational analysis also considers the local asymptotic\\nstability of endemic equilibria and the interplay between vaccination strategy,\\nvaccine efficacy and waning.\", \"main_category\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"categories\": \"q-bio.PE\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T04:00:51Z\"}"}
