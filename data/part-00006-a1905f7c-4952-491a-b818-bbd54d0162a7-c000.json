{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01763v1\", \"title\": \"Fully-gapped superconductivity with rotational symmetry breaking in\\n  pressurized kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$\", \"summary\": \"The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has generated significant\\ninterest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting\\nbehavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we\\nperformed low-temperature, high-pressure $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole\\nresonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in\\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation\\nrate 1/$T_1$ exhibits a kink at $T \\\\sim$ 0.4 $T_\\\\textrm{c}$ within the\\nsuperconducting state and follows a $T^3$ variation as temperature further\\ndecreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line\\nnodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond $P_{\\\\rm c} \\\\sim 1.85$\\nGPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/$T_1$\\nshows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below $T_\\\\textrm{c}$, and decreases rapidly,\\neven faster than $T^5$, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures\\nabove $P_{\\\\rm c}$. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the\\nin-plane upper critical magnetic field $H_{\\\\rm c2}$ breaks the $C_6$ rotational\\nsymmetry. We propose the $s+id$ pairing at $P > P_{\\\\rm c}$ which explains both\\nthe 1/$T_1$ and $H_{\\\\rm c2}$ behaviors. Our findings indicate that\\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state\\nis even more exotic at high pressures.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:17:47Z\"}"}
