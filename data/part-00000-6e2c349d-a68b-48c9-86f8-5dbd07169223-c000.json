This bilateral boundedness is crucial\\nfor the availability of both the gradient and proximal steps, instead of just\\none or the other. We numerically demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed\\nmethod on simple geometrical surfaces in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC,math.DG\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:11:33Z\"}"}
