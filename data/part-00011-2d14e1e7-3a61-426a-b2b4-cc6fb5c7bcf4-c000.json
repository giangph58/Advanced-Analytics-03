{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07593v1\", \"title\": \"Bi-infinite Riordan matrices: a matricial approach to multiplication and\\n  composition of Laurent series\", \"summary\": \"We propose and investigate a bi-infinite matrix approach to the\\nmultiplication and composition of formal Laurent series. We generalize the\\nconcept of Riordan matrix to this bi-infinite context, obtaining matrices that\\nare not necessarily lower triangular and are determined, not by a pair of\\nformal power series, but by a pair of Laurent series. We extend the First\\nFundamental Theorem of Riordan Matrices to this setting, as well as the\\nToeplitz and Lagrange subgroups, that are subgroups of the classical Riordan\\ngroup. Finally, as an illustrative example, we apply our approach to derive a\\nclassical combinatorial identity that cannot be proved using the techniques\\nrelated to the classical Riordan group, showing that our generalization is not\\nfruitless.\", \"main_category\": \"math.GR\", \"categories\": \"math.GR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:45:16Z\"}"}
