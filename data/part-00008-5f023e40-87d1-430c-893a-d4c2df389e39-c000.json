That property is satisfied by movable cones\\nof divisors on various complex projective varieties of Calabi-Yau type, such as\\nabelian varieties and projective hyperk\\\\\\\"ahler manifolds. The property of being\\nwell-clipped has the advantage to descend under taking invariants by a finite\\ngroup action, and to be stable by direct sums. In the class of well-clipped\\ncones, we also provide a simple characterization of those cones that admit a\\nrational polyhedral fundamental domain under some natural group action.\\n  We use this framework to prove the movable cone conjecture for finite\\nquotients of various projective varieties of Calabi-Yau type, notably products\\nof projective primitive symplectic varieties, abelian varieties, and smooth\\nrational surfaces underlying klt Calabi-Yau pairs. This entails Enriques\\nmanifolds. We deduce that such finite quotients admit finitely many unmarked\\nsmall $\\\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial modifications, and that the nef cone conjecture\\nholds for them.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T14:08:08Z\"}"}
