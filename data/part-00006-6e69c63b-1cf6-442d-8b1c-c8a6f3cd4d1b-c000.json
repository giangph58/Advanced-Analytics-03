{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01378v1\", \"title\": \"A Control Barrier Function Approach to Constrained Resource Allocation\\n  Problems in a Maximum Entropy Principle Framework\", \"summary\": \"This paper presents a novel approach to solve capacitated facility location\\nproblems (FLP) that encompass various resource allocation problems. FLPs are a\\nclass of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, involving optimal\\nplacement and assignment of a small number of facilities over a large number of\\ndemand points, with each facility subject to upper and lower bounds on its\\nresource utilization (e.g., the number of demand points it can serve). To\\naddress the challenges posed by inequality constraints and the combinatorial\\nnature of the solution space, we reformulate the problem as a dynamic control\\ndesign problem, enabling structured constraint handling and enhanced solution\\nefficiency. Our method integrates a Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control\\nLyapunov Function (CLF)-based framework with a maximum-entropy principle-based\\nframework to ensure feasibility, optimality, and improved exploration of\\nsolutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly\\nenhances computational efficiency, yielding better solutions and showing\\nnegligible growth in computation time with problem size as compared to existing\\nsolvers. These results highlight the potential of control-theoretic and\\nentropy-based methods for large-scale facility location problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-02T05:47:57Z\"}"}
