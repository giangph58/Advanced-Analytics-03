{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05273v1\", \"title\": \"What We Do Not Know: GPT Use in Business and Management\", \"summary\": \"This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT\\nin business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite\\nidentifying interesting research directions such as best practices,\\nbenchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only\\n42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few\\nstudies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers,\\nbusiness consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough\\ninformation to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in\\nbusinesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for\\nfurther research. We provide a description of current research and identify\\nknowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields\\nof finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and\\nanalytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT\\npotential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs,\\noppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the\\nmedia can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control\\nsystems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business\\nchallenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management\\nresearchers, and to people working on AI in society.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CY\", \"categories\": \"cs.CY\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T17:11:53Z\"}"}
