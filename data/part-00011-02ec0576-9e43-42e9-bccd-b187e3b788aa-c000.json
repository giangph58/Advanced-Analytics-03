Although this behavior may appear to\\nsuggest fractional charge transport, akin to that reported in the fractional\\nquantum Hall regime, the quasi-one-dimensionality of the system and absence of\\nan applied magnetic field indicate that the presence of fractional charges is\\nhighly unlikely. We instead attribute these effects to the presence of one or\\nmore spurious dots, or charge traps, capacitively coupled to the primary dot.\\nOur findings illustrate how signatures of fractional charge transport may be\\nreplicated through trivial mesoscopic Coulombic effects.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:08:20Z\"}"}
