{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24390v1\", \"title\": \"Intertwining bulk and surface: the case of UTe$_2$\", \"summary\": \"UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies\\nin recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its\\nsurface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density\\nwave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we\\npropose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface\\nand in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual\\nfeatures detected by surface probes in this material. Through a\\nphenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental\\nsignatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of\\nCDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii)\\nthe magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the\\nCDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature\\nand its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental\\nchecks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:59:55Z\"}"}
