We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as\\ncertain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted\\non codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The\\nfactorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a\\ncorollary, we solve such critical impurities in the 2d minimal models and\\nestablish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass\\ndeformations in the 3d ${\\\\rm O}(N)$ model.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-th\", \"categories\": \"hep-th,cond-mat.str-el,math.OA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T16:47:34Z\"}"}
