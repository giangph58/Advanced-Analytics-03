To achieve high\\nsensitivity, a high cantilever oscillation frequency is preferable, because it\\ninduces large eddy currents in the material. Higher-order resonance modes of\\nthe cantilever oscillation leads to higher frequency. To discuss such\\nhigh-order-mode oscillation, a differential equation governing MFM cantilever\\noscillation in the high-order resonance mode is formulated, and an analytical\\nsolution of the phase difference is obtained. The result shows that the phase\\ndifference decreases at higher modes, because the effective spring constant\\nincreases faster than the force from the eddy current.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T03:57:12Z\"}"}
