In recent years, hardware developments have led to a\\nsurge in interest in exploiting mixed precision arithmetic within numerical\\nlinear algebra algorithms to take advantage of potential savings in memory\\nrequirements, runtime and energy use, whilst still achieving the requested\\naccuracy. We explore employing mixed precision when solving least-squares\\nproblems, focusing on the practicalities of developing robust approaches using\\nlow precision incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioners. Key penalties\\nassociated with lower precision include a loss of reliability and less accuracy\\nin the computed solution. Through experiments involving problems from practical\\napplications, we study computing incomplete Cholesky factorizations of the\\nnormal matrix using low precision and using the factors to precondition LSQR\\nusing mixed precision. We investigate level-based and memory-limited incomplete\\nfactorization preconditioners. We find that the former are not effective for\\nleast-squares problems while the latter can provide high-quality\\npreconditioners. In particular, half precision arithmetic can be considered if\\nhigh accuracy is not required in the solution or the memory for the incomplete\\nfactors is very restricted; otherwise, single precision can be used, and double\\nprecision accuracy recovered while reducing memory consumption, even for\\nill-conditioned problems.\", \"main_category\": \"math.NA\", \"categories\": \"math.NA,cs.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T09:21:50Z\"}"}
