From the beginning it is assumed that an initial\\nbackground could be arbitrary one. By next steps it is restricted to de Sitter\\nspace that is a novelty for the study of a back-reaction in $f(R)$ gravity.\\nConsideration of the de Sitter space as a background spacetime allows us to\\nprovide the averaging procedure completely. Using the results on the de Sitter\\nspace and generalizing the Isaacson procedure, we construct the averaged\\nenergy-momentum on an additionally curved (averaged) background. Relations of\\nparameters, which preserve the de Sitter picture, and which disturb it are\\ngiven. Our results generalize results of previous authors who use flat\\n(Minkowski) spacetime as the beginning background in $f(R)$ gravity.\", \"main_category\": \"gr-qc\", \"categories\": \"gr-qc\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T03:42:33Z\"}"}
