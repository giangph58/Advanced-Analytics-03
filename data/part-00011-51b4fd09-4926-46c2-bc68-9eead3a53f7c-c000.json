{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07725v1\", \"title\": \"Approximation Algorithms for Connected Maximum Coverage, Minimum\\n  Connected Set Cover, and Node-Weighted Group Steiner Tree\", \"summary\": \"In the Connected Budgeted maximum Coverage problem (CBC), we are given a\\ncollection of subsets $\\\\mathcal{S}$, defined over a ground set $X$, and an\\nundirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where each node is associated with a set of\\n$\\\\mathcal{S}$. Each set in $\\\\mathcal{S}$ has a different cost and each element\\nof $X$ gives a different prize. The goal is to find a subcollection\\n$\\\\mathcal{S}'\\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{S}$ such that $\\\\mathcal{S}'$ induces a\\nconnected subgraph in $G$, the total cost of the sets in $\\\\mathcal{S}'$ does\\nnot exceed a budget $B$, and the total prize of the elements covered by\\n$\\\\mathcal{S}'$ is maximized. The Directed rooted Connected Budgeted maximum\\nCoverage problem (DCBC) is a generalization of CBC where the underlying graph\\n$G$ is directed and in the subgraph induced by $\\\\mathcal{S}'$ in $G$ must be an\\nout-tree rooted at a given node.\\n  The current best algorithms achieve approximation ratios that are linear in\\nthe size of $G$ or depend on $B$. In this paper, we provide two algorithms for\\nCBC and DCBC that guarantee approximation ratios of\\n$O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log^2|X|}{\\\\epsilon^2}\\\\right)$ and\\n$O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{|V|}\\\\log^2|X|}{\\\\epsilon^2}\\\\right)$, resp., with a budget\\nviolation of a factor $1+\\\\epsilon$, where $\\\\epsilon\\\\in (0,1]$.\\n  Our algorithms imply improved approximation factors of other related\\nproblems. For the particular case of DCBC where the prize function is additive,\\nwe improve from $O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^2}|V|^{2/3}\\\\log|V|\\\\right)$ to\\n$O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^2}|V|^{1/2}\\\\log^2|V|\\\\right)$. For the minimum\\nconnected set cover, a minimization version of CBC, and its directed variant,\\nwe obtain approximation factors of $O(\\\\log^3|X|)$ and $O(\\\\sqrt{|V|}\\\\log^3|X|)$,\\nresp. For the Node-Weighted Group Steiner Tree and and its directed variant, we\\nobtain approximation factors of $O(\\\\log^3k)$ and $O(\\\\sqrt{|V|}\\\\log^3k)$, resp.,\\nwhere $k$ is the number of groups.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.DS\", \"categories\": \"cs.DS\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:18:22Z\"}"}
