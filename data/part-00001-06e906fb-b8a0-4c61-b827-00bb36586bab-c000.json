Under the assumption that either 2 is a global unit or the\\nalgebra is of degree 2, we show how the deformation theory of these objects\\nreduces to the deformation theory of the underlying Azumaya algebra. Namely, if\\nthe underlying Azumaya algebra has unobstructed deformations then so does the\\nquadratic pair.\\n  On the other hand, in the purely characteristic 2 setting, we construct an\\nAzumaya algebra with unobstructed deformations which can be equipped with a\\nquadratic pair such that the associated triple has obstructed deformations. Our\\nexample is a biquaternion Azumaya algebra on an Igusa surface.\\n  Independently from the above results, we also introduce a new obstruction for\\nquadratic pairs, existing only in characteristic 2, which is intermediate to\\nboth the strong and weak obstructions that were recently introduced by Gille,\\nNeher, and the second named author. This intermediate obstruction characterizes\\nwhen a canonical extension of the Lie algebra sheaf of the automorphism group\\nscheme of some quadratic triple is split.\", \"main_category\": \"math.AG\", \"categories\": \"math.AG,math.RA\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T16:11:25Z\"}"}
