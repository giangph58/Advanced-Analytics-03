{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24195v1\", \"title\": \"Computational Orthodontic Force Simulation: A Review\", \"summary\": \"In orthodontic treatment, the biological response of the tooth, periodontal\\nligament, and bone complex to orthodontic force is crucial in influencing\\ntreatment outcomes. The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and\\npredicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill\\nthe gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on\\northodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and\\ntechnologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force\\nsimulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an\\nemphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement.\\nStudies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and\\ninvisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as\\nthe predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant\\nfocus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics.\\nCurrent orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering\\nonly the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent\\ndemand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly\\nleveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of\\nforecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and\\nefficiency.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,cs.NA,math.NA\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T15:13:36Z\"}"}
