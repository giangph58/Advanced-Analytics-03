{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05983v1\", \"title\": \"Modular Soft Wearable Glove for Real-Time Gesture Recognition and\\n  Dynamic 3D Shape Reconstruction\", \"summary\": \"With the increasing demand for human-computer interaction (HCI), flexible\\nwearable gloves have emerged as a promising solution in virtual reality,\\nmedical rehabilitation, and industrial automation. However, the current\\ntechnology still has problems like insufficient sensitivity and limited\\ndurability, which hinder its wide application. This paper presents a highly\\nsensitive, modular, and flexible capacitive sensor based on line-shaped\\nelectrodes and liquid metal (EGaIn), integrated into a sensor module tailored\\nto the human hand's anatomy. The proposed system independently captures bending\\ninformation from each finger joint, while additional measurements between\\nadjacent fingers enable the recording of subtle variations in inter-finger\\nspacing. This design enables accurate gesture recognition and dynamic hand\\nmorphological reconstruction of complex movements using point clouds.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that our classifier based on Convolution\\nNeural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an accuracy of\\n99.15% across 30 gestures. Meanwhile, a transformer-based Deep Neural Network\\n(DNN) accurately reconstructs dynamic hand shapes with an Average Distance (AD)\\nof 2.076\\\\pm3.231 mm, with the reconstruction accuracy at individual key points\\nsurpassing SOTA benchmarks by 9.7% to 64.9%. The proposed glove shows excellent\\naccuracy, robustness and scalability in gesture recognition and hand\\nreconstruction, making it a promising solution for next-generation HCI systems.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.RO\", \"categories\": \"cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:39:59Z\"}"}
