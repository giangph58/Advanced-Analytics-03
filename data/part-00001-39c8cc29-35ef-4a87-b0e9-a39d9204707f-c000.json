{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24377v1\", \"title\": \"Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for\\n  Large Language Models\", \"summary\": \"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly\\nenhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from\\nfast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2).\\nWhile System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial\\ncomputational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or\\nunnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is\\ncomputationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it\\nis critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and\\ncomputational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy.\\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in\\nboth the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i)\\nthe cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different\\nreasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy.\\nBy offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to\\nshed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby\\nserving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We\\nalso provide a public repository to continually track developments in this\\nfast-evolving field.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL,cs.AI\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T17:58:07Z\"}"}
