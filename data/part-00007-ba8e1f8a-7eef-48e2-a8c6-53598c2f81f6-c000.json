{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997v1\", \"title\": \"Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of\\n  the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512 512 SPAD array\", \"summary\": \"Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function\\nof photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous\\nmeasurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models\\n(two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and\\nmitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require\\nmultiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them\\nimpractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we\\nintegrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning\\n(DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical\\nmodel. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi\\nmonitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate\\nour approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior\\naccuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional\\nfitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our\\nmethod effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than\\nsingle-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the\\nsystem in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile\\nwaveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array\\nsensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time\\nbrain activity monitoring.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.med-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.med-ph,physics.bio-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T16:09:34Z\"}"}
