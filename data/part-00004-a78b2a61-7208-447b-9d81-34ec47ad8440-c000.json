{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07698v1\", \"title\": \"Proactive User Information Acquisition via Chats on User-Favored Topics\", \"summary\": \"Chat-oriented dialogue systems designed to provide tangible benefits, such as\\nsharing the latest news or preventing frailty in senior citizens, often require\\nProactive acquisition of specific user Information via chats on user-faVOred\\nTopics (PIVOT). This study proposes the PIVOT task, designed to advance the\\ntechnical foundation for these systems. In this task, a system needs to acquire\\nthe answers of a user to predefined questions without making the user feel\\nabrupt while engaging in a chat on a predefined topic. We found that even\\nrecent large language models (LLMs) show a low success rate in the PIVOT task.\\nWe constructed a dataset suitable for the analysis to develop more effective\\nsystems. Finally, we developed a simple but effective system for this task by\\nincorporating insights obtained through the analysis of this dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CL\", \"categories\": \"cs.CL\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T12:32:16Z\"}"}
