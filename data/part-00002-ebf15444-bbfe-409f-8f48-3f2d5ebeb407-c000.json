{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02377v1\", \"title\": \"Research Paper Recommender System by Considering Users' Information\\n  Seeking Behaviors\", \"summary\": \"With the rapid growth of scientific publications, researchers need to spend\\nmore time and effort searching for papers that align with their research\\ninterests. To address this challenge, paper recommendation systems have been\\ndeveloped to help researchers in effectively identifying relevant paper. One of\\nthe leading approaches to paper recommendation is content-based filtering\\nmethod. Traditional content-based filtering methods recommend relevant papers\\nto users based on the overall similarity of papers. However, these approaches\\ndo not take into account the information seeking behaviors that users commonly\\nemploy when searching for literature. Such behaviors include not only\\nevaluating the overall similarity among papers, but also focusing on specific\\nsections, such as the method section, to ensure that the approach aligns with\\nthe user's interests. In this paper, we propose a content-based filtering\\nrecommendation method that takes this information seeking behavior into\\naccount. Specifically, in addition to considering the overall content of a\\npaper, our approach also takes into account three specific sections\\n(background, method, and results) and assigns weights to them to better reflect\\nuser preferences. We conduct offline evaluations on the publicly available DBLP\\ndataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms six\\nbaseline methods in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, MRR, and MAP.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.IR\", \"categories\": \"cs.IR\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T08:11:58Z\"}"}
