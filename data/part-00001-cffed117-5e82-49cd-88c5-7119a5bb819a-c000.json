However,\\ntheir origin is still poorly understood. Observations of quasars show that many\\nsupermassive black holes existed less than 700 million years after the Big\\nBang. To explain the existence of such black holes with masses comparable to\\nthe stellar mass of the host galaxy, just ~500 million years after the Big\\nBang, it is probably necessary to assume that they originated from heavy seeds.\\nIn an ekpyrotic universe, a hot Big Bang occurs as a result of the collision of\\ntwo branes. Quantum fluctuations create ripples on the brane surfaces, leading\\nto spatial variations in the timing of collisions, thereby creating density\\nperturbations that can facilitate the formation of massive black hole seeds. I\\nhypothesize that perhaps Rayleigh-B\\\\'{e}nard-Marangoni type convection in the\\nextra dimension is a more efficient source of macroscopic density perturbations\\nthan quantum fluctuations.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.gen-ph\", \"categories\": \"physics.gen-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T08:51:48Z\"}"}
