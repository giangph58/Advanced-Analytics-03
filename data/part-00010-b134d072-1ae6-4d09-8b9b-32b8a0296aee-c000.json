{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06152v1\", \"title\": \"Uniform deposition of particles in large scale by drying of binary\\n  droplets\", \"summary\": \"The evaporation of liquid droplets often results in a ring-like deposition\\npattern of particles, presenting challenges for applications requiring highly\\nuniform patterns. Despite extensive efforts to suppress the coffee ring effect,\\nachieving a uniform particle distribution remains a great challenge due to the\\ncomplex and non-equilibrium nature of the evaporation process. In this work, we\\nintroduce and demonstrate a one-step drying method for binary droplets (water\\nand 2-methoxyethanol) that produces uniform deposition of nano- and\\nmicro-particles. By adjusting the initial water volume fraction, we effectively\\ncontrol the interplay between capillary and Marangoni flows, resulting in\\ndeposition patterns that vary from coffee ring to uniform and to volcano-like.\\nThrough both theoretical and experimental analyses, we determine the conditions\\nnecessary for achieving such high uniformity. This approach requires no special\\nsubstrate treatment, particle modification, or controlled environments, and\\nworks for various particles, including silica and polystyrene. Our method\\nprovides a robust solution for fabricating uniform patterns that are crucial\\nfor many practical applications, ranging from printing to microelectronics to\\nbio-pharmacy.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.soft\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T15:47:31Z\"}"}
