{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04754v1\", \"title\": \"Design and simulation of GaSe hybrid photonic waveguides on a\\n  \\\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 platform\", \"summary\": \"This study explores the potential of a novel material platform combining\\nGallium Selenide (GaSe) with a \\\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate and Al2O3 cladding for\\nadvanced photonic waveguides. The numerical investigation of the optical\\nperformance of GaSe-based waveguides focuses on key parameters such as power\\nconfinement factor (PCF), propagation loss, and effective mode index for both\\nof the modes of Transverse Electric (TE) as well as Transverse Magnetic (TM).\\nThe results demonstrate that the GaSe/Al2O3/\\\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 waveguide exhibits\\nexcellent optical confinement, with PCF values exceeding 96% for both the TE\\nand TM modes at a wavelength of 1.55 {\\\\mu}m. The waveguide also shows low\\npropagation losses, particularly for the TM mode, making it suitable for\\nlong-wavelength applications. Furthermore, the study highlights the impact of\\ncore dimensions and cladding height on waveguide performance, providing\\ninsights into optimizing the design for minimal loss and maximal efficiency\\nthat demonstrates the potential of III-VI compound-based waveguides. This\\ntreatise also focuses on the bending losses by varying the wavelength and\\nbending radius for both of the TE and TM mode of the GaSe-based waveguide. The\\nwaveguide shows the reflecting loss of -25.08 dB and transmission loss of -5.97\\ndB for the bending radius of 2 {\\\\mu}m and wavelength of 1.55 {\\\\mu}m. This work\\nunderscores the potential of GaSe-based waveguides on a \\\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 platform\\nfor next-generation photonic integrated circuits.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,physics.app-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T06:07:09Z\"}"}
