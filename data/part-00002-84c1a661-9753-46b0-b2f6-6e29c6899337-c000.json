This is particularly useful for decision-making when adapting to sudden\\nshifts in treatment patterns is essential. We propose a doubly robust-style\\nestimator for counterfactual regression within a generalizable framework that\\naccommodates a broad class of risk functions and flexible constraints, drawing\\non tools from semiparametric theory and stochastic optimization. Our approach\\nuses incremental interventions to enhance adaptability while maintaining\\nconsistency with standard methods. We formulate the target estimand as the\\noptimal solution to a stochastic optimization problem and develop an efficient\\nestimation strategy, where we can leverage rapid development of modern\\noptimization algorithms. We go on to analyze the rates of convergence and\\ncharacterize the asymptotic distributions. Our analysis shows that the proposed\\nestimators can achieve $\\\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality for a\\nbroad class of problems. Numerical illustrations highlight their effectiveness\\nin adapting to unseen counterfactual scenarios while maintaining parametric\\nconvergence rates.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME,cs.LG,stat.ML\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:32:26Z\"}"}
