{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24130v1\", \"title\": \"Graph Neural Network-Based Predictive Modeling for Robotic Plaster\\n  Printing\", \"summary\": \"This work proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) modeling approach to predict\\nthe resulting surface from a particle based fabrication process. The latter\\nconsists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is\\nfacilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using\\nthe robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction,\\nas well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a\\nparticle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the\\nadoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an\\nencoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from\\nlaboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a\\nBayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing\\nprocess, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory\\nand the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of\\nan autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is\\nassessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data,\\nwhich shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with\\nthe performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a\\nsignificant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better\\nperformance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CE\", \"categories\": \"cs.CE,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T14:15:00Z\"}"}
