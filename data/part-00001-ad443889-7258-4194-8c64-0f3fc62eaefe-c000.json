{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23702v1\", \"title\": \"3D Dental Model Segmentation with Geometrical Boundary Preserving\", \"summary\": \"3D intraoral scan mesh is widely used in digital dentistry diagnosis,\\nsegmenting 3D intraoral scan mesh is a critical preliminary task. Numerous\\napproaches have been devised for precise tooth segmentation. Currently, the\\ndeep learning-based methods are capable of the high accuracy segmentation of\\ncrown. However, the segmentation accuracy at the junction between the crown and\\nthe gum is still below average. Existing down-sampling methods are unable to\\neffectively preserve the geometric details at the junction. To address these\\nproblems, we propose CrossTooth, a boundary-preserving segmentation method that\\ncombines 3D mesh selective downsampling to retain more vertices at the\\ntooth-gingiva area, along with cross-modal discriminative boundary features\\nextracted from multi-view rendered images, enhancing the geometric\\nrepresentation of the segmentation network. Using a point network as a backbone\\nand incorporating image complementary features, CrossTooth significantly\\nimproves segmentation accuracy, as demonstrated by experiments on a public\\nintraoral scan dataset.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T04:00:11Z\"}"}
