{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23935v1\", \"title\": \"Nonparametric function-on-scalar regression using deep neural networks\", \"summary\": \"We focus on nonlinear Function-on-Scalar regression, where the predictors are\\nscalar variables, and the responses are functional data. Most existing studies\\napproximate the hidden nonlinear relationships using linear combinations of\\nbasis functions, such as splines. However, in classical nonparametric\\nregression, it is known that these approaches lack adaptivity, particularly\\nwhen the true function exhibits high spatial inhomogeneity or anisotropic\\nsmoothness. To capture the complex structure behind data adaptively, we propose\\na simple adaptive estimator based on a deep neural network model. The proposed\\nestimator is straightforward to implement using existing deep learning\\nlibraries, making it accessible for practical applications. Moreover, we derive\\nthe convergence rates of the proposed estimator for the anisotropic Besov\\nspaces, which consist of functions with varying smoothness across dimensions.\\nOur theoretical analysis shows that the proposed estimator mitigates the curse\\nof dimensionality when the true function has high anisotropic smoothness, as\\nshown in the classical nonparametric regression. Numerical experiments\\ndemonstrate the superior adaptivity of the proposed estimator, outperforming\\nexisting methods across various challenging settings. Moreover, the proposed\\nmethod is applied to analyze ground reaction force data in the field of sports\\nmedicine, demonstrating more efficient estimation compared to existing\\napproaches.\", \"main_category\": \"stat.ME\", \"categories\": \"stat.ME\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T10:34:50Z\"}"}
