They are performed using final states with three isolated leptons\\n(electrons or muons) and are based on $\\\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton\\ncollision data with an integrated luminosity of $140\\\\,\\\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$,\\nrecorded from 2015 to 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\\nCollider. Measurements of the $t\\\\bar{t}\\\\ell^{+}\\\\ell^{-}$ signal strength and\\ncross-section upper-limits are performed inclusively in lepton flavour and\\nseparately for electrons and muons. The study also aims to probe anomalous\\nfour-fermion interactions including to test for possible lepton flavor\\nuniversality violation. No significant deviations from the Standard Model\\npredictions are observed and the measurements are interpreted through the EFT\\nformalism to provide new constraints on relevant operators.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-ex\", \"categories\": \"hep-ex\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:18:22Z\"}"}
