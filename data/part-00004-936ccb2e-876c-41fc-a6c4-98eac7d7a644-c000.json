We propose a relaxed weak accelerated proximal gradient (R-WAPG) method,\\na generic algorithm that unifies the convergence results for strongly convex\\nand convex problems where the extrapolation constant is characterized by a\\nsequence that is much weaker than Nesterov's rule. Our R-WAPG provides a\\nunified framework for several notable Euclidean variants of FISTA and verifies\\ntheir convergences. In addition, we provide the convergence rate of strongly\\nconvex objective with a constant momentum term. Without using the idea of\\nrestarting, we also reformulate R-WAPG as ``Free R-WAPG\\\" so that it doesn't\\nrequire any parameter. Explorative numerical experiments were conducted to show\\nits competitive advantages.\", \"main_category\": \"math.OC\", \"categories\": \"math.OC\", \"published\": \"2025-04-09T04:05:54Z\"}"}
