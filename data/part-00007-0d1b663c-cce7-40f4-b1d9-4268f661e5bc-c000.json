{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02689v1\", \"title\": \"Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot\\n  electrons in aluminum nanoantennas\", \"summary\": \"Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an\\nobject and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also\\noccur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation\\nthat has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling\\nbetween localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in\\naluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy\\nloss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling\\nis observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface\\nplasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the\\nhybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which\\ncorresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is\\nobtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the\\nhot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that\\nefficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared\\nregion, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon\\nresonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode,\\nas its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the\\nIT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum\\nnanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and\\nnear-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry,\\nphotodetection, and solar energy harvesting.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.optics\", \"categories\": \"physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T15:29:07Z\"}"}
