Addressing the challenge, a Large\\nLanguage Model (LLM)-driven method is established in this paper for the\\nautonomous merging of 3D printing work orders, integrated with a\\nmemory-augmented learning strategy. In industrial scenarios, both device and\\norder features are modeled into LLM-readable natural language prompt templates,\\nand develop an order-device matching tool along with a merging interference\\nchecking module. By incorporating a self-memory learning strategy, an\\nintelligent agent for autonomous order merging is constructed, resulting in\\nimproved accuracy and precision in order allocation. The proposed method\\neffectively leverages the strengths of LLMs in industrial applications while\\nreducing hallucination.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.AI\", \"categories\": \"cs.AI,cs.RO\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:50:29Z\"}"}
