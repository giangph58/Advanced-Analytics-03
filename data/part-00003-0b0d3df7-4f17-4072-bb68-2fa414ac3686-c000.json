However, the first-principle determination\\nof HQET LCDAs faces significant theoretical challenges. In this presentation,\\nwe introduce a practical approach to address these obstacles. This makes\\nsequential use of effective field theories. Leveraging the newly-generated\\nlattice ensembles, we present a pioneering lattice calculation, offering new\\ninsights into LCDAs for heavy mesons. Additionally, we discuss the impact of\\nthese results on the heavy-to-light form factors and briefly give potential\\nfuture directions in this field.\", \"main_category\": \"hep-lat\", \"categories\": \"hep-lat,hep-ex,hep-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-03T10:17:38Z\"}"}
