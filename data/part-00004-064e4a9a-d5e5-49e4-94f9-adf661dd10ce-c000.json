The analyst does not\\nhave access to the agent's information and ponders whether the observed actions\\ncould be justified through a rational Bayesian model with a known utility\\nfunction. We show that the observed actions cannot be justified if and only if\\nthere is a single deviation argument that leaves the agent better off,\\nregardless of the information. The result is then extended to allow for\\ndistributions over possible action sequences. Four applications are presented:\\nmonotonicity of rationalization with risk aversion, a potential rejection of\\nthe Bayesian model with observable data, feasible outcomes in dynamic\\ninformation design, and partial identification of preferences without\\nassumptions on information.\", \"main_category\": \"econ.TH\", \"categories\": \"econ.TH,econ.EM\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T16:43:26Z\"}"}
