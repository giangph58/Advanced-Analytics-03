However, the three-dimensional\\ncoordinate-space calculation of the phases is computationally demanding. We aim\\nto generalize the Fermi Operator Expansion (FOE) method that is effective for\\nfinite-temperature coordinate-space simulation, from the Hartree-Fock theory to\\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory including the pairing effects.\\nFurthermore, the periodic structure with free neutrons in the inner crust\\nrequires us to treat the system with the band theory. We give a concise proof\\nthat the generalized density matrix in the HFB theory can be obtained with the\\nFOE. The Chebyshev polynomial expansion is used for calculations of the HFB\\nband theory. Using a model for a slab phase of the inner crust, the FOE method\\nproduces results in good agreement with those based on the diagonalization of\\nthe HFB Hamiltonian. The FOE method for the HFB band theory is a powerful tool\\nfor studying the non-trivial exotic structures in neutron stars. The FOE method\\nis suitable for parallelization and further acceleration is possible with\\nnearsightedness.\", \"main_category\": \"nucl-th\", \"categories\": \"nucl-th\", \"published\": \"2025-04-07T05:13:18Z\"}"}
