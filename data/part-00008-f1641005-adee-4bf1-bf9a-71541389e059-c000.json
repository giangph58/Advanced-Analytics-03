{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05944v1\", \"title\": \"Laminar chaos in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay\", \"summary\": \"A type of chaos called laminar chaos was found in singularly perturbed\\ndynamical systems with periodically [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 084102 (2018)] and\\nquasiperiodically [Phys. Rev. E 107, 014205 (2023)] time-varying delay.\\nCompared to high-dimensional turbulent chaos that is typically found in such\\nsystems with large constant delay, laminar chaos is a very low-dimensional\\nphenomenon. It is characterized by a time series with nearly constant laminar\\nphases that are interrupted by irregular bursts, where the intensity level of\\nthe laminar phases varies chaotically from phase to phase. In this paper, we\\ndemonstrate that laminar chaos, and its generalizations, can also be observed\\nin systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay. Moreover, while for\\nperiodic and quasiperiodic delays the appearance of (generalized) laminar chaos\\nand turbulent chaos depends in a fractal manner on the delay parameters, it\\nturns out that short-time correlated random and chaotic delays lead to\\n(generalized) laminar chaos in almost the whole delay parameter space, where\\nthe properties of circle maps with quenched disorder play a crucial role. It\\nfollows that introducing such a delay variation typically leads to a drastic\\nreduction of the dimension of the chaotic attractor of the considered systems.\\nWe investigate the dynamical properties and generalize the known methods for\\ndetecting laminar chaos in experimental time series to random and chaotically\\ntime-varying delay.\", \"main_category\": \"nlin.CD\", \"categories\": \"nlin.CD\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:57:49Z\"}"}
