Despite advancements in autonomous\\ndriving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to\\ncapture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world\\ndriving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware\\nmodel for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving\\nscenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection\\nwith multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene\\nunderstanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions,\\nare modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic\\nreasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated\\nthrough CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while\\nGrad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on\\nthe DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.\", \"main_category\": \"cs.CV\", \"categories\": \"cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG\", \"published\": \"2025-04-08T11:06:02Z\"}"}
