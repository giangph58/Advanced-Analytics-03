Despite its clinical importance, the\\ndiagnosis of FCD is very difficult in MRI because of subtle abnormalities,\\nleading to misdiagnosis. This study investigates the use of 3D convolutional\\nneural networks (3D-CNNs) for FCD detection, using a dataset of 170 subjects\\n(85 FCD patients and 85 controls) composed of T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI scans.\\nIn particular, it investigates the benefits obtained from cross-modality\\ntransfer learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, in\\nparticular Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet\\narchitectures (ResNet-18, -34, and -50) were implemented, employing transfer\\nlearning strategies that used pre-trained weights from segmentation tasks.\\nResults indicate that transfer learning significantly enhances classification\\naccuracy (up to 80.3%) and interpretability, as measured by a novel Heat-Score\\nmetric, which evaluates the model's focus on clinically relevant regions.\\nImprovements in the Heat-Score metric underscore the model's seizure zone\\nlocalization capabilities, bringing AI predictions and clinical insights closer\\ntogether. These results highlight the importance of transfer learning,\\nincluding cross-modality, and XAI in advancing AI-based medical diagnostics,\\nespecially for difficult-to-diagnose pathologies such as FCD.\", \"main_category\": \"eess.IV\", \"categories\": \"eess.IV,cs.CV,physics.med-ph\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T14:15:16Z\"}"}
