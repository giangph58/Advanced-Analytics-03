This study analyzes and characterizes the electronic noise of the\\ndetector readout chain to develop a comprehensive noise model. The model\\nenables the generation of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate systematic\\neffects in signal processing. The analysis is based on data collected from 32\\nresistive Micromegas detectors, recorded without zero suppression. All\\ndetectors exhibit a quasi-identical and time-stable noise level. The developed\\nanalytical model accurately describes the observed noise, and derived Monte\\nCarlo simulations show excellent agreement with experimental data.\", \"main_category\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"categories\": \"physics.ins-det\", \"published\": \"2025-04-10T13:56:40Z\"}"}
