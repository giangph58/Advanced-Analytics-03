High-entropy\\nantimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal\\nstructure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a\\nconventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed\\ninvestigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the\\nreversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and\\nan entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical\\nresistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase\\nM1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at\\n2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides\\nnumerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as\\nsuperconductors.\", \"main_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\", \"categories\": \"cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el\", \"published\": \"2025-03-31T03:44:44Z\"}"}
