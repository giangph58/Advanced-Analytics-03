{"value":"{\"aid\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21736v1\", \"title\": \"Local Primordial non-Gaussian Bias from Time Evolution\", \"summary\": \"Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a signature of fundamental physics in the\\nearly universe that is probed by cosmological observations. It is well known\\nthat the local type of PNG generates a strong signal in the two-point function\\nof large-scale structure tracers, such as galaxies. This signal, often termed\\n``scale-dependent bias'' is a generic feature of modulation of gravitational\\nstructure formation by a large-scale mode. It is less well-appreciated that the\\ncoefficient controlling this signal, $b_{\\\\phi}$, is closely connected to the\\ntime evolution of the tracer number density. This correspondence between time\\nevolution and local PNG can be simply explained for a universal tracer whose\\nmass function only depends on peak height, and more generally for non-universal\\ntracers in the separate universe picture, which we validate in simulations. We\\nalso describe how to recover the bias of tracers subject to a survey selection\\nfunction, and perform a simple demonstration on simulated galaxies. Since the\\nlocal PNG amplitude in $n-$point statistics ($f_{\\\\rm NL}$) is largely\\ndegenerate with the coefficient $b_{\\\\phi}$, this proof of concept study\\ndemonstrates that galaxy survey data can allow for more optimal and robust\\nextraction of local PNG information from upcoming surveys.\", \"main_category\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO\", \"published\": \"2025-03-27T17:49:31Z\"}"}
